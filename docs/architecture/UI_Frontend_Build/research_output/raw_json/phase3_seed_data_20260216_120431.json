Athletes push a sled over 50 meters (2 x 25m), with weights stacked depending on the division.\n\nThe listed weight includes the sled (usually ~30\u201340 kg) plus added plates.\n\n**Open Women**: 102 kg **Pro Women**: 152 kg **Open Men**: 152 kg **Pro Men**: 202 kg\n\nTip: Traction and pushing form matter more than brute strength.\n\n## HYROX Sled Pull weight\n\nThe HYROX sled pull station uses the same sled as the sled push, but now you're pulling it 50 meters (2 x 25m) with arm and back strength.\n\nThe weights are slightly lower than the sled push.\n\n**Open Women**: 78 kg **Pro Women**: 103 kg **Open Men**: 103 kg **Pro Men**: 153 kg\n\nTrain with heavy rope pulls and seated row variations.\n\n## Farmers Carry HYROX Weights\n\nYou\u2019ll carry two kettlebells or dumbbells over a 200 meter course.\n\nCore and grip endurance are key for the HYROX farmers carry.\n\n**Open Women**: 2 \u00d7 16 kg **Pro Women**: 2 \u00d7 24 kg **Open Men**: 2 \u00d7 24 kg **Pro Men**: 2 \u00d7 32 kg\n\nPro tip: Keep shoulders back and walk tall to avoid fatigue.\n\n\u2026\n\n## HYROX Wall Ball weight\n\nThe race ends with HYROX wall balls: squat and throw to a target.\n\nThe weight and rep count depend on your category.\n\n**Open Women**: 100 reps with 4 kg to a 2.70 m target **Pro Women**: 100 reps with 6 kg to a 2.70 m target **Open Men**: 100 reps with 6 kg to a 3 m target **Pro Men**: 100 reps with 9 kg to a 3 m target\n\nAccuracy and pacing are critical here.",

This change effectively reduced the men's and women's push and pull sleds by about 10\u00a0kg each, which is reflected in the slew of record breaking times during that season.",

          "snippet": "Pro vs. Open: For experienced athletes seeking an extra challenge, HYROX also offers Pro Doubles divisions (for same-sex teams). Pro doubles follow the exact same format but with heavier weights at the workout stations. For example, in an Open Men's doubles race the wall ball weight is 6 kg, whereas in Pro Men's doubles it's 9 kg, and other stations have similarly increased loads for pros.\n(Women's Pro doubles use weights equivalent to the Open Men's standards in many stations, such as a 6 kg ball instead of the usual 4 kg.) Mixed doubles teams only compete in the Open category (there is no separate \u201cPro Mixed\u201d division at regular events), but note that the mixed teams use a hybrid weight setup \u2013 essentially male Open weights (and female Pro weights) for all stations.\n\n\u2026\n\nFor Doubles, both partners must accept within the deadline. As of Season 2025/26, qualification is generally tied to the Pro division (with exceptions such as 60+ athletes and Mixed Doubles, plus Regional Championship qualifiers). At the World Championships, most athletes race with Pro weights/reps; exceptions include Mixed Doubles and 60+ age groups (who race Open weights). Partner substitutions at World Championships are generally not permitted, and any exception (e.g., proven illness/injury) requires HYROX approval\u2014always check the latest official communications for your event.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe only exceptions are mixed doubles and the oldest age groups: Mixed teams at Worlds use the men's Open weights (slightly lighter than full pro) to account for the gender difference, and any 60+ age group athletes also stick with Open-level weights. Within each age group at Worlds, the fastest team is crowned that Age Group's World Champion \u2013 a prestigious title on its own.",

          "snippet": "The Farmer\u2019s Carry is the sixth station in a HYROX event. You need to complete a distance of 200m with the kettlebells in your hands.\n\nWhen you reach the Farmer\u2019s Carry station, you will have already have completed 6km of running and 5 functional stations (SkiErg, sled push, sled pull, burpee broad jumps and rowing).\n\n\u2026\n\nGrip strength is obviously a factor when it comes to the Farmers Carry in HYROX. Anything that challenges your grip is, in some way, preparing you for this station. Pull-ups, heavy holds, dead hangs and carries all help.\n\nThat said, a fast Farmers Carry time is not just about grip\u2026\n\nIn a conversation with Dr Adam Storey, exercise physiologist and HYROX Sports Science Advisory Council member, on the Rox Lyfe podcast, he said:\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2022 Heavier carries over shorter distances\n\nFor example:\n\n\u2022 3 rounds of 150m at race weight\n\n\u2022 Or 3 rounds of 60 to 80m at a load above race weight\n\nFarmers Carry is often overlooked because there is always more running to do, more sled work to fit in, more wall balls to survive.",

The race was \ndesigned by Mintra Tilly, who also wrote the rulebook.\nHYROX consists of a 1 km run followed by 1 station, \nrepeated 8 times. In order to complete the entire \nHYROX race and receive a valid finishing time, the \nracers must complete the runs and stations in the \nspecific order [Run 1, workout station 1, Run 2, \nworkout station 2, etc.] until they have completed a \ntotal of 8 km running and 8 stations.\nWhilst the repetition range and/or weights differ \nbetween the divisions, the running distance remains \nthe same across all divisions: each racer must run 1 \nkm before each, i.e. a total distance of 8 km.\nThe results and ranking system are based on the \nfastest time in each respective division. Results \nare sorted from the fastest to the slowest time. In \naddition to the overall fastest men\u2019s and women\u2019s \ntimes, results are also ranked in age groups [see \nbelow], also sorted from the fastest to the slowest \ntime.\n\nHYROX EN SINGLE RULEBOOK_25/26\n5\n2 CONDITIONS OF \nPARTICIPATION\nHYROX is a race open to everyone, qualifications are \nnot required.\nBy participating in HYROX you are agreeing to the \nfollowing conditions, which include the exclusion of \nliability and the terms of the Privacy Policy which can \nbe read at https://hyrox.com/terms-and-conditions/.\n1 \nIn order to participate in a HYROX event, racers \nmust be at least 16 years old on the day of race.\n2 \nOfficial rankings will be based on racers\u2019 biological \ngender at birth. However, individuals who wish to \nparticipate for recreational purposes only, without \nbeing included in the official ranking, may register \nunder their gender identity.\n3 \nEach racer must agree to the terms and conditions \nof participation.\n4 \nThe only way to register for a HYROX event is via \nwww.hyrox.com.\n2.1 CONDITIONS OF \nPARTICIPATION IN HYROX\n2.2 PRECONDITIONS FOR \nPARTICIPATION\nPregnant women are welcome to participate. However, \nthe participation in any race during pregnancy \nremains solely at the discretion and responsibility \nof the pregnant individual. As every pregnancy is \nunique, we strongly recommend consulting a medical \nprofessional prior to participating in a race, in order to \nassess any potential risks.\nAny pregnant racer who would like to adapt any \nmovements or modify the prescribed weights/reps, \nshould contact the HYROX team in advance.

Surprisingly, the average for pro women is only a few minutes faster than the open single, at 1:27:03 \u2013 though of course they have to work with heavier weights \u2013 suggesting that many competitively fit individuals who could probably take on the pro race participate in the open category.\nLauren Weeks holds the world record as of March 2025 with a 56:22 completion time, and was the first woman to break the sub-57-minute mark.\n\n## What is the average time for each Hyrox station?\n\nThese are the average times it takes women to complete each of the eight stations, plus the transition time in the Roxzone \u2013 the transition area between the running portion and each individual station \u2013 in the everyday and pro divisions.",

Your 5K PR won't directly predict your HYROX time. The strength stations level the playing field between runners and strength athletes.\n\n### Common Athlete Profiles\n\n**The Runner**\n\n- 5K: 18-20 min\n\n- Strength training: Minimal\n\n- Expected HYROX: 1:30-1:40 (men), 1:50-2:00 (women)\n\n**Bottleneck:**Sled push (152kg/102kg), sled pull, wall balls\n\n**The CrossFitter**\n\n- 5K: 22-24 min\n\n- CrossFit: 3+ years\n\n- Expected HYROX: 1:25-1:35 (men), 1:40-1:50 (women)\n\n**Bottleneck:**Running endurance, pacing the 8km\n\n**The Balanced Athlete**\n\n- 5K: 20-22 min\n\n- Strength training: 2-3x/week\n\n- Expected HYROX: 1:20-1:30 (men), 1:35-1:45 (women)\n\n**Advantage:**No major weaknesses\n\nPure runners often overestimate their HYROX performance by 10-15 minutes, while CrossFitters underestimate theirs by 5-10 minutes. Train both equally for best results.\n\n## What Makes an Elite HYROX Time?\n\nBreaking into elite territory (\n\n**sub-1:15 men**, **sub-1:24 women**) requires four key elements:\n\n### Sub-5:00/km Running Pace\n\nElite athletes average\n\n**4:30-4:50/km** across all 8km of running, even when fatigued from stations.\n\n### Station Efficiency\n\n|Station|Elite Time (Men)|Elite Time (Women)|\n|--|--|--|\n|SkiErg (1000m)|3:50-4:20|4:30-5:00|\n|Sled Push (152kg/102kg)|2:50-3:26|2:50-3:25|\n|Sled Pull (103kg/78kg)|3:50-4:37|4:15-4:59|\n|Burpee Broad Jumps|4:00-4:37|5:15-5:57|\n|Row (1000m)|4:00-4:33|4:45-5:11|\n|Farmers Carry (48kg/32kg)|1:45-1:59|2:00-2:15|\n|Lunges (20kg/10kg)|3:50-4:24|4:00-4:30|\n|Wall Balls (100 reps)|5:30-6:04|5:20-5:53|\nOne bad station can cost you 5-10 minutes. Elite athletes have NO stations slower than 80th percentile\u2014they're well-rounded, not specialists.\n\n### Minimal RoxZone Time\n\nElite athletes average 4-5 minutes total RoxZone time. Intermediate athletes average 7-8.5 minutes, while beginners may take 9-12 minutes or more.\n\n**RoxZone includes:**\n\n- Running from finish line to station\n\n- Running from station to next start line\n\n- Brief mental prep and equipment setup\n\n### Mental Toughness\n\nThe ability to maintain pace when everything hurts. Elite athletes don't slow down\u2014they manage discomfort better.\n\n## How to Improve Your HYROX Time\n\nBased on your current level:\n\n### Beginners (1:40-2:10)\n\n**Focus:** Finish strong, build base fitness\n\n**Training priorities:**\n\n- Run 3-4x per week at conversational pace\n\n- Practice all 8 stations 1x per week\n\n- Focus on technique before speed\n\nDon't worry about speed yet. Learn proper form on all stations\u2014especially sled push/pull technique with the heavy weights (152kg/103kg for men, 102kg/78kg for women).\u2705\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf Ready to train smarter?** Our 12-Week HYROX Training Program takes you from beginner to race-ready with structured workouts, station technique guides, and proven pacing strategies. Just **$29.99** \u2014 less than a single PT session. Start training smart today.\n\n### Intermediate (1:25-1:40 / 1:37-1:54)\n\n**Focus:** Identify weak stations, improve pacing\n\n**Training priorities:**\n\n- Track your split times\u2014find your slowest 2 stations using our race analyzer tool\n\n- Add 1-2 specific station workouts per week\n\n- Practice negative splitting (running faster as race progresses)\n\n- Use our pacing calculator to set realistic split targets\n\n**Example weakness work:**\n\n- Slow at sled push? Add 2x/week heavy sled work\n\n- Slow at wall balls? Practice 100-rep sets 2x/week\n\n### Advanced (1:15-1:25 / 1:24-1:37)\n\n**Focus:** Fine-tune pacing, maximize efficiency\n\n**Training priorities:**\n\n- Interval training 2x per week (tempo runs, VO2 max)\n\n- Station-specific drills 2-3x per week at race weight\n\n- Practice race-pace RoxZone transitions (sprint between stations)\n\n- Mental toughness training (running under fatigue)\n\n- Analyze your performance data with our race analyzer tool\n\n**Want to break through to the next level?** Our structured 12-week program includes progressive periodization, race simulation protocols, and advanced pacing strategies designed to take intermediate athletes to sub-1:20 performance.\n\n### Elite (under 1:15 / 1:24)\n\n**Focus:** Marginal gains, competition strategy\n\n**Training priorities:**\n\n- Periodized training blocks (build, peak, taper)\n\n- Race simulation workouts every 2-3 weeks\n\n- Video analysis of technique on all stations\n\n- Strategic pacing per course (elevation, heat, competition)\n\n## Realistic Time Improvement Expectations\ud83d\udca1\n\nMost athletes improve 15-25% from their first to second race simply by understanding pacing, knowing the stations, and better race-day nutrition.\n\n**First year:** 15-25% improvement\n\n**Year 2-3:** 5-10% annual improvement with consistent training\n\n**Plateau:** Most athletes plateau after 3-5 years unless they significantly change training\n\n### Example Progression (Male, 30-34):\n\n**First race:**1:55:00 (beginner) **6 months later:**1:40:00 (intermediate) \u2192 13% improvement **1 year later:**1:25:00 (advanced) \u2192 15% improvement **2 years later:**1:15:00 (elite) \u2192 12% improvement **3+ years:**1:10-1:14 (peak elite performance)\n\n## Station Benchmarks: Where Are You Losing Time?\n\nHere's what \"good\" looks like for each station (Men / Women, Intermediate level):\n\n|Station|Intermediate (M/W)|Advanced (M/W)|\n|--|--|--|\n|SkiErg|4:27 / 5:11|4:20 / 5:00|\n|Sled Push|3:41 / 3:42|3:26 / 3:25|\n|Sled Pull|5:06 / 5:34|4:37 / 4:59|\n|Burpee Broad Jumps|5:19 / 6:50|4:37 / 5:57|\n|Row|4:44 / 5:24|4:33 / 5:11|\n|Farmers Carry|2:10 / 2:25|1:59 / 2:15|\n|Lunges|4:56 / 5:01|4:24 / 4:30|\n|Wall Balls|7:01 / 6:51|6:04 / 5:53|\nIf any of your stations are slower than the \"Intermediate\" column, that's your biggest opportunity for improvement.

Focus on improving YOUR time, not comparing yourself to elites. Every PR is worth celebrating.\n\n## FAQs\n\n**Q: What's the average HYROX finish time?**\n\nA: Men average around 1:40:00, women average around 1:54:00 across all age groups and divisions. The median (50th percentile) is slightly faster at 1:33-1:38 for men and 1:47-1:52 for women.\n\n**Q: Is sub 1:30 good for a first race?**\n\nA: Absolutely! Sub 1:30 for men puts you in the advanced category (top 30%). For women, sub 1:45 is also advanced level.\n\n**Q: How long does it take to go from beginner to elite?**\n\nA: Most athletes need 3-5 years of consistent, structured training. Expect 10-20% annual improvement in your first 2 years.\n\n**Q: Do pros use different weights?**\n\nA: No. Pro and Open athletes use the same weights (152kg sled push for men, 102kg for women). Only age group 60+ uses modified weights.\n\n**Q: Why are the sleds so heavy?**\n\nA: HYROX uses 152kg (men) and 102kg (women) for sled push to test strength-endurance. The heavy sleds separate pure runners from hybrid athletes.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions About HYROX Times\n\n### What is a good HYROX time for beginners?\n\nFor beginners, a good HYROX time is 1:40-1:54 for men and 1:54-2:10 for women. If you finish your first race in this range, you're performing better than about 50% of HYROX athletes. Focus on completing the race and building a baseline\u2014you can improve your times with targeted training.\n\n### What is the average HYROX time?\n\nThe average HYROX time for men is approximately 1:35, while women average around 1:50. However, this varies significantly by age group, with younger athletes (25-35) typically finishing 5-10 minutes faster than those in the 45-55 age bracket.\n\n### What HYROX time is considered elite?\n\nElite HYROX times are under 1:15 for men and under 1:26 for women. These times put you in the top 10% of all HYROX finishers globally and typically require years of focused training in both running and functional fitness.\n\n### How do HYROX times vary by age?\n\nHYROX times typically slow by 2-3 minutes per decade after age 35. A 1:30 time for a 25-year-old male would be equivalent to approximately 1:37 for a 45-year-old athlete with similar training. Our age group analysis shows detailed breakdowns by age bracket.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYour best time is one you're proud of. Whether you're chasing a PR, trying to beat a friend, or just finishing your first race\u2014every HYROX time represents hours of hard work.\n\nUse these benchmarks to set realistic goals and train smarter, not to judge your worth as an athlete.\n\n**Related Articles:**\n\n- Age Group Performance Analysis \u2014 Detailed age breakdown\n\n- Average Split Times by Age Group \u2014 Realistic benchmarks\n\n- First HYROX Race Guide \u2014 Complete beginner guide\n\n- How to Beat 1:30 \u2014 Complete training requirements\n\n",

          "snippet": "If you\u2019re looking to test your fitness and push your limits, HYROX might just be the perfect challenge.\n\nThe event combines eight different workouts, and 8km of running, into one intense event. Afterwards participants are provided with a detailed breakdown of their times, and position, over each section of the race. But if you\u2019ve not yet competed, you might be wondering what is a good HYROX time?\n\nIn this blog post we\u2019ll look at what can be considered a good time for this fitness event that we love. For a much more comprehensive look into what HYROX is, and how the race is structured, check out our Beginners Guide to HYROX.\n\n**It\u2019s You vs You**\n\nWhilst it is possible to compare your time against the times of others, and there are podium spots, World Championships and Elite races to (potentially) qualify for, for 99% of people taking part in HYROX is about your own personal achievement and doing your best. How you stack up against others is something that most people\n\n*will* look at, but it also shouldn\u2019t really matter\u2026\n\nEveryone comes from different backgrounds, have varying amounts of sporting experience, are able to dedicate differing amounts of time to their training, are different ages, and so on. Therefore, what might be considered a \u201cgood\u201d HYROX time to one person, might not be considered \u201cgood\u201d to another. I firmly believe people should approach HYROX as a fun way to push their limits, improve their health and fitness levels, and simply do the best they can do. That all said, I will obviously try to give you some guidance regarding completion time!\n\n**What is the Average HYROX Time?**\n\nThe average finisher time for HYROX in the individual division is around 90 minutes. However, this can vary depending on division and age group.\n\nThe average times by division are shown below\u2026\n\nHYROX Men \u2013 1:35:00\n\nHYROX Women \u2013 1:38:02\n\nHYROX Men DOUBLES \u2013 1:19:22\n\nHYROX Women DOUBLES \u2013 1:28:43\n\nHYROX Mixed DOUBLES \u2013 1:25:26\n\nHYROX PRO Men \u2013 1:30:41\n\nHYROX PRO Women \u2013 1:31:22\n\n**Slower than Average?**\n\nThere\u2019s a couple of points worth highlighting when looking at the average HYROX finish time\u2026\n\nFirstly, these are the average times of people who compete in HYROX. In general, those who do race in HYROX are fitter than your average person, so if you are below average that is far from being something to be ashamed of!\n\nSecondly, experience counts for a lot in HYROX. We give lots of tips on this site for improving your time, and share some of the common mistakes to avoid, but you don\u2019t truly know what a HYROX event is like until you\u2019ve done one. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that a beginner / first timer to HYROX,\n\n__on average__, would be slower than a more experienced competitor.\n\n**What is a Good HYROX Finishing Time?**\n\nAs already mentioned, what might be considered \u201cgood\u201d time will differ from person to person. However, here are some rough benchmarks:\n\n**Elite Athletes** \u2013 The Elite of HYROX (the \u201cElite 15\u201d) can complete an individual, Pro weight HYROX event in under 56mins for the Men, and under 62mins for the Women. These athletes have exceptional fitness levels, and they are the very best of the best in the sport (and compete each season for the title of HYROX World Champion). Over the years it is likely that these times will continue to improve as more athletes enter the sport and dedicate all their training to HYROX.\n\n**Competitive Athletes** \u2013 Competitive athletes, with a strong athletic background and prior experience in similar events, and who are in contention for a podium in their age group, and / or World Championship qualification, aim for a time between 60-75 minutes (very roughly!). However, this will depend on someone\u2019s age group, sex and division. From around age 40 onwards, the average times for the age group will typically start to slow a little. You can get an idea for times by your age group from the HYROX website, or by checking the HYROX World Records by age group.\n\nBeyond that, many athletes may consider a \u201cgood\u201d time to simply be better than the average times shown above. However, it\u2019s worth appreciating that some people have been known to take over 3 hours to complete the course. Just turning up and doing your best, when most of the population are at home sat on the sofa, is something to be proud of.\n\nRemember, these times are not set in stone and can vary. The most important thing is to challenge yourself, set personal goals, and aim to continuously improve your own performance with each HYROX event. That is the beauty of HYROX after all \u2013 because the race is the same each time, once you have a time from your first race, you then have a target to beat in your next race. It can become quite addictive!\n\n**Tips for Achieving a Good HYROX Time**\n\nIf you are looking to set a good HYROX time, there are numerous factors to consider. Some key areas to focus on include:\n\n**Training**: Train regularly and specifically for the event. Training for HYROX can sometimes be confusing, as balancing strength demands with endurance demands isn\u2019t always easy. For more information check out this article on HYROX training plan fundamentals.\n\n**Running**: Running is a major part of HYROX, and is something that everyone should be working on. One factor many people get wrong is pacing their running. Check out this article for more info on how to pace your running at HYROX.\n\n**Know the Standards**: There are certain movement standards that will need to be adhered to throughout the race. Failure to do so can result in time penalties or disqualification. For more info check out the HYROX rulebook, as well as our articles on each of the stations in the race; Ski, Sled Push, Sled Pull, Burpee Broad Jump, Row, Farmers Carry, Lunges and Wall Balls.\n\n**Nutrition and Hydration**: Fuelling your body appropriately, and staying well hydrated, is critical throughout your training, and on race day. For more tips on nutrition, check out this article on some of the performance nutrition mistakes I regularly see in HYROX athletes.\n\n**Mental Preparation**: Doing well in HYROX isn\u2019t all just about physical preparation. You need to mentally prepare yourself for the challenge, and push through any mental barriers that may arise. Check out this article on how I use Stoicism to help my sporting performance.\n\n**Avoid Mistakes**: This may be an obvious statement, but you want to avoid some of the common mistakes made during HYROX. The problem is that mistakes are very easily made in the midst of a race. Check out this article on 13 Common HYROX Mistakes and how to avoid them.\n\nIn conclusion, a good HYROX time is subjective and depends on your fitness levels, goals, age group, experience, and division. Whether you are an Elite athlete aiming for the top of the leaderboard, or a beginner just looking to complete the event, HYROX is all about challenging yourself. Train hard, stay motivated, and enjoy the journey towards achieving your own personal best!\n\nIf you would like help in achieving a good finishing time at HYROX, check out our personalised coaching or our 12 week training plan.\n\n",

          "snippet": "## Jump to:\n\nThe increasing popularity of Hyrox means everyone is looking at ways they can improve their time. And with 8km of running and eight different stations interspersed throughout \u2013 not to mention the equally important 'Roxzone' \u2013 there's plenty of opportunities to both make up and lose time over the course of an event.\n\nBut how does your time compare to the average on the SkiErg, sled push or wall balls? Data compiled from both the pro and open divisions allows for simple comparison with your fellow competitors, while an expert currently at the top of the sport has offered his guidance on how to get faster.\n\n## What Is the Average Hyrox Finish Time for Men?\n\nAccording to RoxHype, the average Hyrox finish time across men of all ages in the pro division is 1:22:24 in 2025, with Alexander Roncevic's world record of 53:15 set in Hamburg 2025 blitzing that in remarkable fashion.\n\nWhen it comes to the open division, where weights are lighter and more accessible to men of all ages and abilities, the average finishing time is 1:26:42.\n\n## What Is the Average Time for Each Hyrox Station?\n\nWith Hyrox races featuring eight challenging stations, plus 8km of total running and even time in the Roxzone, there's plenty of variance between the pro and open divisions. These are the average times it takes men to complete all the stations in each division:\n\n## How to Improve Your Hyrox Time\n\nJake Dearden is a world record holder in the pro doubles division, setting a time of 50:04 alongside James Kelly. He also competes individually in the Elite 15. While running accounts for 50% of the race, and has to be a key area of focus for anyone wanting to get quicker, Dearden offers the following tips to improve across the board.\n\n## 1. Pace Yourself\n\nDespite the intense nature of a Hyrox, it epitomises the cliche of being a 'marathon not a sprint'. Yes, you will have plenty of energy as you start your first kilometre run. But no, that doesn't mean you should try and complete it as quickly as possible.\n\n'Think about a race in order of importance, so starting off with your SkiErg [the first workout station] \u2013 that\u2019s the most important exercise,' Dearden notes. 'If your heart rate skyrockets at the ski and you struggle, that\u2019s going to fatigue you for the rest of the race. But if you get fatigued at the burpees [the fourth station], you\u2019ve had a good first half of the race. You need to focus on these things in order of importance, but don\u2019t neglect any of them. If your wall balls really suffer, work on them.'\n\n## 2. Run Fatigued\n\nIt's all well and good being a strong runner, but if you're unable to keep cycling your legs after 100m of sandbag lunges, then you're always going to struggle. 'I always look at the [workout station] and the run as one exercise, so if you\u2019re a strength athlete and you\u2019re amazing at the sled push, look at your sled push and your running time after as one exercise,' Dearden says.\n\n'You might be really good at the sled push, but then your running might drop off a cliff. If you\u2019re a stronger athlete and you\u2019re not very good at running, you need to get better at it. You can\u2019t neglect anything.'\n\n## 3. The 'Roxzone' Is Equally Important\n\nThe area between the running track and the individual stations, the Roxzone offers athletes a chance for a breather \u2013 but try not to lean too far into the transitionary phase it feels like. As Dearden points out, this is a race and the clock never stops, 'from the minute you start to the minute you cross the finish line there's no dead time, so make sure that you are moving at\n\n*all* times'.\n\n## 4. Fuel Properly\n\nCarbohydrates provide essential energy to perform at your best come race day, so don't worry about dieting down just so you have visible abs in the run up to the event. 'Realistically, Hyrox is an endurance event, but it's one where we're working at a really high heart rate for the majority of the race,' Dearden says. 'We're probably working at 80 to 90% of our thresholds throughout, which to be clear, requires carbohydrates'.\n\n## 5. Nothing New on Race Day\n\nFor those of you that have ever run a half or full marathon, this phrase will sound familiar. While this generally relates to keeping your nutrition and hydration the same \u2013 and wearing shoes or clothing that you know will stay comfortable after over an hour of vigorous exercise \u2013 it also means not going much quicker on the SkiErg than you're used to, just because you feel good and the adrenaline is getting the better of you.\n\n'Whatever you do in training, that's what you do on race day,' advises Dearden. 'Don't do anything new. Don't be looking at the person next to you or looking at the elite athletes and copying what they do, because that might not work.'\n\nRyan Dabbs\n\nRyan is a Senior Writer at\n\n*Men\u2019s Health* *UK* with a passion for storytelling, health and fitness.

points in HYROX performance.\n\n## How to Interpret Your HYROX Time\n\nUse these benchmarks to guide your training and goal setting:\n\n**Sub-90 minutes \u2192 above average globally** **Sub-75 minutes \u2192 highly competitive performance** **Sub-60 minutes \u2192 elite international level** **100+ minutes \u2192 common first-race range**\n\nMost first-time competitors finish between\n\n**90 and 120 minutes**, depending on pacing strategy, strength endurance, and race experience.\n\n## How Reliable Are These Benchmarks?\n\nHYROX is one of the few fitness race formats that is fully standardised worldwide. Every event uses:\n\n- identical race structure\n\n- chip timing\n\n- centralised results tracking\n\n- global competition data\n\nThis allows performance comparisons across countries, seasons, and divisions.\n\nBenchmark ranges are informed by:\n\n- Official HYROX competition information and participant averages\n\n- Large international result pools recorded every race season\n\n- Independent statistical analysis of large performance datasets, including studies examining thousands to hundreds of thousands of finish times\n\nThat scale of data makes HYROX performance benchmarks unusually reliable compared to most fitness events.\n\n### HYROX Finish Time Distribution Curve (Percentiles Visualised)\n\nMost HYROX finish times cluster in the middle of the field, with fewer athletes at the very fast (elite) and very slow (beginner) ends. This bell-curve style chart helps you instantly understand where your time likely sits in the overall distribution.\n\n**How to use this:** Find your finish time on the bottom axis, then match it to the coloured band.\n\nThe middle bands represent the biggest share of athletes, while the far-left (Elite) is rare.\n\n#### Enter Your HYROX Time \u2192 Get Your Performance Band\n\n**1:32:30**, enter\n\n**92.5**.\n\n## Average HYROX Times 2026\n\nCompare your own times to the average times set in each division so far in 2026.\n\n### HYROX Average Station Times (Pro vs Open) + Average Finish Time\n\n|Station|HYROX Pro Men|HYROX Pro Women|HYROX Open Men|HYROX Open Women|\n|--|--|--|--|--|\n|SkiErg|04:11|04:48|04:30|05:10|\n|Sled Push|03:40|03:43|03:00|02:45|\n|Sled Pull|05:54|06:05|05:07|05:50|\n|Burpees|04:35|05:22|05:45|07:09|\n|Row|04:29|05:02|04:51|05:24|\n|Farmers Carry|02:02|02:35|02:10|02:16|\n|Lunges|05:08|05:21|05:30|05:26|\n|Wall Balls|06:48|06:41|07:33|07:18|\n|RoxZone Time|05:47|06:42|07:16|08:03|\n|Run Total|35:44|40:36|42:00|48:00|\n|Total Time|1:18:12|1:26:52|1:28:30|1:38:30|\n### HYROX Doubles Average Station Times (Men, Women & Mixed) + Average Finish Time\n\n|Station|HYROX Doubles Men|HYROX Doubles Women|HYROX Doubles Mixed|\n|--|--|--|--|\n|SkiErg|04:00|04:39|04:15|\n|Sled Push|01:47|01:51|02:08|\n|Sled Pull|03:24|04:09|04:03|\n|Burpees|03:16|04:24|03:40|\n|Row|04:28|05:05|04:43|\n|Farmers Carry|01:38|01:52|01:47|\n|Lunges|03:34|03:44|04:07|\n|Wall Balls|04:32|04:32|04:52|\n|RoxZone Time|06:37|07:34|07:09|\n|Run Total|41:14|48:18|45:19|\n|Total Time|1:14:18|1:25:59|1:21:54|\n### HYROX Relay Average Station Times (Men, Women & Mixed Relay) + Average Finish Time\n\n|Station|HYROX Relay Men|HYROX Relay Women|HYROX Mixed Relay|\n|--|--|--|--|\n|SkiErg|06:03|05:22|05:48|\n|Sled Push|02:44|02:32|02:17|\n|Sled Pull|04:54|05:55|04:42|\n|Burpees|04:58|06:10|05:01|\n|Row|04:45|05:18|04:58|\n|Farmers Carry|02:07|02:06|02:02|\n|Lunges|05:00|05:00|04:37|\n|Wall Balls|06:38|05:43|05:42|\n|RoxZone Time|06:38|05:43|05:42|\n|Run Total|35:44|38:13|34:11|\n|Total Time|1:23:06|1:30:50|1:21:33|\n## Understanding HYROX Times\n\nIn every HYROX event, you are equipped with a timing chip that\u2019s worn around your ankle. This chip records your time throughout the competition, and makes sure your performance metrics are accurately captured.\n\nThis information is uploaded to the HYROX ranking page and broken down into the exercise stations and time you took to complete each stage and displayed on the HYROX results page like the image below. You can select elements to narrow down your search such as your division (Pro, Individual, Doubles or Relay), Gender, Age, and Country.\n\nThe timings are displayed in the order that you complete each section in a HYROX as per below;\n\n- 1km Run,\n\n- 1000m Ski Erg,\n\n- 1km Run,\n\n- 4 x 12.5m Sled Push,\n\n- 1km Run,\n\n- 4 x 12.5m Sled Pull,\n\n- 1km Run,\n\n- 80m Burpee Broad Jump,\n\n- 1km Run,\n\n- 1000m Row\n\n- 1km Run,\n\n- 200m Kettlebells Farmers Carry,\n\n- 1km Run,\n\n- 100m Sandbag Lunges,\n\n- 1km Run,\n\n- 100 Wall Balls\n\n**HYROX Rankings Explained**\n\nThe displayed data, taken from the timing chip, includes a breakdown of how you did across the race\u2019s different segments. It allows you to see the duration it took you to complete each part of the event, as well as how your performance ranked against other people globally within your division.\n\nThis feature is great for assessing your performance, identifying areas of strength, and pinpointing the bits you need to focus on and do better in.\n\n## HYROX World Record Breakers\n\n### HYROX Fastest Man World Record\n\n** \u2013 Hamburg 2025Roncevic, Alexander**\n\n00:53:15\n\n### HYROX fastest Woman World Record\n\n**Lauren Weeks** \u2013 Glasgow 2025\n\n00:56.23\n\n### HYROX Fastest Men Pro Doubles World Record\n\n**Rich Ryan, Pelayo Menendez-Fernendez** \u2013 Miami 2025\n\n00:48.31\n\n### HYROX Fastest Men Doubles World Record\n\n**Jake Williamson and Fabi Eisenlauer** \u2013 Berlin 2025\n\n00:47:57\n\n### HYROX Fastest Women Pro Doubles World Record\n\n**Lauren Weeks and Vivian Tafuto** \u2013 Vancouver 2025\n\n00:53.40\n\n### HYROX Fastest Women Doubles World Record\n\n**Meg Martin & Mollie Emond** \u2013 Brisbane 2025\n\n00:54:20\n\n### HYROX Fastest Mixed Doubles World Record\n\n**Cole Learn and Mollie Fkiaras** \u2013 Melbourne 2025\n\n00:49:13\n\n### HYROX Fastest Men Relay World Record\n\n**J\u00f8rgen Olsen, Simen R\u00f8ssland, Kevin Woods, and Kieron White** \u2013 London 2025\n\n00:45:43\n\n### HYROX Fastest Women Relay World Record\n\n**Alexandra Hill, Lauren Stockley, Saskia Geddes, and Allana Falcone**r \u2013 London 2025\n\n00:51:26\n\n### HYROX Fastest Mixed Relay World Record\n\n**Tim Wenisch, Sin\u00e9ad Bent, Charlie Botterill, and Seka Arning** \u2013 Manchester 2026\n\n00:47:12\n\n## Top 10 HYROX Records\n\n### Top 10 HYROX Men Times\n\n### Top 10 HYROX Women Times\n\n### Top 10 HYROX Men Pro Doubles\n\n### Top 10 HYROX Men Doubles Open\n\n### Top 10 HYROX Pro Womens Doubles\n\n### Top 10 HYROX Womens Doubles\n\n### Top 10 HYROX Men Team Relay\n\n### Top 10 HYROX Women Team Relay\n\n### Top 10 HYROX Mixed Team Relay\n\n## Setting Realistic Expectations\n\nIf you\u2019re just starting out, it\u2019s important to you have realistic expectations about your HYROX times. Your finishing time in a HYROX race is influenced by a ton of factors, ranging from your current fitness level, experience in similar events, race day nerves, sleep, nutrition etc, the list goes on. Just finishing your first race can be something to be proud of.\n\n**Fitness Level**\n\nYour physical conditioning plays a huge role in how you tackle the HYROX stations. The more practise your body has in the movements each station requires, the quicker and more efficiently you\u2019ll complete each station.\n\n**Experience**\n\nThere\u2019s no substitute for experience. Veterans of HYROX events, and those with a background in similar endurance and functional fitness competitions, will have a strategic edge.\n\nThey understand how to pace themselves, when to push hard, and how to conserve energy for the later stages of the race.\n\nIf you\u2019re new to HYROX, your initial times will reflect your learning curve, learn to listen to your body and when to ease off or ramp up your effort without burning out.\n\nWhile it\u2019s natural to look up to the crazy course records of Hunter Mcintyre and Lauren Weeks and the unbelievable times they set, it\u2019s important to ground your expectations in your current reality.\n\nThese record times serve as an insight of what\u2019s possible, showcasing the pinnacle of human performance in the HYROX world. Use them to inspire and motivate you to what is possible.\n\nHowever, diving headfirst into your HYROX journey with the expectation of matching or outperforming these elite times can be a recipe for disappointment. Instead, focus on setting personal goals that challenge you yet are attainable based on your fitness level, experience, and familiarity with the course.\n\nCelebrate your own milestones and progress, no matter how little they can seem, compared to the top athletes and make sure you have the right footwear to get you through.\n\nAs you grow in HYROX, gradually increase your performance bar. Over time, with consistent training and experience, you\u2019re gonna surprise yourself with how much you can achieve. Let the exceptional times inspire you, but let your personal progress be your guide and source of pride.\n\n## Training Tips for HYROX\n\nTo smash your race, your HYROX training should be a blend of endurance and strength training. This will make sure you\u2019re as prepared to nail the 8 x 1km runs as you are to glide through the heavy sled push and pulls.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to follow a structured HYROX training plan, focusing equally on building your stamina and bolstering your muscle for the functional challenges.\n\nMastering the art of pacing during the running segments can make or break your race, so absorb tips on finding that sweet spot in your stride that keeps you moving efficiently from start to finish.\n\nIt\u2019s good practise to keep on top of all the ways to improve your fitness outside of HYROX.\n\n## Data Sources and Methodology\n\nPerformance benchmarks and participation patterns are based on:\n\n- Official HYROX competition information and global race timing data\n\n- Standardised international race formats used across all events\n\n- Large-scale participant result pools recorded across multiple seasons\n\n- Independent performance analysis of thousands of race results\n\nPrimary governing authority:\n\n**HYROX official competition data and event timing systems**\n\nThese benchmarks represent real-world performance outcomes across the global HYROX racing population.\n\n## Wrapping Up\n\nSo there you have it, the average times and fastest HYROX times in the world. Use these times to see where you currently sit in each area of your race and work out what sections you need to focus on the most to improve your overall performance.\n\nShaving off a few seconds here and there all adds up and before you know it you could be on the elite rankings!\n\nNow get out there, smash your training and sign up for your next race!\n\n## FAQ\u2019s\n\n### What is a good HYROX time?\n\nA good HYROX time is generally\n\n**under 90 minutes**, which places an athlete above the global average. Times under **75 minutes** are highly competitive, and **sub-60 minutes** represents **elite international performance**.\n\n### What is average HYROX time?\n\nThe\n\n**average HYROX finish time worldwide** is approximately **90 minutes**. This reflects typical performance for **recreational athletes** competing in standard Open divisions.\n\n### What time qualifies for Worlds?\n\n**World Championship qualification times** vary by division and gender, but typically **finishing under 75 minutes** for Open divisions places athletes in contention for the HYROX Worlds.\n\n### Is sub 90 minutes good?\n\nYes. Completing a HYROX race in\n\n**under 90 minutes** is above average and demonstrates **strong overall fitness** compared to the global participant base.\n\n### How long do beginners take?\n\nMost first-time HYROX participants finish between\n\n**90 and 120 minutes**, depending on **experience level, pacing strategy, and workout strengths**.\n\n### What is a respectable HYROX time?\n\nA respectable HYROX time depends on your goals and fitness, but generally:\n\n**Average finishers**complete HYROX in around **1 hr 30 \u2013 1 hr 35 min**. **Above\u2011average/competitive racers**typically finish **under 1 hr 25 min (men)**and **under 1 hr 30 min (women)**.\n\nFor many participants, anything quicker than the average is a strong result.\n\n### What is the fastest time for the HYROX?\n\nThe\n\n**world\u2019s fastest recorded HYROX times** in the Pro Individual division: **Men:**around **53 min 22 sec**. **Women:**around **58 min 03 sec**.\n\nThese represent elite performances on a global level.\n\n### How fast should you run 1K in HYROX?\n\nYour 1 km running pace in HYROX varies by ability:\n\n**Elite/Pro:**roughly **4:00 \u2013 4:30 / km**average across the 8 runs. **Good competitive level:**around **5:00 \u2013 5:30 / km**. **Novice/average:** **6:00 / km or slower**is typical for those newer to the sport.\n\nBecause HYROX includes eight 1 km runs mixed with functional stations, consistency and pacing are as important as outright speed.\n\nWhat is the average time for the men\u2019s HYROX race?\n\nThe average finish time for men in a HYROX race typically falls around 90 minutes. However, times can vary based on the fitness level and experience of the participants.\n\n### What is a good row time for HYROX?\n\nA competitive rowing time in HYROX for the 1km rowing segment is approximately 3 to 4 minutes for both men and women. Achieving a time in this range shows a strong performance. Rowing is great for improving fitness.\n\n### What HYROX Events are there in 2026?\n\nThe following events have been confirmed in 2026;\n\nHYROX Turin \u2013 30.01.26 \u2013 01.02.26\n\nHYROX Vienna \u2013 06.02.26 \u2013 08.02.26\n\nHYROX Guadalajara \u2013 07.02.26 \u2013 08.02.26\n\nHYROX Bilbao \u2013 07.02.26 \u2013 08.02.26\n\nHYROX Nice \u2013 12.02.26 \u2013 15.02.26\n\nHYROX Istanbul \u2013 13.02.26 \u2013 14.02.26\n\nHYROX Las Vegas \u2013 20.02.26 \u2013 22.02.26\n\nHYROX Katowice \u2013 21.02.26 \u2013 22.02.26\n\nHYROX Taipei \u2013 28.02.26 \u2013 01.03.26\n\nHYROX Fortaleza \u2013 28.02.26\n\nHYROX Washington D.C.
