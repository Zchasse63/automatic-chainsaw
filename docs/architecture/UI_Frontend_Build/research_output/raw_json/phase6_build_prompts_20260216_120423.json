Since the previous beta release, we added several new features and improvements:\n\n\u2026\n\nFor reminder, those features were available since the previous beta release:\n\n**Turbopack (stable)**: Default bundler for all apps with up to 5-10x faster Fast Refresh, and 2-5x faster builds **Turbopack File System Caching (beta)**: Even faster startup and compile times for the largest apps **React Compiler Support (stable)**: Built-in integration for automatic memoization **Build Adapters API (alpha)**: Create custom adapters to modify the build process **Enhanced Routing**: Optimized navigations and prefetching with layout deduplication and incremental prefetching **Improved Caching APIs**: New\n\n\u2026\n\n```\n\n\u25b2 Next.js 16 (Turbopack)\n\n\u2713 Compiled successfully in 615ms\n\n\u2713 Finished TypeScript in 1114ms\n\n\u2713 Collecting page data in 208ms\n\n\u2713 Generating static pages in 239ms\n\n\u2713 Finalizing page optimization in 5ms\n\n```\n\nThe following features were previously announced in the beta release:\n\n\u2026\n\n### Breaking Changes and Other Updates\n\n#### Version Requirements\n\n|Change|Details|\n|--|--|\n|Node.js 20.9+|Minimum version now 20.9.0 (LTS); Node.js 18 no longer supported|\n|TypeScript 5+|Minimum version now 5.1.0|\n|Browsers|Chrome 111+, Edge 111+, Firefox 111+, Safari 16.4+|\n\n\u2026\n\n#### Behavior Changes\n\nThese features have new default behaviors in Next.js 16:\n\n|Changed Behavior|Details|\n|--|--|\n|Default bundler|Turbopack is now the default bundler for all apps; opt out with `next build --webpack`|\n|`images.minimumCacheTTL` default|Changed from 60s to 4 hours (14400s); reduces revalidation cost for images without cache-control headers|\n\n\u2026\n\n|Terminal output|Redesigned with clearer formatting, better error messages, and improved performance metrics|\n|Dev and build output directories|`next dev` and `next build` now use separate output directories, enabling concurrent execution|\n|Lockfile behavior|Added lockfile mechanism to prevent multiple `next dev` or `next build` instances on the same project|\n|Parallel routes `default.js`|All parallel route slots now require explicit `default.js` files; builds fail without them. Create `default.js` that calls `notFound()` or returns `null` for previous behavior|\n|Modern Sass API|Bumped `sass-loader` to v16, which supports modern Sass syntax and new features|",

How to customize, add plugins and other options with the new CSS-first configuration.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Transcript\n\n{ts:1} as many of you have already noticed with Tailwind CSS version 4 there is no\n{ts:5} Tailwind doc config.js file anymore instead you can now configure all your customizations directly in the CSS file\n{ts:14} according to the creator of tawin CSS this is one of the biggest changes with version 4 so it's very likely that it\n{ts:21} will affect you and that you need to learn about this new CSS first approach if you want to keep using telwin CSS in\n{ts:28} the future in previous versions of Tailwind the Tailwind doc config.js file was where\n{ts:36} you handled all configurations for most projects this file probably looked something like this with a Content\n{ts:42} section where you list all your content files a theme section for customization as well as a plugin section for\n{ts:50} importing your plugins and maybe also some options like dark modes and prefix but since the Tailwind doc\n{ts:57} config.js file was removed with the release of version 4 at least by default here's what you need to know and how\n{ts:64} things work with the new version I'll cover the four main or most common sections of the Tailwind doc config.js\n{ts:71} file and I'll talk about the theme section last because it's the most extensive\n{ts:78} part so let's start with the content section this is where you used to configure the path to all of your HTML\n{ts:85} templates JavaScript components and any other files that contain tail Tailwind class names but with Tailwind version 4\n{ts:93} this is now fully automated that means that Tailwind detects all of this automatically so you no longer need to\n{ts:99} configure it yourself the plugins section in tailent version three this section allows you to\n\n\u2026\n\n{ts:132} version 3 the CLI configures everything for you and if you check your Tailwind doc config.js file afterward you'll see\n{ts:140} that the necessary Imports were added automatically like this line here for example or that\n{ts:148} line but but in Tailwind version 4 plug-in Imports now work differently instead of adding them to the Tailwind\n{ts:155} doc config.js file you now import plugins directly in your Global CSS file in my case that's the index.css and you\n{ts:164} can do that by adding the following line at the top of this file add plugin and then for example DAC UI like that of\n{ts:175} course you still need to install Daisy UI first for this to work and and also make sure that you use the latest\n\n\u2026\n\n{ts:255} instead you now also configure them directly in your CSS file you just need to add The Following\n{ts:262} part at the very top where you import Tailwind CSS you have to say prefix and in here here you say for\n{ts:271} example tww like that one major change here previously many uses prefix classes with\n{ts:280} tww Dash like I just showed you but this is no longer possible with version 4 now prefixes must be separated by a column\n{ts:290} that means in my example the prefix is tww so I have to add this prefix followed by a column to all my Tailwind\n{ts:299} class names in this project like that and now let's move on to the theme\n\n\u2026\n\n{ts:334} the only break points available in this project if you use the colors key here it will completely replace\n{ts:342} Tailwinds default color palette for this project so make sure that you only use keys outside the extend section if you\n{ts:350} know exactly what you need for your project most of the time you probably just want to extend Tailwinds buil-in\n{ts:360} Styles or override just a specific color or font size and for that you can use the extend section down here with this\n{ts:369} part here we add the color Twitter blue but without affecting the default color\n{ts:378} palette so we're simply adding a new color and with this part here we override the color option orange\n{ts:386} 500 but again This only affects this specific shade not the entire color palette because we Define it inside the\n{ts:395} extend section in version four all of this customization now goes into a global CSS\n{ts:401} file so let me show you how to achieve the same customization with the new Tailwind version for that we navigate\n{ts:408} into the top level CSS file index. CSS this has to be the same file where we also import Tailwind\n{ts:416} CSS and in here we can now add the a theme directive with the theme directive we\n{ts:424} Define special CSS variables that are also called theme variables and in here we can now add D- breakpoint\n{ts:433} DSM copy this line two times change this to MD for medium and LG for large then we copy the values from the project with\n{ts:443} Tailwind version three into the project with Tailwind version 4\n{ts:451} and save and since the theme directive kind of works like the extend section in the Tailwind doc config.js file we just\n\n\u2026\n\n{ts:487} get the same results as we get with the screens key in the Tailwind version 3 project so this now brings the same\n{ts:496} results as that next we also want to achieve this and that's also pretty easy if you want\n{ts:506} to add a color like Twitter blue in version 4 you just have to add D- color- Twitter blue and then add the hex\n{ts:520} code like so and if you want to overwrite a specific color option just add D- color Das let's say orange 500\n{ts:529} and again add the hex code like that and that's it so basically if you create a variable in\n{ts:537} here and the name is already taken you overwrite the value of it and if the name is not taken you create a new theme",

          "snippet": "Just three days ago, Tailwind CSS released v4.0 which introduces major changes to how we configure and manage design tokens with this framework.\n\nAs someone who uses Tailwind CSS extensively for both personal and professional work, I immediately migrated my personal website to test the new system.\n\nIn this post, I\u2019ll share my experience migrating to TailwindCSS v4, focusing on the new\n\n`@theme` directive and how it simplifies design token management. You\u2019ll see how the new approach eliminates the need for a separate JavaScript configuration file and makes working with CSS variables more straightforward.\n\n\u2026\n\n## The Old Way to Configure Tailwind CSS With CSS Variables#\n\nPrevious versions of Tailwind CSS have supported a clunky setup for integrating CSS variables. All config settings have to be kept in a JavaScript (JS) config file\n\n`tailwind.config.mjs` found in the project\u2019s root directory.\n\nFor instance, I typically define CSS variables for a custom color palette like this one below:\n\n\u2026\n\nA common way to integrate these in the Tailwind CSS system has been to set up the JS config file like so:\n\n```\n\nexport default {\n\ncontent: [\"./src/**/*.{astro,html,js,jsx,md,mdx,svelte,ts,tsx,vue}\"],\n\ntheme: {\n\nextend: {\n\ncolors: {\n\nprimary: \"var(--primary-color)\",\n\nlink: \"var(--primary-link-color)\",\n\nline: \"var(--line-color)\",\n\ntag: \"var(--tag-color)\",\n\n},\n\n},\n\n},\n\nplugins: [],\n\n};\n\n```\n\n\u2026\n\n## Introducing the New Config Workflow#\n\nTailwind CSS v4 allows you to configure all of your CSS in a single CSS file, without having to maintain a Javascript config file. Taking the example setup introduced in the last section, this is how it would look in the new system:\n```\n\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n\n@theme {\n\n--color-primary: hsl(49, 100%, 7%);\n\n--color-link: hsl(49, 100%, 7%);\n\n--color-line: hsl(49, 23%, 90%);\n\n--color-tag: hsl(49, 22%, 88%);\n\n\n\n```\nThat\u2019s it! In addition, you no longer need to include the boilerplate found in the old JS config file.\n\nThe tailwind compiler will do the following:\n\n- Add these CSS variables to\n\n`:root`\n\n- Generate utility classes such as\n\n`bg-primary`,\n\n`text-primary`, and\n\n`color-link`.\n\n\u2026\n\n`max-w-large-page`, you\u2019d have to add\n\n`--container-large-page: 2500px;` to your\n\n`@theme`. This would generate the desired utility class\n\n`max-w-large-page` in addition to other classes such as\n\n`min-w-large-page`.\n\nI love this new system because it means I no longer need to context switch between my CSS and JS files when editing design tokens. Everything lives in one CSS file.\n\n## Migration Experience#\n\nAs I refactored my website\u2019s CSS, the migration process itself was surprisingly smooth. Since the new\n\n`@theme` system maps directly to the old configuration approach, I mainly needed to:\n\n- Update my astro config to use the new\n\n`@tailwindcss/vite`plugin. Here\u2019s the official guide on how to do that.\n\n- Move my design tokens from\n\n`tailwind.config.mjs`to my CSS file.\n\n- Update the variable naming to match the new namespace conventions.\n\n- Remove the now-unnecessary JavaScript configuration.",

It contains the registry's name, homepage, and defines all the items present in the registry.\n\nYour registry must have this file (or JSON payload) present at the root of the registry endpoint. The registry endpoint is the URL where your registry is hosted.\n\nThe\n\n`shadcn` CLI will automatically generate this file for you when you run the\n\n`build` command.\n\n## Add a registry.json file\n\nCreate a\n\n`registry.json` file in the root of your project. Your project can be a Next.js, Vite, Vue, Svelte, PHP or any other framework as long as it supports serving JSON over HTTP.\n\nThis\n\n`registry.json` file must conform to the registry schema specification.\n\n## Add a registry item\n\n### Create your component\n\nAdd your first component. Here's an example of a simple\n\n`<HelloWorld />` component:\n\n**Note:** This example places the component in the\n\n`registry/new-york`\n\ndirectory. You can place it anywhere in your project as long as you set the\n\ncorrect path in the\n\n`registry.json` file and you follow the\n\n`registry/[NAME]`\n\ndirectory structure.\n\n### Add your component to the registry\n\nTo add your component to the registry, you need to add your component definition to\n\n`registry.json`.\n\nYou define your registry item by adding a\n\n`name`,\n\n`type`,\n\n`title`,\n\n`description` and\n\n`files`.\n\nFor every file you add, you must specify the\n\n\u2026\n\n## Build your registry\n\n### Install the shadcn CLI\n\n### Add a build script\n\nAdd a\n\n`registry:build` script to your\n\n`package.json` file.\n\n### Run the build script\n\nRun the build script to generate the registry JSON files.\n\n**Note:** By default, the build script will generate the registry JSON files\n\nin\n\n`public/r` e.g\n\n`public/r/hello-world.json`.\n\nYou can change the output directory by passing the\n\n`--output` option. See the shadcn build command for more information.\n\n## Serve your registry\n\nIf you're running your registry on Next.js, you can now serve your registry by running the\n\n`next` server. The command might differ for other frameworks.\n\nYour files will now be served at\n\n`http://localhost:3000/r/[NAME].json` eg.\n\n`http://localhost:3000/r/hello-world.json`.\n\n\u2026\n\n- The following properties are required for the block definition:\n\n`name`,\n\n`description`,\n\n`type`and\n\n`files`.\n\n- It is recommended to add a proper name and description to your registry item. This helps LLMs understand the component and its purpose.\n\n- Make sure to list all registry dependencies in\n`registryDependencies`. A registry dependency is the name of the component in the registry eg.\n\n`input`,\n\n`button`,\n\n`card`, etc or a URL to a registry item eg.\n\n`http://localhost:3000/r/editor.json`.\n\n- Make sure to list all dependencies in\n\n`dependencies`. A dependency is the name of the package in the registry eg.\n`zod`,\n\n`sonner`, etc. To set a version, you can use the\n\n`name@version`format eg.\n\n`zod@^3.20.0`.\n\n**Imports should always use the**eg.\n\n`@/registry`path.\n\n`import { HelloWorld } from \"@/registry/new-york/hello-world/hello-world\"`\n\n- Ideally, place your files within a registry item in\n\n`components`,\n\n`hooks`,\n\n`lib`directories.\n\n## Install using the CLI\n\nTo install a registry item using the\n\n`shadcn` CLI, use the\n\n`add` command followed by the URL of the registry item.\n\nSee the Namespaced Registries docs for more information on how to install registry items from a namespaced registry.\n\nOn This PageRequirementsregistry.jsonAdd a registry.json fileAdd a registry itemCreate your componentAdd your component to the registryBuild your registryInstall the shadcn CLIAdd a build scriptRun the build scriptServe your registryPublish your registryGuidelinesInstall using the CLI",

Not to be confused with the built-in\n\n`onAnimationStart`, which\n\nwould trigger for animations on the\n\n`<NumberFlow>` element itself.\n\n`onAnimationsFinish: (e: CustomEvent) => void`\n\nTriggered when update animations finish.\n\n## Styling\n\nNumberFlow uses a\n\n```\n\nnumber-flow-react::part(suffix) {\n\nmargin-left: .0625em;\n\nfont-weight: normal;\n\nfont-size: 0.75em;\n\ncolor: var(--muted);\n\n\n\n```\n\nYou can use your browser\u2019s inspector to see which\n\n`part` attributes\n\n`font-size` of digits is difficult\n\ndue to the CSS techniques NumberFlow uses.\n\n`::part` styles may cause a flash of unstyled content in\n\n## See workaround\n\nYou can use feature detection\n\nto apply\n\n`::part` styles only to browsers that support\n\n`<head>`:\n\n```\n\n<script>\n\nif (\n\nHTMLTemplateElement.prototype.hasOwnProperty('shadowRootMode') ||\n\nHTMLTemplateElement.prototype.hasOwnProperty('shadowRoot') // old Chrome/Edge\n\n\n\ndocument.documentElement.setAttribute('data-supports-dsd', '')\n\n</script>\n\n```\nThen ensure your\n\n`::part` styles use it:\n\n```\n\n:root[data-supports-dsd] number-flow-react::part(suffix) {\n\nfont-size: 0.75rem;\n\n\n\n```\n\nIf you\u2019re using Tailwind, you can do this with a custom variant:\n\n```\n\n// tailwind.config.js\n\nimport plugin from 'tailwindcss/plugin'\n\nexport default {\n\n// ...\n\nplugins: [\n\nplugin(({ matchVariant }) => {\n\nmatchVariant('part', (p) => `:root[data-supports-dsd] &::part(${p})`)\n\n})\n\n\n\n```\n`<NumberFlow className=\"part-[suffix]:text-xs\" />`\n\nThere\u2019s also some CSS properties you can use to style the component:\n\n`--number-flow-mask-[height|width]: <length>`\n\nThese adjust the height and width of the gradient fade-out masks at the edges of the number.\n\n`--number-flow-mask-height` also gets used as the top and bottom padding for the number.\n`--number-flow-char-height: <length>`\n\nSets the height of each character. This can be used to adjust the spacing between digits during spin animations.\n\n`font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`\n\nEnsures all numbers are the same width, which can prevent digits from shifting during transitions.\n\nSee\n\n## Grouping\n\nIf a\n\n`<NumberFlow>` affects another\n\n`<NumberFlow>`\u2018s position, you can wrap them in a\n\n`<NumberFlowGroup>` to properly sync their transitions:\n```\n\nimport NumberFlow, { NumberFlowGroup } from '@number-flow/react'\n\nimport clsx from 'clsx/lite'\n\ntype Props = {\n\nvalue: number\n\ndiff: number\n\n\n\nexport default function PriceWithDiff({ value, diff }: Props) {\n\nreturn (\n\n<NumberFlowGroup>\n\n<div\n\nstyle={{ '--number-flow-char-height': '0.85em' }}\nclassName=\"flex items-center gap-4 font-semibold\"\n\n\n\n<NumberFlow\n\nvalue={value}\n\nlocales=\"en-US\"\n\nformat={{ style: 'currency', currency: 'USD' }}\n\nclassName=\"~text-2xl/4xl\"\n\n/>\n\n<NumberFlow\n\nvalue={diff}\n\nlocales=\"en-US\"\nformat={{ style: 'percent', maximumFractionDigits: 2, signDisplay: 'always' }}\n\nclassName={clsx(\n\n'~text-lg/2xl transition-colors duration-300',\n\ndiff < 0 ?

          "snippet": "## registry.json\n\nThe\n\n`registry.json` file is only required if you're using the\n\n`shadcn` CLI to build your registry.\n\nIf you're using a different build system, you can skip this step as long as your build system produces valid JSON files that conform to the registry-item schema specification.\n\n### Add a registry.json file\n\nCreate a\n\n`registry.json` file in the root of your project. Your project can be a Next.js, Remix, Vite, or any other project that supports React.\n\n```\n\n\n\n\"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema/registry.json\",\n\n\"name\": \"acme\",\n\n\"homepage\": \"https://acme.com\",\n\n\"items\": [\n\n// ...\n\n\n\n```\n\nThis\n\n`registry.json` file must conform to the registry schema specification.\n\n## Add a registry item\n\n### Create your component\n\nAdd your first component. Here's an example of a simple\n\n`<HelloWorld />` component:\n\n```\n\nimport { Button } from \"@/components/ui/button\"\n\nexport function HelloWorld() {\n\nreturn <Button>Hello World</Button>\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Note:** This example places the component in the\n\n`registry/new-york`\n\n\u2026\n\n### Add your component to the registry\n\nTo add your component to the registry, you need to add your component definition to\n\n`registry.json`.\n\n```\n\n\n\n\"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema/registry.json\",\n\n\"name\": \"acme\",\n\n\"homepage\": \"https://acme.com\",\n\n\"items\": [\n\n\n\n\"name\": \"hello-world\",\n\n\"type\": \"registry:block\",\n\n\"title\": \"Hello World\",\n\n\"description\": \"A simple hello world component.\",\n\n\"files\": [\n\n\n\n\"path\": \"registry/new-york/hello-world/hello-world.tsx\",\n\n\"type\": \"registry:component\"\n\n\n\n```\nYou define your registry item by adding a\n\n`name`,\n\n`type`,\n\n`title`,\n\n`description` and\n\n`files`.\n\nFor every file you add, you must specify the\n\n`path` and\n\n`type` of the file. The\n\n`path` is the relative path to the file from the root of your project. The\n\n`type` is the type of the file.\n\nYou can read more about the registry item schema and file types in the registry item schema docs.\n\n## Build your registry\n\n### Install the shadcn CLI\n\nNote: the\n\n`build` command is currently only available in the\n\n`shadcn@canary` version of the CLI.\n\n```\n\npnpm add shadcn@canary\n\n```\n\n### Add a build script\n\nAdd a\n\n`registry:build` script to your\n\n`package.json` file.\n\n```\n\n\n\n\"scripts\": {\n\n\"registry:build\": \"shadcn build\"\n\n\n\n```\n\n### Run the build script\n\nRun the build script to generate the registry JSON files.\n\n```\n\npnpm registry:build\n\n```\n\n**Note:** By default, the build script will generate the registry JSON files\n\nin\n\n`public/r` e.g\n\n`public/r/hello-world.json`.\n\nYou can change the output directory by passing the\n\n`--output` option. See the shadcn build command for more information.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Adding Auth\n\nThe\n\n`shadcn` CLI does not offer a built-in way to add auth to your registry. We recommend handling authorization on your registry server.\n\nA common simple approach is to use a\n\n`token` query parameter to authenticate requests to your registry. e.g.\n\n`http://localhost:3000/r/hello-world.json?token=[SECURE_TOKEN_HERE]`.\n\n\u2026\n\n- The following properties are required for the block definition:\n\n`name`,\n\n`description`,\n\n`type`and\n\n`files`.\n\n- Make sure to list all registry dependencies in\n\n`registryDependencies`. A registry dependency is the name of the component in the registry eg.\n\n`input`,\n\n`button`,\n\n`card`, etc or a URL to a registry item eg.\n`http://localhost:3000/r/editor.json`.\n\n- Make sure to list all dependencies in\n\n`dependencies`. A dependency is the name of the package in the registry eg.\n\n`zod`,\n\n`sonner`, etc. To set a version, you can use the\n\n`name@version`format eg.\n`zod@^3.20.0`.\n\n**Imports should always use the**eg.\n\n`@/registry`path.\n\n`import { HelloWorld } from \"@/registry/new-york/hello-world/hello-world\"`\n\n- Ideally, place your files within a registry item in\n\n`components`,\n\n`hooks`,\n\n`lib`directories.\n\n## Install using the CLI\n\nTo install a registry item using the\n\n`shadcn` CLI, use the\n\n`add` command followed by the URL of the registry item.\n\n```\n\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add http://localhost:3000/r/hello-world.json\n\n```\n\nOn This Page\n\n- registry.json\n\n- Add a registry item\n\n- Build your registry\n\n- Serve your registry\n\n- Publish your registry\n\n- Adding Auth\n\n- Guidelines\n\n- Install using the CLI",

If you're using the copy and paste method, you don't need this file.\n\nYou can create a components.json file in your project by running the following command:\n\nThen, you'll need to add this to your\n\n`components.json` to allow kokonutUI registry.\n\n### 2. Install utilities\n\nAll components use Tailwind CSS v4, so ensure it's installed in your project.\n\nMany components also use the\n\n`cn` utility function\u2014install it with the following command:\n\n### 3. That's it \ud83c\udf89\n\nWe use lucide-icons for most components that include icons, along with some shadcn/ui components.

          "snippet": "Creating a Supabase client for SSR\n\nConfigure your Supabase client to use cookies\n\nTo use Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Supabase, you need to configure your Supabase client to use cookies. The\n\n`@supabase/ssr` package helps you do this for JavaScript/TypeScript applications.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall the\n\n`@supabase/supabase-js` and\n\n`@supabase/ssr` helper packages:\n\n`1npm install @supabase/supabase-js @supabase/ssr`\n\n## Set environment variables\n\nCreate a\n\n`.env.local` file in the project root directory. In the file, set the project's Supabase URL and Key:\n\n###### Project URL\n\n###### Publishable key\n\n###### Anon key\n\nYou can also get the Project URL and key from the project's\n\n**Connect** dialog.\n\n##### Changes to API keys\n\nSupabase is changing the way keys work to improve project security and developer experience. You can read the full announcement, but in the transition period, you can use both the current\n\n`anon` and\n\n`service_role` keys and the new publishable key with the form\n\n`sb_publishable_xxx` which will replace the older keys.\n\nIn most cases, you can get the correct key from the Project's\n\n**Connect** dialog, but if you want a specific key, you can find all keys in the API Keys section of a Project's Settings page: **For legacy keys**, copy the\n\n`anon`key for client-side operations and the\n\n`service_role`key for server-side operations from the\n\n**Legacy API Keys**tab. **For new keys**, open the **API Keys**tab, if you don't have a publishable key already, click **Create new API Keys**, and copy the value from the **Publishable key**section.\n\nRead the API keys docs for a full explanation of all key types and their uses.\n\n`1NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=supabase_project_url2NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=supabase_publishable_key`\n\n## Create a client\n\nYou need setup code to configure a Supabase client to use cookies. Once you have the utility code, you can use the\n\n`createClient` utility functions to get a properly configured Supabase client.\n\nUse the browser client in code that runs on the browser, and the server client in code that runs on the server.\n\n### Write utility functions to create Supabase clients\n\nTo access Supabase from a Next.js app, you need 2 types of Supabase clients:\n\n**Client Component client**- To access Supabase from Client Components, which run in the browser. **Server Component client**- To access Supabase from Server Components, Server Actions, and Route Handlers, which run only on the server.\n\nSince Next.js Server Components can't write cookies, you need a Proxy to refresh expired Auth tokens and store them.\n\nThe Proxy is responsible for:\n\n- Refreshing the Auth token by calling\n\n`supabase.auth.getClaims()`.\n\n- Passing the refreshed Auth token to Server Components, so they don't attempt to refresh the same token themselves. This is accomplished with\n\n`request.cookies.set`.\n\n- Passing the refreshed Auth token to the browser, so it replaces the old token. This is accomplished with\n\n`response.cookies.set`.\n\nCreate a\n\n`lib/supabase` folder at the root of your project, or inside the\n\n`./src` folder if you are using one, with a file for each type of client. Then copy the lib utility functions for each client type.\n\nView source\n\n`1import { createBrowserClient } from '@supabase/ssr'23export function createClient() {4 return createBrowserClient(5 process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,6 process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY!7 )8}`\n\n### Hook up proxy\n\nThe code adds a matcher so the Proxy doesn't run on routes that don't access Supabase.\n\nBe careful when protecting pages. The server gets the user session from the cookies, which can be spoofed by anyone.\n\nAlways use\n\n`supabase.auth.getClaims()` to protect pages and user data.\n\n*Never* trust\n\n`supabase.auth.getSession()` inside server code such as Proxy. It isn't guaranteed to revalidate the Auth token.\n\nIt's safe to trust\n\n`getClaims()` because it validates the JWT signature against the project's published public keys every time.\n\nView source\n\n`1import { type NextRequest } from \"next/server\"2import { updateSession } from \"@/lib/supabase/proxy\"34export async function proxy(request: NextRequest) {5 return await updateSession(request)6}78export const config = {9 matcher: [10 /*11 * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:12 * - _next/static (static files)13 * - _next/image (image optimization files)14 * - favicon.ico (favicon file)15 * Feel free to modify this pattern to include more paths.16 */17 \"/((?!_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|.*\\\\.(?:svg|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|webp)$).*)\",18 ],19}`\n\n## Congratulations\n\nYou're done! To recap, you've successfully:\n\n- Called Supabase from a Server Action.\n\n- Called Supabase from a Server Component.\n\n- Set up a Supabase client utility to call Supabase from a Client Component. You can use this if you need to call Supabase from a Client Component, for example to set up a realtime subscription.\n\n- Set up Proxy to automatically refresh the Supabase Auth session.\n\nYou can now use any Supabase features from your client or server code!\n\n## Next steps\n\n- Implement Authentication using Email and Password\n\n- Implement Authentication using OAuth\n\n- Learn more about SSR\n\n",

Looking forward to what the future of recharts looks like in 3.x and beyond!\n\n**More details and the 3.0 migration guide**\n\n### BREAKING CHANGES\n\nPlease see https://github.com/recharts/recharts/wiki/3.0-migration-guide#breaking-code-changes\n\ntldr;\n\n- ```\n  CategoricalChartState\n  ```\n  (which was access to recharts internal state) no longer exists in event handlers or\n  ```\n  Customized\n  ```\n  , etc.\n- ```\n  <Customized />\n  ```\n  no longer receives recharts state/props\n- Removal of internal props that were always supposed to only be internal to recharts\n- Remove previously deprecated props\n- ...see full list linked above\n\n### New Features\n- Custom Components - you can now render any react component in the recharts tree structure (but it must still be renderable within an SVG). Previously this was controlled and filtered by recharts\n- Tooltip Portals - you can now use portals to position your tooltip data anywhere you'd like, including outside of your chart\n- Legend Portals - similar to the above, you can now use portals to position your Legend anywhere you'd like, including outside of your chart\n- Accessible by default -\n  ```\n  accessibilityLayer\n  ```\n  is now on on all polar and cartesian charts by default. Tab into the chart and use the arrow keys to navigate.\n- Polar charts now support multiple axes (similar to cartesian charts)\n- Tooltip: You can now select which axis your Tooltip belongs to using\n  ```\n  axisId\n  ```\n\n\u2026\n\n### Bug fixes and improvements\n\nThis release fixes some long standing issues in recharts, the easiest way to determine all of them is to take a look at the recharts 3.0 project board\n\n- Animation improvements\n- Typescript improvements\n- Accessibility fixes/improvements\n- ```\n  Pie\n  ```\n  : no more border around pie sectors on click, etc.\n- ```\n  CartesianGrid\n  ```\n  : background now renders below the grid lines instead of above\n- and more!\n\nOur 3.0 storybook has a lot of updated examples!\n\n\u2026\n\n### Fix\n- ```\n  X/YAxis\n  ```\n  : fix issue where recharts class names did not get passed to custom tick components by @MyungAe in #5840\n- ```\n  Bar\n  ```\n  : allow\n  ```\n  minPointSize\n  ```\n  function to receive null and undefined values by @eino in #5947\n- ```\n  TypeScript\n  ```\n  : fix issue which caused build errors when\n  ```\n  allowSyntheticDefaultImports: false\n  ```\n  by @tfaller in #5810\n\n\u2026\n\n## What's Changed\n\nOk, this for sure the last beta release before 3.0! All blockers for 3.0 resolved - will release 3.0 within the next week.\n\n### Changes since beta 1\n\n#### Feat\n- ```\n  X/YAxis\n  ```\n  : add\n  ```\n  symlog\n  ```\n  scale type by @ckifer in #5911\n- ```\n  YAxis\n  ```\n  : Adjust Y axis width automatically with\n  ```\n  width=\"auto\"\n  ```\n  by @saurabhraj123 in #5880\n- ```\n  Bar\n  ```\n  : allow\n  ```\n  minPointSize\n  ```\n  function to receive null and undefined values by @eino in #5947\n\n\u2026\n\n- Inline\n  ```\n  react-smooth\n  ```\n  by @PavelVanecek in #5924 - We moved\n   ```\n  react-smooth\n  ```\n  into the recharts repository and refactored it to TypeScript for easier maintainability and testability\n\nWe've also updated our branch names!\n- ```\n  master\n  ```\n  ->\n  ```\n  2.x\n  ```\n- ```\n  3.x\n  ```\n  ->\n  ```\n  main\n  ```",

Main principles of Recharts are:\n\n**Simply**deploy with React components. **Native**SVG support, lightweight depending only on some D3 submodules. **Declarative**components, components of charts are purely presentational.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n\n<LineChart width={400} height={400} data={data} margin={{ top: 5, right: 20, left: 10, bottom: 5 }}>\n\n<XAxis dataKey=\"name\" />\n\n<Tooltip />\n\n<CartesianGrid stroke=\"#f5f5f5\" />\n\n<Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"uv\" stroke=\"#ff7300\" yAxisId={0} />\n\n<Line type=\"monotone\" dataKey=\"pv\" stroke=\"#387908\" yAxisId={1} />\n\n</LineChart>\n\n```\n\n\u2026\n\n## Releases\n\nReleases are automated via GH Actions - when a new release is created in GH, CI will trigger that:\n\n- Runs a build\n\n- Runs tests\n\n- Runs\n\n`npm publish`\n\nVersion increments and tagging are not automated at this time.\n\n### Release testing\n\nUntil we can automate more, it should be preferred to test as close to the results of\n\n`npm publish` as we possibly can. This ensures we don't publish unintended breaking changes. One way to do that is using\n\n`yalc` -\n\n`npm i -g yalc`.\n\n- Make your changes in recharts\n\n`yalc publish`in recharts\n\n`yalc add recharts`in your test package (ex: in a vite or webpack reach app with recharts installed, imported, and your recent changes used)\n\n`npm install`\n\n- Test a local run, a build, etc.\n\n\u2026\n\n10 months ago3.0.0-alpha.3\n\n10 months ago3.0.0-alpha.2\n\n10 months ago3.0.0-alpha.5\n\n9 months ago3.0.0-alpha.4\n\n9 months ago2.15.0\n\n11 months ago2.15.1\n\n\u2026\n\n2 years ago2.4.1\n\n3 years ago2.4.0\n\n3 years ago2.4.3\n\n3 years ago2.4.2\n\n3 years ago2.6.1\n\n2 years ago2.6.0\n\n2 years ago2.6.2\n\n2 years ago2.5.0\n\n\u2026\n\n4 years ago2.1.0\n\n4 years ago2.0.10\n\n4 years ago2.0.9\n\n5 years ago2.0.8\n\n5 years ago2.0.7\n\n5 years ago2.0.5\n\n5 years ago2.0.6\n\n5 years ago2.0.4",

When using the CDN version, it is exposed as a\n\n`confetti` function on\n\n`window`.\n\n`confetti` takes a single optional object.

When promises are not available (like in IE), it will return\n\n\u2026\n\n`confetti` multiple times before it is done, it will return the same promise every time. Internally, the same canvas element will be reused, continuing the existing animation with the new confetti added. The promise returned by each call to\n\n`confetti` will resolve once all animations are done.\n\nThe\n\n`confetti` parameter is a single optional\n\n\u2026\n\n`square`,\n\n`circle`, and\n\n`star`. The default is to use both squares and circles in an even mix. To use a single shape, you can provide just one shape in the array, such as\n\n`['star']`. You can also change the mix by providing a value such as\n\n`['circle', 'circle', 'square']`to use two third circles and one third squares. You can also create your own shapes using the\n\n\u2026\n\n- For best forward compatibility, it is best to re-generate and re-cache the matrix if you update the\n\n`canvas-confetti`library.\n\n- Support for path-based confetti is limited to browsers which support\n\n`Path2D`, which should really be all major browser at this point.\n\nThis method will return a\n\n\u2026\n\n`confetti` function that uses a custom canvas. This is useful if you want to limit the area on your page in which confetti appear. By default, this method will not modify the canvas in any way (other than drawing to it).\n*Canvas can be misunderstood a bit though, so let me explain why you might want to let the module modify the canvas just a bit. By default, a canvas is a relatively small image -- somewhere around 300x150, depending on the browser. When you resize it using CSS, this sets the display size of the canvas, but not the image being represented on that canvas.\nThink of it as loading a 300x150 jpeg image in an img tag and then setting the CSS for that tag to 1500x600 -- your image will end up stretched and blurry. In the case of a canvas, you need to also set the width and height of the canvas image itself. If you don't want to do that, you can allow confetti to set it for you.*\nNote also that you should persist the custom instance and avoid initializing an instance of confetti with the same canvas element more than once.\n\nThe following global options are available:\n\n\n\n`resize`\n\n*Boolean (default: false)*: Whether to allow setting the canvas image size, as well as keep it correctly sized if the window changes size (e.g. resizing the window, rotating a mobile device, etc.).

In the demo version, you can play with the settings and see examples.\n\n## Installation\n\nnpm i react-canvas-confetti\n\n\u2757 It is expected that the react is already installed as peer dependency.\n\n## Usage\n\nI recommend that you first familiarize yourself with the canvas-confetti library to better understand exactly how this module works.\n\nThere are two ways to use this module:\n\n- Working with Presets (recommended)\n\n- Working with the canvas-confetti library instance directly\n\n### Working with Presets\n\nA preset is an animation template that is already ready to use. Presets allow you to customize animation settings, but do not allow you to change the animation algorithm. Using presets is an easier way to work with the module.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Working with the canvas-confetti instance\n\nWorking with an instance is working with the module at a lower level. This is a more powerful approach that allows you to create your own animation algorithms, but requires more effort.\n\n#### Canvas-confetti instance\n\nConfetti object, which will be received as a result of calling the function create. Gives you full control to create your own animations. Confetti can be accessed in the\n\n`onInit` callback. The interface can be viewed here\n\n\u2026\n\n|className|string|value to set className to canvas element|\n|style|CSSProperties|value to set style to canvas element. If `style` and `className` are not passed, the default styles will be set|\n|globalOptions|TGlobalOptions|global animation settings that cannot be changed after initialization (details)|\n|onInit|(params: {confetti: TCanvasConfettiInstance}) => void|the callback is called when the component is mounted on the page and allows you to access confetti instance (details) for manual animation creation|",

          "snippet": "In July 2022, Tanner Linsley, creator of TanStack, announced the release of TanStack Table, which offers a major upgrade from React Table v7. TanStack Table v8 was completely rewritten in TypeScript to be more performant and feature-rich, while also expanding support to frameworks like Vue, Solid, and Svelte.\nThe react-table NPM package is no longer stable or maintained. The new version is published under the\n\n**@tanstack** scope, with the **@tanstack/react-table** adapter handling React-specific state management and rendering.\n\n**Editor\u2019s note**: This article was last updated by Saleh Mubashar in March 2025 to explain TanStack Table\u2019s emergence over the now-outdated React Table, and provide a direct comparison between TanStack Table, Material React Table, and Material UI table.\n\n\u2026\n\nnpm uninstall react-table @types/react-table npm install @tanstack/react-table\n\nNext, rename all instances of\n\n`useTable` to\n\n`useReactTable` and update the syntax where needed. Table options like\n\n`disableSortBy` have been renamed to\n\n`enableSorting`. Column definitions now use\n\n`accessorKey` for strings and\n`accessorFn` for functions, while\n\n`Header` has been renamed to\n\n`header`.\n\nMarkup changes include replacing\n\n`cell.render('Cell')` with\n\n`flexRender()`, manually defining props like\n\n`colSpan` and\n\n`key`, and using\n\n`getValue()` instead of\n\n`value` for cell rendering. Column definitions have been reorganized, and custom filters now return a boolean instead of filtering rows directly. Overall, the migration requires minor adjustments, but the core concept and functionality remain the same.\nIf you are starting from scratch, the installation process is quite straightforward. Install the TanStack Table adapter for React using the following command:\n\nnpm install @tanstack/react-table\n\nThe\n\n`@tanstack/react-table` adapter is a wrapper around the core table logic. It will provide a number of Hooks and types to manage the table state. The package works with React 16.8 and later, including React 19 (though compatibility with the upcoming React Compiler may change in future updates).\n\n\u2026\n\nNow, we use\n\n`useReactTable` to manage the table\u2019s data and structure.\n\nexport default function App() { const table = useReactTable({ data, columns, getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel(), }); return ( <div> <table> <thead> {table.getHeaderGroups().map((headerGroup) => ( <tr key={headerGroup.id}> {headerGroup.headers.map\n\n\u2026\n\nimport { useEffect, useState } from \"react\"; import axios from \"axios\"; import \"./App.css\"; function App() { const [data, setData] = useState([]); const fetchData = async () => { try { const response = await axios.get(\"https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=snow\"); setData(response.data); } catch (error) { console.error(\"Error fetching data:\", error); } }; useEffect(() => { fetchData(); }, []); return <></>; } export default App;\n\n\u2026\n\n// src/Table.tsx //extra code removed for brevity.. import { flexRender, getCoreRowModel, GroupColumnDef, useReactTable, } from \"@tanstack/react-table\"; export default function Table({ columns, data }: TableProps<Show>) { //use the useReact table Hook to build our\n\n\u2026\n\n`getHeaderGroups` function, and the table body\u2019s rows will be generated via the\n\n`getRowModel()` function.\n\nYou\u2019ll also notice that the\n\n`genre` field is an array, but React will render it to a comma-separated string in our final output.\n\nIf we run our application at this point, we should get the following output:\n\n\u2026\n\n( <input {...props} value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} /> ); } export default function Table({ columns, data }: TableProps<Show>) { const [globalFilter, setGlobalFilter] = useState(\"\"); const table = useReactTable({ data, columns,\n\n\u2026\n\nimport { ColumnFiltersState } from \"@tanstack/react-table\"; export default function Table({ columns, data }: TableProps<Show>) { const [columnFilters, setColumnFilters] = useState<ColumnFiltersState>([]); const table = useReactTable({ //.... state: { columnFilters, globalFilter, }, onColumnFiltersChange: setColumnFilters, //...\n\n\u2026\n\n// src/Table.tsx import { SortingState, getSortedRowModel } from \"@tanstack/react-table\"; const [sorting, setSorting] = useState<SortingState>([]); const table = useReactTable({ //... getSortedRowModel: getSortedRowModel(), onSortingChange: setSorting,\n\n\u2026\n\n//src/Table.tsx import { GroupingState, getGroupedRowModel, getExpandedRowModel } from \"@tanstack/react-table\"; const [grouping, setGrouping] = useState<GroupingState>([]); const table = useReactTable({ //.. getExpandedRowModel: getExpandedRowModel(),\n\n\u2026\n\n//src/Table.tsx const [columnResizeMode, setColumnResizeMode] = React.useState<ColumnResizeMode>(\"onChange\"); const [columnResizeDirection, setColumnResizeDirection] = React.useState<ColumnResizeDirection>(\"ltr\"); const table = useReactTable({ data, columns, columnResizeMode\n\n\u2026\n\n|Dependencies|Fully independent|Requires Material UI and Emotion as peer dependencies|Requires Material UI|\n|Advanced features|Filtering, sorting, resizing, pinning, reordering, visibility control, grouping, aggregation|Filtering, sorting, resizing, pinning, reordering, grouping, aggregation|Basic table columns with manual customization|\nTanStack Table replaced React Table in July 2022, offering a TypeScript rewrite for better performance and multi-framework support. The\n\n`react-table` package is deprecated, with React-specific features now in\n\n`@tanstack/react-table`.\n\nTanStack Table is a headless table library for building tables and data grids for any JavaScript framework, while Material React Table is a component library built on top of TanStack Table v8\u2019s API.

Just like React Js go to the command line and type npx/npm create next-app which will start installing a new Next Js application on your PC with everything set up for you. To get started, use the following command:\n```\nnpx create-next-app@latest\n\n# Create Next App can be installed via yarn:\nyarn create next-app\n\n# Create Next App can be installed via npm:\nnpm create next-app\n```\n\n### Step 3: Create TypeScript Project\n\nYou can create a TypeScript project with the --ts (--typescript flag):\n\n```\nnpx create-next-app@latest --ts\n# or\nyarn create next-app --typescript\n# or\npnpm create next-app --ts\n```\n\n\u2026\n\n**Example: **This example demonstrate a next js demo app created using the create-next-app command.\n\n```\n\n// Filename - pages/index.tsx\n\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport Link from \"next/link\";\n\nexport default class extends React.Component {\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <div>\n                <h1>\n                \tWelcome!

In the code above, we create a column named\n\n\u2026\n\n_21create or replace function match_documents (_21 query_embedding vector(1536),_21 match_threshold float,_21 match_count int_21)_21returns table (_21 id bigint,_21 content text,_21 similarity float_21)_21language sql stable_21as $$_21 select_21 documents.id,_21 documents.content,_21 1 - (documents.embedding <=> query_embedding) as similarity_21 from documents_21 where documents.embedding <=> query_embedding < 1 - match_threshold_21 order by documents.embedding <=> query_embedding_21 limit match_count;_21$$;\n\n\u2026\n\n### Generating embeddings\n\nLet's use JavaScript to generate embeddings and store them in Postgres:\n_29import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'_29import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from 'openai'_29import { supabaseClient } from './lib/supabase'_29_29async function generateEmbeddings() {_29 const configuration = new Configuration({ apiKey\n\n\u2026\n\nrecommends replacing newlines with spaces for best results_29 const input = document.replace(/\\n/g, ' ')_29_29 const embeddingResponse = await openai.createEmbedding({_29 model: 'text-embedding-ada-002',_29 input,_29 })_29_29 const [{ embedding }] = embeddingResponse.data.data_29_29 // In production we should handle possible errors_29 await supabaseClient.from('documents').insert({_29 content: document,_29 embedding,_29 })_29 }_29}\n\n\u2026\n\n// Search query is passed in request payload_45 const { query } = await req.json()_45_45 // OpenAI recommends replacing newlines with spaces for best results_45 const input = query.replace(/\\n/g, ' ')_45_45 const configuration = new Configuration({ apiKey: '<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY\n>' })_45 const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration)_45_45 // Generate a one-time embedding for the query itself_45 const embeddingResponse = await openai.createEmbedding({_45 model: 'text-embedding-ada-002',_45 input,_45 })_45_45 const [{\nembedding }] = embeddingResponse.data.data_45_45 // In production we should handle possible errors_45 const { data: documents } = await supabaseClient.rpc('match_documents', {_45 query_embedding: embedding,_45 match_threshold: 0.78, // Choose an appropriate threshold for your data_45 match_count: 10, // Choose the number of matches_45 })_45_45 return new Response(JSON.stringify(documents), {_45 headers: { ...corsHeaders, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },_45 })_45})\n\n\u2026\n\n_100_100 // Generate a one-time embedding for the query itself_100 const embeddingResponse = await openai.createEmbedding({_100 model: 'text-embedding-ada-002',_100 input,_100 })_100_100 const [{ embedding }] = embeddingResponse.data.data_100_100 // Fetching whole documents for this simple example.\n_100 //_100 // Ideally for context injection, documents are chunked into_100 // smaller sections at earlier pre-processing/embedding step._100 const { data: documents } = await supabaseClient.rpc('match_documents', {_100 query_embedding: embedding,_100 match_threshold: 0.78, // Choose an\n\n\u2026\n\nmatched documents_100 for (let i = 0; i < documents.length; i++) {_100 const document = documents[i]_100 const content = document.content_100 const encoded = tokenizer.encode(content)_100 tokenCount += encoded.text.length_100_100 // Limit context to max 1500 tokens (configurable\n\n\u2026\n\n`}_100_100 Context sections:_100 ${contextText}_100_100 Question: \"\"\"_100 ${query}_100 \"\"\"_100_100 Answer as markdown (including related code snippets if available):_100 `_100_100 // In production we should handle possible errors_100 const completionResponse = await openai.createCompletion\n({_100 model: 'text-davinci-003',_100 prompt,_100 max_tokens: 512, // Choose the max allowed tokens in completion_100 temperature: 0, // Set to 0 for deterministic results_100 })_100_100 const {_100 id,_100 choices: [{ text }],_100 } = completionResponse.data_100_100 return new Response(JSON.stringify({ id, text }), {_100 headers: { ...corsHeaders, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },_100 })_100})",

Since Supabase Vector is built on pgvector, you can store your embeddings within the same database that holds the rest of your application data. When combined with pgvector's indexing algorithms, vector search remains fast at large scales.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Setup database\n\nFirst head over to https://database.new to provision your Supabase database. This will create a Postgres database on the Supabase cloud platform. Alternatively, you can follow the local development options if you prefer to run your database locally using Docker.\n\nIn the studio, jump to the SQL editor and execute the following SQL to enable pgvector:\n\n\u2026\n\n```\nconst supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseServiceRoleKey, {\n  auth: { persistSession: false },\n});\n```\n\nFrom here we use the\n```\nsupabase\n```\nclient to insert our text and embedding (generated earlier) into the database:\n\n```\nconst { error } = await supabase.from(\"documents\").insert({\n  content: input,\n  embedding,\n});\n```",

Configuration\n\n````markdown\n# Claude Code Build Prompt \u2014 Prompt 1: Project Scaffold & Configuration\n\n## Context Header\n\nYou are building the **Hyrox AI Coach**, a full-featured training application for Hyrox athletes.\n\n**Tech Stack:**\n- **Frontend**: Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4\n- **Components**: Kokonut UI + Kokonut UI Pro + shadcn/ui + Recharts + TanStack Table\n- **Backend**: Next.js API routes + Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, PGVector)\n- **AI**: Fine-tuned Llama 3.3 70B on Nebius (OpenAI-compatible API) + RAG via PGVector\n- **Deployment**: Vercel\n\n**Project path**: `/Users/zach/Desktop/hyrox-ai-coach/`\n\n**DO NOT:**\n- Modify any `knowledge_chunks` table or existing RPC functions (they already exist in production)\n- Use OpenAI for coaching LLM calls (Nebius only; OpenAI is used only for embeddings)\n- Create a `tailwind.config.js` file (Tailwind v4 uses CSS-first configuration via `@theme` in the CSS file)\n\n---\n\n## Task: Initialize the project, install all dependencies, configure everything\n\n### Step 1: Create the Next.js Project\n\n```bash\ncd /Users/zach/Desktop/\nnpx create-next-app@16 hyrox-ai-coach --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias=\"@/*\" --turbopack --use-npm\ncd hyrox-ai-coach\n```\n\n### Step 2: Install All Dependencies\n\nRun these install commands in sequence:\n\n```bash\n# Core UI & Animation\nnpm install motion @number-flow/react canvas-confetti react-markdown remark-gfm lucide-react\n\n# Supabase\nnpm install @supabase/supabase-js @supabase/ssr\n\n# AI / LLM\nnpm install openai\n\n# Charts & Tables\nnpm install recharts react-is @tanstack/react-table\n\n# UI Utilities\nnpm install sonner react-day-picker date-fns clsx tailwind-merge class-variance-authority\n\n# Dev dependencies\nnpm install -D @types/canvas-confetti\n```\n\n### Step 3: Initialize shadcn/ui\n\n```bash\nnpx shadcn@latest init\n```\n\nWhen prompted, choose:\n- Style: Default\n- Base color: Neutral\n- CSS variables: Yes\n\nAfter initialization, modify `components.json` to add the Kokonut UI registry. The file should look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"default\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"config\": \"\",\n    \"css\": \"src/app/globals.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"neutral\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true\n  },\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@/components/ui\",\n    \"lib\": \"@/lib\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@/hooks\"\n  },\n  \"registries\": {\n    \"kokonutui\": {\n      \"url\": \"https://kokonutui.com/r\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Install shadcn/ui Base Components\n\n```bash\nnpx shadcn@latest add button card dialog dropdown-menu input label select separator sheet skeleton slider switch tabs textarea toast toggle tooltip avatar badge breadcrumb calendar checkbox collapsible command form popover progress radio-group scroll-area table sonner drawer\n```\n\n### Step 5: Install Kokonut UI Components\n\n```bash\nnpx shadcn@latest add kokonutui/ai-input-01\nnpx shadcn@latest add kokonutui/ai-state-loading-01\nnpx shadcn@latest add kokonutui/ai-text-loading\nnpx shadcn@latest add kokonutui/ai-voice-01\nnpx shadcn@latest add kokonutui/bento-grid-01\nnpx shadcn@latest add kokonutui/smooth-drawer-01\nnpx shadcn@latest add kokonutui/smooth-tab-01\nnpx shadcn@latest add kokonutui/dynamic-text-01\nnpx shadcn@latest add kokonutui/morphic-navbar-01\nnpx shadcn@latest add kokonutui/animated-list-01\n```\n\n> **Note**: If any Kokonut component fails to install via CLI, create the component file manually at the expected path and copy the code from https://kokonutui.com/docs. The key components we need are AI Input, AI State Loading, AI Text Loading, Bento Grid, Smooth Drawer, Smooth Tab, Dynamic Text, Morphic Navbar, and Animated List.\n\n### Step 6: Configure Tailwind CSS v4\n\nTailwind v4 uses CSS-first configuration. **Do NOT create a `tailwind.config.js` file.** Edit `src/app/globals.css`:\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n\n@theme {\n  /* Brand Colors */\n  --color-hyrox-yellow: #FFD700;\n  --color-hyrox-black: #0A0A0A;\n  --color-hyrox-dark: #1A1A1A;\n  --color-hyrox-gray: #2A2A2A;\n  --color-hyrox-light: #F5F5F5;\n\n  /* Coach K Accent */\n  --color-coach-blue: #3B82F6;\n  --color-coach-green: #10B981;\n\n  /* Performance Colors */\n  --color-perf-excellent: #22C55E;\n  --color-perf-good: #84CC16;\n  --color-perf-average: #EAB308;\n  --color-perf-below: #F97316;\n  --color-perf-poor: #EF4444;\n\n  /* Station Colors (for radar chart etc) */\n  --color-station-ski: #3B82F6;\n  --color-station-sled-push: #EF4444;\n  --color-station-sled-pull: #F97316;\n  --color-station-burpee: #EAB308;\n  --color-station-row: #22C55E;\n  --color-station-farmers: #8B5CF6;\n  --color-station-lunges: #EC4899;\n  --color-station-wall-balls: #06B6D4;\n\n  /* Fonts */\n  --font-sans: \"Inter\", ui-sans-serif, system-ui, sans-serif;\n  --font-mono: \"JetBrains Mono\", ui-monospace, monospace;\n\n  /* Spacing Scale Overrides (optional) */\n  --radius-lg: 0.75rem;\n  --radius-md: 0.5rem;\n  --radius-sm: 0.25rem;\n}\n\n/* Dark mode as default for athletic app */\n@variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *));\n\n/* Base styles */\n@layer base {\n  :root {\n    --background: 0 0% 100%;\n    --foreground: 0 0% 3.9%;\n    --card: 0 0% 100%;\n    --card-foreground: 0 0% 3.9%;\n    --popover: 0 0% 100%;\n    --popover-foreground: 0 0% 3.9%;\n    --primary: 48 100% 50%;\n    --primary-foreground: 0 0% 4%;\n    --secondary: 0 0% 96.1%;\n    --secondary-foreground: 0 0% 9%;\n    --muted: 0 0% 96.1%;\n    --muted-foreground: 0 0% 45.1%;\n    --accent: 0 0% 96.1%;\n    --accent-foreground: 0 0% 9%;\n    --destructive: 0 84.2% 60.2%;\n    --destructive-foreground: 0 0% 98%;\n    --border: 0 0% 89.8%;\n    --input: 0 0% 89.8%;\n    --ring: 48 100% 50%;\n    --chart-1: 12 76% 61%;\n    --chart-2: 173 58% 39%;\n    --chart-3: 197 37% 24%;\n    --chart-4: 43 74% 66%;\n    --chart-5: 27 87% 67%;\n  }\n\n  .dark {\n    --background: 0 0% 4%;\n    --foreground: 0 0% 98%;\n    --card: 0 0% 7%;\n    --card-foreground: 0 0% 98%;\n    --popover: 0 0% 7%;\n    --popover-foreground: 0 0% 98%;\n    --primary: 48 100% 50%;\n    --primary-foreground: 0 0% 4%;\n    --secondary: 0 0% 15%;\n    --secondary-foreground: 0 0% 98%;\n    --muted: 0 0% 15%;\n    --muted-foreground: 0 0% 64%;\n    --accent: 0 0% 15%;\n    --accent-foreground: 0 0% 98%;\n    --destructive: 0 62.8% 30.6%;\n    --destructive-foreground: 0 0% 98%;\n    --border: 0 0% 15%;\n    --input: 0 0% 15%;\n    --ring: 48 100% 50%;\n    --chart-1: 220 70% 50%;\n    --chart-2: 160 60% 45%;\n    --chart-3: 30 80% 55%;\n    --chart-4: 280 65% 60%;\n    --chart-5: 340 75% 55%;\n  }\n}\n\n@layer base {\n  * {\n    @apply border-border;\n  }\n  body {\n    @apply bg-background text-foreground;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 7: Configure TypeScript (strict mode)\n\nEnsure `tsconfig.json` has:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"strict\": true,\n    \"target\": \"ES2017\",\n    \"lib\": [\"dom\", \"dom.iterable\", \"esnext\"],\n    \"allowJs\": true,\n    \"skipLibCheck\": true,\n    \"esModuleInterop\": true,\n    \"allowSyntheticDefaultImports\": true,\n    \"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true,\n    \"noEmit\": true,\n    \"incremental\": true,\n    \"module\": \"esnext\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"bundler\",\n    \"resolveJsonModule\": true,\n    \"isolatedModules\": true,\n    \"jsx\": \"preserve\",\n    \"plugins\": [{ \"name\": \"next\" }],\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"]\n    }\n  },\n  \"include\": [\"next-env.d.ts\", \"**/*.ts\", \"**/*.tsx\", \".next/types/**/*.ts\"],\n  \"exclude\": [\"node_modules\"]\n}\n```\n\n### Step 8: Create Project Directory Structure\n\nCreate the following directories and placeholder files. Every directory should have at least one file (even if just an empty file or a simple export) so the structure is established.\n\n```\nsrc/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 app/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500

a `.env.local` file with real API keys. Do NOT overwrite it. Only create `.env.local.example` as a template reference.\n\n### Step 10: Create Supabase Client Utilities\n\n**File: `src/lib/supabase/client.ts`**\n```typescript\nimport { createBrowserClient } from '@supabase/ssr'\n\nexport function createClient() {\n  return createBrowserClient(\n    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,\n    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!\n  )\n}\n```\n\n**File: `src/lib/supabase/server.ts`**\n```typescript\nimport { createServerClient } from '@supabase/ssr'\nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\n\nexport async function createClient() {\n  const cookieStore = await cookies()\n\n  return createServerClient(\n    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,\n    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,\n    {\n      cookies: {\n        getAll() {\n          return cookieStore.getAll()\n        },\n        setAll(cookiesToSet) {\n          try {\n            cookiesToSet.forEach(({ name, value, options }) =>\n              cookieStore.set(name, value, options)\n            )\n          } catch {\n            // The `setAll` method was called from a Server Component.\n            // This can be ignored if you have middleware refreshing user sessions.\n          }\n        },\n      },\n    }\n  )\n}\n```\n\n**File: `src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts`**\n```typescript\nimport { createServerClient } from '@supabase/ssr'\nimport { NextResponse, type NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n\nexport async function updateSession(request: NextRequest) {\n  let supabaseResponse = NextResponse.next({\n    request,\n  })\n\n  const supabase = createServerClient(\n    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,\n    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,\n    {\n      cookies: {\n        getAll() {\n          return request.cookies.getAll()\n        },\n        setAll(cookiesToSet) {\n          cookiesToSet.forEach(({ name, value, options }) =>\n            request.cookies.set(name, value)\n          )\n          supabaseResponse = NextResponse.next({\n            request,\n          })\n          cookiesToSet.forEach(({ name, value, options }) =>\n            supabaseResponse.cookies.set(name, value, options)\n          )\n        },\n      },\n    }\n  )\n\n  // IMPORTANT: Do NOT run code between createServerClient and\n  // supabase.auth.getUser(). A simple mistake could make it very\n  // hard to debug issues with users being randomly logged out.\n\n  const {\n    data: { user },\n  } = await supabase.auth.getUser()\n\n  if (\n    !user &&\n

) {\n    // No user \u2014 redirect to login\n    const url = request.nextUrl.clone()\n    url.pathname = '/login'\n    return NextResponse.redirect(url)\n  }\n\n  return supabaseResponse\n}\n```\n\n**File: `src/middleware.ts`** (Next.js middleware at src root)\n```typescript\nimport { type NextRequest } from 'next/server'\nimport { updateSession } from '@/lib/supabase/middleware'\n\nexport async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  return await updateSession(request)\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\n    /*\n     * Match all

'/((?!_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|.*\\\\.(?:svg|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|webp)$).*)',\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n### Step 11: Create Root Layout\n\n**File: `src/app/layout.tsx`**\n```typescript\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\nimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google'\nimport './globals.css'\nimport { Toaster } from '@/components/ui/sonner'\n\nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'], variable: '--font-sans' })\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: 'Hyrox AI Coach',\n  description: 'Your intelligent training partner for Hyrox racing',\n}\n\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\" className=\"dark\">\n      <body className={`${inter.variable} font-sans antialiased`}>\n        {children}\n        <Toaster />\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Step 12: Create Placeholder Pages\n\nFor every page.tsx created in the directory structure, add a simple placeholder:\n\n**File: `src/app/page.tsx`**\n```typescript\nimport { redirect } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  redirect('/dashboard')\n}\n```\n\n**File: `src/app/(auth)/layout.tsx`**\n```typescript\nexport default function AuthLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center bg-background\">\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n**File: `src/app/(app)/layout.tsx`**\n```typescript\nexport default function AppLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"min-h-screen bg-background\">\n      <main className=\"container mx-auto px-4 py-8\">\n        {children}\n      </main>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nFor ALL other page.tsx files (`login`, `signup`, `dashboard`, `coach`, `workouts`, `workouts/log`, `plans`, `performance`, `races`, `goals`, `profile`, `onboarding`), create this pattern:\n\n```typescript\nexport default function PageName() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1 className=\"text-2xl font-bold\">Page Name</h1>\n      <p className=\"text-muted-foreground\">Coming soon...</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nReplace \"PageName\" and \"Page Name\" with the appropriate name for each route.\n\nFor ALL API route.ts files, create this pattern:\n\n```typescript\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport async function GET() {\n  return NextResponse.json({ message: 'Not implemented yet' }, { status: 501 })\n}\n```\n\n### Step 13: Create Utility Constants\n\n**File: `src/lib/constants.ts`**\n```typescript\nexport const HYROX_STATIONS = [\n  { id: 'ski_erg', name: 'Ski Erg', order: 1, unit: 'meters', defaultDistance: 1000 },\n  { id: 'sled_push', name: 'Sled Push', order: 2, unit: 'meters', defaultDistance: 50 },\n  { id: 'sled_pull', name: 'Sled Pull', order: 3, unit: 'meters', defaultDistance:

{ id: 'farmers_carry', name: \"Farmer's Carry\", order: 6, unit: 'meters', defaultDistance: 200 },\n  { id: 'lunges', name: 'Lunges', order: 7, unit: 'meters', defaultDistance: 100 },\n  { id: 'wall_balls', name: 'Wall Balls', order: 8, unit: 'reps', defaultReps: 100 },\n] as const\n\nexport const HYROX_DIVISIONS = [\n  'Men Open', 'Women Open',\n  'Men Pro', 'Women Pro',\n  'Men Doubles', 'Women Doubles', 'Mixed Doubles',\n  'Men 40+', 'Women 40+',\n] as const\n\nexport const RPE_LABELS: Record<number, string> = {\n  1: 'Very Light',\n  2: 'Light',\n  3: 'Light-Moderate',\n  4: 'Moderate',\n  5: 'Moderate-Hard',\n  6: 'Hard',\n  7: 'Very Hard',\n  8: 'Extremely Hard',\n  9: 'Near Max',\n  10: 'Max Effort',\n}\n\nexport const APP_NAME = 'Hyrox AI Coach'\nexport const COACH_NAME = 'Coach K'\n```\n\n### Step 14: Create Types Placeholder\n\n**File: `src/types/index.ts`**\n```typescript\nexport type HyroxStation = {\n  id: string\n  name: string\n  order: number\n  unit: 'meters' | 'reps'\n  defaultDistance?: number\n  defaultReps?: number\n}\n\nexport type HyroxDivision = string\n\nexport type SessionType = 'full_hyrox' | 'station_practice' | 'running' | 'strength' | 'hybrid' | 'recovery'\n```\n\n**File: `src/types/database.ts`**\n```typescript\n// Will be populated with full Supabase types after database migration (Prompt 2)\nexport type Database = Record<string, never>\n```\n\n**File: `src/types/chat.ts`**\n```typescript\nexport type Message = {\n  id: string\n  conversation_id: string\n  role: 'user' | 'assistant' | 'system'\n  content: string\n  created_at: string\n  token_count?: number\n  feedback?: 'positive' | 'negative' | null\n}\n\nexport type Conversation = {\n  id: string\n  user_id: string\n  title: string\n  created_at: string\n  updated_at: string\n}\n\nexport type ChatRequest = {\n  message: string\n  conversation_id?: string\n}\n\nexport type StreamChunk = {\n  type: 'token' | 'done' | 'error'\n  content?: string\n  conversation_id?: string\n  message_id?: string\n  error?: string\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. `npm run dev` runs successfully with no errors\n2. All dependencies are installed (check `package.json`)\n3. The directory structure matches the layout above\n4. `src/app/globals.css` uses Tailwind v4 `@theme` syntax (no `tailwind.config.js` exists)\n5. `.env.local.example` exists with all env var placeholders\n6. Supabase client utilities exist at `src/lib/supabase/{client,server,middleware}.ts`\n7. `src/middleware.ts` exists and handles auth redirects\n8. All placeholder pages render without errors\n9. shadcn/ui components are installed in `src/components/ui/`\n10. TypeScript compiles cleanly with `npx tsc --noEmit`\n````\n\n---\n\n### PROMPT 2: Database Migration & Seed Data\n\n````markdown\n# Claude Code Build Prompt \u2014 Prompt 2: Database Migration & Seed Data\n\n## Context Header\n\nYou are building the **Hyrox AI Coach**, a full-featured training application for Hyrox athletes.\n\n**Tech Stack:**\n- **Frontend**: Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4\n- **Backend**: Next.js API routes + Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, PGVector)\n- **AI**: Fine-tuned Llama 3.3 70B on Nebius + RAG via PGVector\n\n**Project path**: `/Users/zach/Desktop/hyrox-ai-coach/`\n\n**What was built in Prompt 1:**\n- Next.js 16 project initialized with all dependencies\n- Supabase client utilities at `src/lib/supabase/{client,server,middleware}.ts`\n- Directory structure established\n- Environment variables configured\n\n**DO NOT:**\n- Modify the `knowledge_chunks` table or any existing RPC functions (they already exist and contain production data)\n- Drop or alter any existing tables \u2014 this migration should be additive\n- Include any API keys or secrets in migration files\n\n---\n\n## Task: Create the complete SQL migration and seed data\n\n### Step 1: Create Migration Directory\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p supabase/migrations\n```\n\n### Step 2: Create Migration File\n\n**File: `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`**\n\n```sql\n-- ============================================================\n-- Hyrox AI Coach \u2014 Initial Schema Migration\n-- ============================================================\n-- This migration creates all application tables.\n-- It does NOT touch the knowledge_chunks table or existing RPC functions.\n-- ============================================================\n\n-- Enable required extensions (pgvector should already be enabled for knowledge_chunks)\nCREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS \"pgvector\" WITH SCHEMA \"extensions\";\nCREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS \"uuid-ossp\" WITH SCHEMA \"extensions\";\n\n-- ============================================================\n-- 1.
