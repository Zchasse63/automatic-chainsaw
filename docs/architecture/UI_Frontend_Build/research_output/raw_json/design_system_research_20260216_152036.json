          "snippet": "However, that leads to some news that I'm incredibly excited to share.\n\nWith Framer's blessing and support, Framer Motion is now completely independent. I'm spinning it off into its own project, to better serve the whole community.\n\nIntroducing\n\n**Motion**.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nThere are two big changes to highlight. The first is Motion's brand new home, here at motion.dev. Besides a fresh new design, it finally has a much-requested search!\n\nThe second change is also a big request from the community. For a long time, users have asked to use Framer Motion outside of React. Either with vanilla JS, or other frameworks like Vue.\nToday, Motion becomes more than a React library, with an amazing set of vanilla APIs that bring Motion's hybrid engine and extensive feature set to everyone.\n\nIn the coming weeks and months, more features from Framer Motion will make their way to this new vanilla API, and I'll be writing new integration guides that will help you use them everywhere.\n\nBeyond that, expect improved support and documentation, a stronger community, and a renewed focus on developer-facing features.\n\n## Why's this happening?\n\nThis news might be surprising to many, but I think in context it's the natural and obvious next step for Motion.\n\nSix years ago, Framer bought my project Popmotion because they wanted a simple React API, unlimited flexibility, and smooth animations across all devices.\n\nAs Framer moved from prototyping into sites, these animations only became more important because now they're being shared with millions of monthly visitors.\nBut Motion also became wildly successful in its own right, becoming the go-to React animation solution with over 4.5 million weekly downloads on npm.\n\nIt's a part\n\n**of** Framer, but it's also apart **from** Framer, serving a much wider set of users.\n\nWe feel like the best way to ensure Motion's future as a core driver of animations on not just Framer sites, or just React sites, but all sites, is to spin it out as an independent open source project for the community.\nFor Motion, the high demands of Framer (in terms of capability and performance) have made Motion the product that it is today. So Framer users can rest assured that their animations will continue to be powered by Motion in the future.\n\nSpinning out Motion is a bold move by Framer, and I'm super delighted that they're on board as Motion's first sponsor!\n\n## So, what's next?\n\nHonestly, I have a long list of things I want to do next. The hard part will be picking what's first.\n\nNew APIs built on emerging browser features like View Transitions. Bringing the power of Motion's industry-leading layout animations to the new vanilla API. High-level components that are both beautiful and accessible. Better dev tools. Plugins for popular design tools.",

Browser support probably isn't quite there yet for most teams, but we're getting close!\n\n\u2026\n\n## Even more new utilities and variants\n\nWe've added a ton of other new utilities and variants to v4.0 too, including:\n\n**New**\u2014 making it possible to stack up to four layers of box shadows on a single element.\n\n`inset-shadow-*`and\n\n`inset-ring-*`utilities\n\n**New**\u2014 for auto-resizing textareas without writing a single line of JavaScript.\n`field-sizing`utilities\n\n**New**\u2014 so you can finally get rid of those ugly light scrollbars in dark mode.\n\n`color-scheme`utilities\n\n**New**\u2014 for carefully tweaking variable fonts that support different widths.\n\n`font-stretch`utilities\n\n**New**\u2014 for styling non-interactive elements marked with the",

If you're on a desktop, you'll see the\n`pointer-fine` styles applied, which make the touch targets smaller and more precise.\n\nThe\n\n`any-pointer-*` variants work the same way but instead of just checking the user's\n\n*primary* pointing device, they check if *any* pointing device matches. So\n\n`any-pointer-coarse` will match on a laptop with a touchscreen for a example, even if the user also has a mouse connected.\n\n\u2026\n\n## A bunch of other new variants\n\n### Prettier accordions with\n\n`details-content`\n\nWhile you could always add styles to the children of a\n\n`<details>` element, it's been impossible to style the content container itself.\n\nThe new\n\n`details-content` variant targets the content container which is useful for positioning the content container relative to the\n\n`<summary>` element:",

Today,  it's got a new name!\n\nFramer Motion has rebranded to simply \"Motion\", and is now independent of Framer. It's continue to be run by Matt Perry, the original creator of the project.\n\n\u2026\n\n{ts:59} and work on animations kind of under framer to power framer the web Builder essentially now I don't still have any\n{ts:66} links to the old framer motion docs because they are now on the motion docs but essentially if you've followed frame\n{ts:72} or motion at all or you've followed me at all you know that frame or motion has been under this company motion obviously\n\n\u2026\n\n{ts:129} it does a whole lot of it like you can do you know view based animations you have your spring easing stuff like that\n{ts:134} and essentially what's happened here is we've now split off framer motion into motion Dev as an independent project\n{ts:141} under the react version of motion one which is now called just motion so what you're going to see if you look at their\n{ts:147} docks is everything looks exactly the same except now you're going to do npm install motion instead of framer motion\n{ts:153} and you're going to import from motion react and inside of the same Library you're also going to get this additional\n{ts:160} kind of Motion One Library which looks something like this and we're going to get to why that's really cool here in a\n\n\u2026\n\n{ts:180} I've installed both at the same version at the latest version they both work fine and Matt has actually even\n{ts:184} confirmed on his Twitter under the announcement that this is the case so you will continue to use motion you can\n{ts:189} continue to import it from framer motion so nothing breaking in at least you know in the immediate term if you're\n\n\u2026\n\n{ts:229} know if you've ever used framer the site Builder before like the CMS before you'll know that it is built on top of\n{ts:236} react you can build react components inside of framer so I think from what I understand on the outside I'm sure there\n{ts:241} was a lot more push to just keep frame or motion as a react specific Library which does not seem uh from the comments\n{ts:248} and some of the things that I've seen in Discord and some of the conversations I've been seeing is not going to\n{ts:252} continue to be the case in fact this already technically isn't the case because we have this just JS Library\n{ts:257} here that we can use this already existed as Motion One um like I said motion one is or whatever they're\n{ts:263} calling it now just motion is not one to one with framer motion yet but over the next you know however long couple of\n{ts:270} months from what I understand we're going to be seeing a lot more shifts of the tools that are available in framer\n{ts:275} motion or motion react now moving over to the just JS version of this Library so you're going to get a lot more of the\n\n\u2026\n\n{ts:408} and I'm really really excited about potentially being able to expand out into more Frameworks and expand out into\n{ts:415} other parts of the library as it continues to grow and the same is also true for my it so if you're not familiar\n{ts:420} I run a website called H.D hover is an animated UI library for react and Tailwind where pretty much everything I",

In  today's  tutorial,  I'm \n going  to  show  you  how  to  enable  dark\n{ts:5} \n mode  in  Nike  Training  Club  app.  So,  make\n{ts:8} sure  to  watch  the  video  to  the  end  and \n follow  these  four  steps.  And  if  you  find\n{ts:11} \n this  video  helpful,  do  not  forget  to \n\n{ts:13} subscribe  and  leave  a  like. \n So  first  we  will  need  to  see  if  it  is\n{ts:20} \n already  uh  possible  to  enable  the  dark\n{ts:23} mode  in  the  Nike  training  glove  app \n since  all  not  all  the  Nike  application\n{ts:29} \n would  have  such  feature.  So  the  first \n\n{ts:31} thing  that  you  will  need  to  find  or  uh \n to  check  is  the  settings  of  course  and\n{ts:37} \n if  we  could  find  some  night  mode  uh\n{ts:41} settings  we  will  be  able  to  enable  this \n dark  mode  in  it.  So  simply  we  can  go  to\n{ts:47} \n the  settings  by  clicking  on  our  profile \n\n{ts:49} picture  on  the  corner.  You  click  there \n then  we  go  to  settings.  So  all  we  will\n{ts:54} \n be  able  to  find  about  the  application  is\n{ts:57} your  email  settings  uh  your  information. \n You  can  set  up  the  unit  of  measure  that\n{ts:63} \n you  will  want  to  use  workout  settings \n\n{ts:66} etc.  But  as  you  can  see  there  is  nothing \n concerning  uh  the  application  except\n{ts:72} \n your  language  or  the  language  that  you\n{ts:75} are  going  to  use  in  the  application. \n However,  if  we  go  to  the  edit  profile,\n{ts:82} \n that's  what  we'll  find  and  simply  all \n\n{ts:86} you  will  have  is  just  such  this  thing. \n So  you  will  have  only  this  uh  bright\n{ts:93} \n wallpaper  or  bright  background  here  as\n{ts:96} uh  the  light  mode  uh  as  you  can  call  it. \n And  there  is  no  uh  possibility  to  have  a\n{ts:103} \n dark  mode  in  this  uh  application  in \n\n{ts:106} particular.  Otherwise  you  might  find  the \n dark  mode  in  other  Nike  Nike  uh  apps\n{ts:112} \n such  as  the  Nike  running  app  as  we  can\n{ts:116} find  it  here.  So,  we  can  go  to  this  app \n store  and  just  type  Nike  and  then  we  can\n{ts:122} \n find  all  the  other  uh  apps  and  you  will\n{ts:125} find  this  clothing  app  and  the  running \n app.  As  you  can  see,  you  might  find  some\n{ts:132} \n uh  dark  mode  stuff  here.  So,  that's  it. \n\n{ts:136} Thank  you  for  watching  and  see  you  next",

The concept removes background gradients, uses a flat dark surface, and applies softer colors to keep attention on health metrics and trends rather than decorative elements.\nTask\n\nThe task was to rethink the visual presentation of the Whoop interface by simplifying the background, softening the color palette, and making the overall layout cleaner. The goal was to improve focus on information, reduce distraction, and make data easier to read during frequent daily use.\n\nProcess\n\nThe background was simplified to a flat dark tone, completely removing gradients that pulled attention away from data. Colors were made softer and less saturated to reduce visual pressure. Emphasis was shifted from color contrast to typography scale, spacing, and clear hierarchy. Cards and charts were visually simplified to create a calmer and more structured layout.",

          "snippet": "When designing the theme of an event, visuals, lights, and props greatly support decorating the venue and establishing the event\u2019s atmosphere and tone. However, visuals are also powerful communication tools that can represent your brand identity at the same time. Whether it is a product launch, annual general meeting, or gala, the visuals you choose should align with your event theme and brand identity.\n\nIn this article, we share a few tips on how to design event visuals that reinforce your message, increase engagement, and strengthen your brand presence across every stage of your event.\n\n## Why Is Visual Consistency in Events So Important\n\nAn event theme should be aligned with the brand that is hosting it. Visual consistency shapes the audience\u2019s first impression and influences how a brand is perceived throughout the event. Inconsistent visuals can dilute your message and reduce the impact of your brand identity, whereas a cohesive visual language creates a strong and recognizable brand presence.\nWhen planning an event theme, visual storytelling plays a critical role in communicating brand values and tone. Therefore, it is essential to plan in advance a brand guideline so that all visuals, texts, colours, lighting, and every other detail of the event theme align with the brand. Now that we stated the importance of visual consistency, let\u2019s move forward with the tips we have for you.\n\nGo2 Productions \u2013 Event Visuals for NAIOP Awards.\n\n## Starting with a Defined Event Theme\n\nEvery impactful event begins with a clear theme. The theme acts as the foundation for all creative and visual decisions, setting the story and mood you want to communicate. It should align with your brand\u2019s current goals, such as celebrating milestones, introducing innovations, or reinforcing company culture.\nFirst, define the theme with precision. Is it a broad \u201cinnovation summit,\u201d or something more evocative like \u201cfuturistic tech revolution gala\u201d? Next, map out the mood and emotions you want to evoke. Finally, align everything with your audience. For example, corporate executives might crave polished, data-driven infographics in a minimalist style, whereas festival-goers respond to immersive visuals. Nonetheless, every colour, texture, and lighting choice should reinforce your original concept and brand identity while adapting them to the right audience.\n\n## Design Principles for Visual Seamless Integration\n\nOnce you define the theme and align it to your brand, combine them using basic design ideas that anyone can apply. Start with colours that work well together. Choose combinations where shadows from the theme support those from the brand guidelines. Simple online tools like Adobe Colour can help you generate palettes that maintain 60-30-10 ratios (dominant, secondary, accent) for balanced impact.\nFocus on arrangement and structure for clear communication. Aim for even spacing to make designs feel stable, especially for formal occasions, or varied placement for more dynamic ones. Highlight important details, like event titles, by making them larger or bolder so they stand out. Remember to create designs that look good at any size, from a small card to a large wall display.\n\nCheck this Case Study for further reference \ud83d\udc49 WestJet Product Reveal\n\nGo2 Productions \u2013 Projection Mapping for WestJet Product Reveal\n\n## Use AV Technology to Create a Brand Experience\n\nYour brand identity extends beyond logos, fancy font styles and colour palettes; with the use of motion, lighting, and digitally animated content, you can make your brand feel alive and wow your audience by creating a unique experience. Audiovisual technologies such as projection mapping, LED panels, or interactive installations make it possible, as they allow you to display immersive visuals that elevate your event theme and brand identity.\n\n\u2026\n\nWhen visuals ignore brand identity, even the most thematic event can come across as inauthentic, eroding trust faster than a poorly timed keynote.\n\n*Projection Mapping to Decor Venue with Winter Mountains Concept Art*\n\n## The Value of Working with a Specialized Visual Partner\n\nDesigning event visuals that align with your brand and event theme requires both creativity and technical expertise. Partnering with a team that specializes in translating a brand identity with visuals ensures that your event theme and brand are represented correctly and delivers high impact to the audience attending it.\n\nWith a creative team, event organizers can rest assured that every design decision supports their message and delivers flawless results.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nVisuals are one of the most effective ways to express your brand identity and create an emotional connection with your audience. When your event theme and visual design work together, the result is an experience that communicates your message clearly, engages attendees, and elevates your brand.\n\nIf you are planning an event and want to enhance it with immersive visuals and projection mapping, contact us.

          "snippet": "Just like every other industry, sports websites, gyms, and media also need their own fonts to represent themselves and have fonts that match their style, which is why sports fonts are always in huge demand!\n\nFortunately, Google Fonts holds a huge collection of many fun and interesting-looking sports fonts that can easily help you make your designs stand out! In this article, we will be going through the best choices available on Google Fonts! So, whether you are a sports enthusiast or just love the designs of Google fonts for sports, take a seat right now, as you will never find such amazing fonts again!\n\n\u2026\n\n### Racing Sans One\n\nThis font\u2019s name must have told you what it\u2019s based on! And if you guessed car racing, then you are right, as Racing Sans One by Impallari Type is based on popular car races like Formula 1.\n\nThis font fits well for such a role because it has a speedy design, which helps it look strong and fast, just like a real racing car. Although it\u2019s based on a speedy design, Racing Sans One has amazing readability, which is good for both you and your audience. That\u2019s why feel free to use it for car websites, car designs, or your racing competition.\n\n### Poppins\n\nAs mentioned before, bold and confident fonts are the best choice for any sports design, so say hello to Poppins by Indian Type Foundry! Despite being a pretty thin font, Poppins fits well into this list, thanks to its extra-bold version, which is extremely thick, clean, and easy to read! All these elements are perfect for a sports font, which is why it\u2019s on the list.\n\nYou can use this typeface when you don\u2019t want any fancy designs and want to keep a minimal yet effective font as your identity.\n\n### Epilogue\n\nEpilogue has the same case as Poppins; it was not a sports font on Google Fonts originally, but its extra-bold version is what has helped it reach this list. Epilogue is designed by Tyler Finck and shares the same clean and bold design as Poppins in its bold version, which also gives it amazing readability.\nBut what sets it apart is its italic version, which makes it look like a speedy and racing font. So feel free to use it if you are having a bike or car racing tournament, want some cool designs on your favorite bike, or want to make a banner to support your favorite racer.\n\n### Lato\n\nSometimes non-sport fonts can also be good choices for Google fonts for sports, and that\u2019s the same case with Lato as well! It\u2019s designed by \u0141ukasz Dziedzic and isn\u2019t actually a sports font, just like the previous two, but it\u2019s also blessed by its extra-bold version, which helps it stand out from the crowd.\n\nJust like the previous typefaces, Lato also has a confident-looking design, which makes it an amazing choice for gym designs, motivational posters, and even gym websites. Design your logo or headlines with it; they will surely look stunning and sporty.\n\n### Bebas Neue\n\nFortunately, you don\u2019t have to use the bolder version of our next font, as it\u2019s already a bold and clear font known as Bebas Neue. It was designed by Ryoichi Tsunekawa, and Bebas Neue has been a popular typeface since the beginning because of its great design.\n\nIt\u2019s versatile enough to fill any project need, which is even for sports designs. It\u2019s clear and bold, so readability wouldn\u2019t be an issue at all! That\u2019s why you should consider using it for team logos, website logos, jersey numbers, and advertisements to catch some attention.\n\n### Graduate\n\nFinally, here\u2019s a font with a classically sporty design known as the Graduate! It\u2019s designed by Eduardo Tunni and is based on the fonts used in schools and colleges for football tournaments, team designs, and number jerseys.\n\nThat\u2019s why you should feel free to use it for the same ideas, but if you have any new creative thoughts, then give them a try too. This font is also bold, just like every other sports Google font, so do not worry about readability and design your projects the way you want.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Bevan\n\nMost Google fonts for sports listed here are used only for modern designs, but how about diving back into the past and getting a look at a retro sports font? Bevan by Vernon Adams is a vintage sports font that was often used in the past for many sports designs like jerseys, websites, posters, crafts, and many more fun projects.\n\nIt\u2019s bold and has a good, confident look in its designs, so do not hesitate to design your gym\u2019s or basketball court\u2019s logo with it! Its readability is amazing and can even give some good nostalgia too, which is great for both you and your audience.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Exo\n\nAs our last sports Google font, we have Exo by Natanael Gama, which is a blocky sports font! Its blocky design gives it amazing and much-needed readability to stand out in the crowd. Although it\u2019s a sports font, it has its thin versions that are not suitable for sports designs. That\u2019s why you should always consider picking the bolder ones, as they have much better readability and represent designs extremely well!",

Dark mode aims to reduce eye strain and improve readability in low-light environments or for users who prefer a darker interface.\n\n### To implement a dark theme in Tailwind CSS, you can follow these steps:\n\n- The first user must set up tailwind CSS with react, next, or its preferred language.\n\nFor configure tailwind css with react js refer Installing Tailwind CSS in React blog.\n\nFor configure tailwind css with next js refer Optimizing Development Workflow: Setting Up Tailwind CSS and Next.js blog.\n- After make one card component.\n\n```\n\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nfunction Card() {\n\nreturn (\n\n<div className=\"h-5/12 w-5/12 bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-900 p-5 rounded-lg mt-4 text-white\">\n\n<h1 className=\"text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 font-extrabold text-3xl\">\n\n\u2026\n\n</p>\n\n<button className=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 py-2 px-3 font-bold text-blue-800 dark:text-white mt-3 rounded-md border border-gray-400 dark:border-gray-600\">\n\nButton\n\n</button>\n\n</div>\n\n);\n\n\n\nexport default Card;\n\n```\n\n- Import card component into App component.\n```\n\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\n\nimport Card from \"./Card\";\n\nconst App = () => {\n\nconst [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(false);\n\nreturn (\n\n<>\n\n<div\n\nclassName={` w-full flex items-center justify-center flex-col ${\n\ndarkMode && \"dark\"\n\n}`}\n\n\n\n<input type=\"checkbox\" onClick={() => setDarkMode(!darkMode)} />\n\n<!--Import all component -->\n\n<Card />\n\n</div>\n\n</>\n\n);\n\n};\n\nexport default App;\n\n```\n- Your app should now be running with a button for the dark mode. Clicking on the button will chnage mode between the light and dark themes.\n\nMake sure to style your components with the appropriate Tailwind CSS classes and utilize the\n\n**dark** class where necessary to apply the dark theme styles.\n\nModify tailwind.config.js\n```\n\nmodule.exports = {\n\ncontent: [\"./src/**/*.{html,js}\"],\n\ndarkMode: \"class\",\n\ntheme: {\n\nextend: {},\n\n},\n\nplugins: [],\n\n};\n\n```\n\n- Start the development server: Run the following command in your project directory:\n\n```\n\nnpm start or yarn dev\n\n```\nAnd That's it your preview in localhost:3000 is ready and looks like below image\n\nImplementing a dark theme in your application using Tailwind CSS can significantly improve the user experience and make your application more accessible. By following this guide, you can easily add a dark theme to your project and provide users with the option to switch between light and dark mode. You can also customize the dark theme to match your application's design and improve its overall aesthetic.",

HOW TO USE THE HYROX TRAINING CLUB OR PERFORMANCE COACH BRAND\n\n## DO'S\n\n## I.1 Using the \"HYROX Training Club\" or \"HYROX Performance Coach\" Title\n\n- Do use \"HYROX TRAINING CLUB\" (referring to a licensed HYROX Training Club in the following) or \"HYROX Performance Coach\" (referring to a licensed HYROX Performance Coach in the following) in your business communications and marketing materials\n\n- Do use this title on your social media profiles\n\n- Do put \"HYROX TRAINING CLUB\" or \"HYROX Performance Coach\" on your gym's signage\n\n- Do use the title in both digital and physical formats\n\n## I.2 Brand and Logo Usage\n\n- \"HYROX TRAINING CLUB\" or \"HYROX Performance Coach\" logos\n\n- Do include these logos in your print & digital marketing materials\n\n- Do use the logos on your website\n\n- Do follow HYROX's corporate brand guidelines strictly\n\n## I.3 Promotional Activities\n\n- Do market your training sessions using the \"HYROX Training Club\" name. (e.g., As an Official HYROX Training Club, we host HYROX Classes! Join us on Thursday etc) or the \"HYROX Performance Coach\" name\n\n- Do promote small in-house events with \"HYROX Training Club\" branding or \"HYROX Performance Coach\" Event branding\n\n- Do use assets from the Performance Hub for marketing\n\n- Do clearly state that your events are not official HYROX events\n\n# II. HOW NOT TO USE THE HYROX TRAINING CLUB OR PERFORMANCE COACH BRAND\n\n## DON'TS\n\n## II.1 Title Misuse\n\n- Don't combine \"HYROX TRAINING CLUB\" or \"HYROX PERFORMANCE COACH\" with anything but your gym name or your name\n\n- Don't use titles like \"HYROX Gym\", \"HYROX COACH\", \"HYROX SEMINAR\", \"HYROX Event\", \"HYROX Camp\", \"HYROX\", \"HY\", \"ROX\", \"HRX\" or \"HYSociety\"\n\n- Don't use HYROX in your business name or personal name.\n\n- Don't name your gym just \"HYROX\"\n\n- Don't include \"HYROX\" in your personal name or social media handles\n\n- Don't use variations like \"HYROX Gym\", \"HYROX Coach\", \"HY\", \"ROX\", \"HRX\" or \"HYSociety\" in your business name\n\n- The key point is that while you can use \"HYROX TRAINING CLUB\" or \"HYROX PERFORMANCE COACH\" to indicate your affiliation, you should not use \"HYROX\" by itself or incorporate it directly into your business name or personal branding. This helps maintain the distinction between your affiliated gym, you as the affiliate Coach and the official HYROX brand.\n\n## II.2 Branding Violations\n\n- Don't use HYROX's visual identity exactly as they are (e.g., as profile pictures)\n\n- Don't use any HYROX branding materials not provided to you\n\n- Don't modify HYROX logos or combine them with other marks\n\n- Don't create designs that might confuse your affiliation with HYROX\n\n## III. 3 Other Restrictions\n\n- Don't transfer your rights to use HYROX branding to others\n\n- Don't dilute or misrepresent the HYROX brand in any way\n\n- Don't introduce conflicting branding elements, e.g,:\n\n- Create logos or designs that closely resemble HYROX's official branding\n\n- Use colour schemes or typography that might be mistaken for official HYROX materials\n\n- Develop marketing campaigns that could be confused with HYROX's official promotions\n\n- Introduce elements that clash with HYROX's brand aesthetic or message\n\n**Examples of Conflicting Elements:**\n\n- Using a similar font or colour scheme as HYROX for your gym's main branding\n\n- Creating a logo that's like HYROX's official logo\n\n- Designing marketing materials that look like they could be official HYROX communications\n\n- Using slogans or taglines that might be mistaken for official HYROX messaging\n\n- The goal is to maintain a clear distinction between your gym's or coach's identity and HYROX's brand while still benefiting from the affiliation. Your branding should complement HYROX's, not compete with or confuse it. This helps preserve the integrity of both your gym's or coach's identity and the HYROX brand.\n\n- Don't use the city/town name of where you are located for hosting HYROX events/simulations (e.g., HYROX Hamburg, Texas, London, etc). Using the city name as your event title, e.g., \"HYROX Liverpool\" can cause confusion because it does not clearly indicate that the event is a HYROX Training Club Race simulation, and could be mistaken for an official HYROX event. To address this issue, it is advisable to use \"HYROX Training Club Race Simulation at (name of the gym)\" This ensures clarity and helps participants to easily identify the nature of the event, aligning it with their expectations and search criteria.\n\n- Don't use HYROX branding in ways not explicitly permitted. e.g.,\n\n- Create new HYROX-branded products or merchandise without approval\n\n- Use HYROX branding on items or in contexts not specified in your agreement\n\n- Modify HYROX logos or branding elements in any way\n\n- Apply HYROX branding to non-HYROX related events or services\n\n**Examples of Unauthorised Usage:**\n\n- Printing HYROX logos on t-shirts or other merchandise for sale\n\n- Using HYROX branding in advertising for non-HYROX fitness classes\n\n- Creating HYROX-branded social media filters or stickers without permission\n\n- Creating flags or patches that are only meant to be giving at main HYROX events\n\n- Applying HYROX logos to gym equipment or other physical items not approved by HYROX\n\n- The key is to only use HYROX branding in the specific ways outlined in your agreement. If you're unsure about a particular use, it's best to ask for permission first. Please contact your regional account manager.\n\n# III. (PROHIBITED) USE OF HYROX NAME OR TRADEMARK\n\n## Affiliates and partners shall not incorporate the HYROX name or trademark into any digital identifier, including but not limited to\n\n- Email addresses\n\n- Social media handles or usernames\n\n- Website URLs or domain names\n\n- App names\n\nSpecifically prohibited are uses such as:\n\n- HYROXLondon@gmail.com\n\n- @HYROX_Chicago\n\n- www.hyroxboston.com\n\n- HYROX Timer App\n\nThe HYROX name and trademark may only be used as authorised in the official licensing agreement. Any use that could imply ownership, control, or official status by the affiliate/partner is strictly prohibited. The HYROX name must remain distinct and separate from the affiliate/partner's own branding and identifiers. Affiliates and partners shall use their own unique identifiers that do not incorporate the HYROX trademark. Acceptable alternatives may include:\n\n- LondonFitnessRace@gmail.com\n\n- @ChicagoFitnessChallenge\n\n- www.bostonraceseries.com\n\nAny questions regarding the appropriate use of the HYROX name should be directed to your local country account managers. HYROX reserves the right to take action against any unauthorised use of its trademarks.\n\n",

          "snippet": "Recently, there's been a trend of using noisy backgrounds, whether static, animated, or combined with gradients. The simplest implementation is to use a big background image, but that's not the most performant solution and can negatively impact UX, especially on slow internet connections.\n\nSo, here's a quick guide on creating a noisy background and gradient in CSS.\n\nWe'll use SVG filters, specifically\n\n`feTurbulence`, to create noise. The\n\n`baseFrequency` and\n\n`numOctaves` parameters determine the amount of noise. For more information about SVG Filters, check out this article.\n\nLet's start by creating a pseudo-element that we can reuse in many elements of our app. It includes an inlined SVG of the noise pattern we created with feTurbulence. It will be much more performant to load a few lines of SVG than a big background image. From the network perspective but also parsing time, it's a huge difference. If you don't like this pattern, you can create your own here: https://grainy-gradients.vercel.app/\n\nAnd that's almost it! Now, we only need to apply the class to an element, and we're done. Here's the full code:\n\nAnd here's how it looks:\n\nOne drawback I found with this solution is that you can't properly animate it. If you want the background to progressively change from transparent to full opacity, you'll have to use JS and modify the alpha value of the background color. This is more expensive than using simple CSS keyframes, but it's an acceptable tradeoff for me.\n\nI was too lazy to convert the code to bare CSS, so it's in TailwindCSS. If you prefer to use CSS, you can use a TailwindCSS to CSS converter like this one.\n\nPublished on July 6, 2024 \u2022 2 min read\n\n",

We've got the same effect:\n\nPretty clever, but I dug further and found how to both create the noisy texture itself as well as generate it inline in our code.\n\n\u2026\n\n```\n\n<feTurbulence\n\ntype='fractalNoise'\n\nbaseFrequency='1'\n\nnumOctaves='3'\n\nstitchTiles='stitch'/>\n\n</filter>\n\n```\n\nThen we're defining the shape (a rectangle), the size (100%) and applying the\n\n`feTurbulence` filter to it:\n\n```\n\n<rect width='100%' height='100%' filter='url(#noiseFilter)'/>\n\n```\n\nIf we throw this in our HTML now, it'll display as plain noise:\n\n*SVG feTurbulence noise image*\n\n\u2026\n\nI changed the\n\n`baseFrequency='1'` in the SVG file for appearance's sake, and then added the following to our CSS:\n\n```\n\n.noise2{\n\nbackground: rgb(219, 255, 219);\n\nbackground-image: url(/assets/noise.svg);\n\n\n\n```\n\nThis gives us a similar result for our green background section:\n\n\u2026\n\nIt uses gradients going from opaque to transparent to allow for the noise to show through. You can achieve the same effect on a solid color background by repeating some of our code from above.\n\nWe'll create a third\n\n`div` for this example:\n\n```\n\n<section class=\"container noise3\">\n\n<h1>Noise with SVG Inline</h1>\n\n</section>\n\n```\n\n\u2026\n\ntype='fractalNoise' baseFrequency='4' numOctaves='3' stitchTiles='stitch'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Crect width='100%25' height='100%25' filter='url(%23noiseFilter)'/%3E%3C/svg%3E\");\n\n\n\n```\n\nThe parameters are easily editable on all these SVGs and filters to produce different grainy effects. I hope this has been a helpful tutorial for you to easily spice up your backgrounds!",

250\u2013400ms for large context switches; longer for intros only. **Ease & physics:**Springs feel natural; easing curves suit simple fades/slides. **Prefer transform/opacity:**Avoid animating layout-affecting properties (top/left/width/height) unless using FLIP or\n\n\u2026\n\n## Shared best practices (for both libraries)\n\n**Animate presence**: For mount/unmount transitions, wrap lists and conditionals with a provider (\n\n`AnimatePresence`in FM,\n\n`useTransition`in Spring).\n\n**Stagger responsibly**: Small staggering (40\u201380ms) guides the eye without feeling slow. **Keep state local**: Animation controls near the animated node reduce re-renders. **Avoid layout thrash**: Batch reads/writes;

Learn how to add some texture to them using a little bit of code.\n\n\u2026\n\n{ts:186} Well, it's not actually\nCSS because we haven't written any CSS, but\nit's easiest using SVGs. And if you play around with\nthis base frequency for\n{ts:199} example, you can increase its value. And you'll see that as you\nincrease the base frequency, the dots in the noise gets smaller and\n\n\u2026\n\nthe other let's just make it black. Like so.\n{ts:269} All right, so\nthat's gonna define this gradient here. To add our noise, we can simply add another background,\n{ts:284} this time in the form of a URL. So what we can do is we can\nactually copy the SVG data.\n\n\u2026\n\nyou can add a filter,\n{ts:348} a CSS filter to increase the contrast and\nbrightness. So contrast, let's put it at 200%,\nand brightness at let's say 250. And that's just gonna make this\nnoise really, really visible.\n{ts:367} So to recap, two ingredients for\nthis recipe, you add the SVG data as a background\nto the element that you want. And you can mix that up with\na gradient of your choosing, and\n{ts:383} optionally increase the contrast and\nbrightness. Now, if you wanna play\naround with this technique, there is also a playground that can\n\n\u2026\n\n{ts:659} I'm gonna set a z-index to minus one,\nto be able to stack these properly. And then on the before pseudo element,\nI'm gonna set the background to black, and I'm gonna set the filter\nURL noise filter.\n{ts:677} And this will basically\ntake us right here, right?\n\n\u2026\n\n{ts:807} But they should work just\nfine in other browsers. But yeah, that's the second way of\ncreating a gradient mesh with noise. You basically define two pseudo elements,\nbefore and after,\n{ts:823} one of them contains the SVG filter,\nand the other contains the color. And then you just blend them together\n\n\u2026\n\n{ts:853} technique that I showed you previously,\nfor creating a noisy gradient mesh. So we start with two pseudo\nelements just like before, in the HTML part we have\nthe SVG defined with our noise.\n{ts:869} And then on the before pseudo element, we can do exactly the same thing, just a black background and\n\n\u2026\n\nAll right, see there's the noise coming in\nthrough the lighter areas of the image? We can even use our own\nfilter to boost the contrast,\n{ts:951} let's say to 100%, and maybe the brightness to 150%. Right, and\nthat's just gonna make it more visible.\n{ts:967} Or we can choose another mix blend mode,\n\n\u2026\n\n{ts:1004} predominantly in the lighter\nareas of the image. But also we can see it sipping through\nin the darker areas of the image, so this is a very simple technique.\n{ts:1016} As I said before,\ntwo elements, a before and an after,\nyou set a mix-blend-mode on both of them.\n\n\u2026\n\na solid color or smooth gradient. In CSS, start by using the feTurbulence\nnoise filter on an SVG element,\n{ts:1109} then apply a background with\na gradient and the SVG filter. If necessary, use a CSS filter to increase\nthe noise, brightness, and contrast. Optionally, use mix blend mode to",

They probably use spring-based animations, but if we had to convert it into an easing type, it would be an ease-out curve.\n\n\u2026\n\n```\n\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion';\n\nconst EaseInOutAnimation = () => {\n\nreturn (\n\n<motion.div\n\ninitial={{ y: -100 }}\n\nanimate={{ y: 0 }}\n\ntransition={{ duration: 1, ease: 'easeInOut' }}\n\nclassName=\"rounded bg-purple-500 p-4 text-white\"\n\n\n\nEase-In-Out Effect\n\n</motion.div>\n\n);\n\n};\n\n```\n\n\u2026\n\nA marquee is a good use case for linear easing type.\n### Ease\n\nA similar curve to ease-in-out, but it's asymmetrical; it starts faster and ends slower than an ease-in-out curve. I use this one mostly for hover effects that transition color, background-color, opacity, and so on.\n\n```\n\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion';\n\nconst EaseAnimation = () => {\n\nreturn (\n\n<motion.div\n\nwhileHover={{ scale: 1.2 }}\n\ntransition={{ duration: 0.3, ease: 'ease' }}\n\nclassName=\"rounded bg-yellow-500 p-4 text-white\"\n\n\n\nHover me\n\n</motion.div>\n\n);\n\n};\n\n```\n\n\u2026\n\n## Choosing the Right Easing Function\n\n### When to Use Which Easing\n\n- Linear: Use for consistent, uninterrupted movements, such as a progress bar.\n\n- Ease-In: Ideal for elements that need to accelerate into place, such as an entering slide.\n\n- Ease-Out: Perfect for elements that need to decelerate, like a fading notification.\n\n- Ease-In-Out: Best for balanced animations, like a modal appearing and disappearing.\n\n- Bounce: Suitable for playful elements, like button clicks or icon animations.\n\n- Elastic: Use for elements that need to emphasize flexibility, like a dropdown menu or a draggable component.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEasing functions are a critical component in creating captivating animations that make users stop and take notice. With framer-motion, applying these functions becomes straightforward, allowing developers to focus on designing engaging and responsive user interfaces. By understanding and leveraging the different types of easing, including custom curves by Benjamin De Cock, you can create animations that not only look good but also enhance the overall user experience.\n\nHarness the power of framer-motion and the diverse range of easing functions to create animations that truly stand out. Whether it's a subtle ease-in-out transition or a playful bounce effect, the right easing can make all the difference.",

Now the principles for surfaces colors following elevation is pretty consistent: darker colors appear lower or farther away, lighter colors appear higher or closer to your eyes.\n\n## Examples: dark & light mode elevations using surface color alone\n\nUsing surface color alone to depict elevation.\n\nUsing surface color alone to depict elevation.\n\nBut oftentimes, you\u2019re working with a limited color palette for consistency, and just the elevation jumps alone are not enough to create a cohesive sense of depth.\n\n## Examples: dark & light mode elevations using box shadows alone\n\nUsing box shadows alone to depict elevation.\n\nUsing box shadows alone to depict elevation.\n\nNow we\u2019re getting somewhere interesting\u2026 The box shadows alone could be enough to depict elevation on the light themes, but are basically imperceptible in the dark theme. Again, the physics of light spoils our fun: shadows are dark values \u2014 a representation of the inverse of light cast on an interface, depicted by a screen which casts light.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Depicting elevation with both light and shadow\n\nUsing surface colors and box shadows to depict elevation.\n\nUsing surface colors and box shadows to depict elevation.\n\nCloser\u2026 we\u2019ve definitely got something feeling more consistent about communicating elevation across both themes. But to my eye, the dark themes are only communicating that based on the surface colors, and truthfully the shadows are too subtle to come through at all.\n\nI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever seen this discussed in dark vs. light theme design, but it seems to me that theming needs to extend to all uses of shadows, not just surface/fill colors.\n\n## Depicting elevation with custom shadows and surface colors for each theme\n\nUsing theme-specific shadows and surface colors to depict elevation.\n\nUsing theme-specific shadows and surface colors to depict elevation.\n\nOh\u2026 oh yeah\u2026 Those are nice.\n\nAnyways! That\u2019s all for this note. This was a bit of an experiment to try using this website as a playground to explore interface design in the context of an app, rather than just a design file. Hope you enjoyed it, and I hope to explore more pieces like this!\n# References & Further Reading\n\n~ ~ ~",

          "snippet": "*While shadows have traditionally been the go-to method for expressing elevation in light mode, they aren\u2019t as effective in dark mode.* This is where mastering elevation without relying on shadows becomes crucial.\n\nIn dark UI design, the focus shifts from shadows to using color variations and elevation to create depth. This approach ensures that your UI remains clean, accessible, and visually appealing without the harshness that shadows can introduce in a dark environment.\n**Why Elevation Over Shadows in Dark UI?** **Visual Comfort**: In dark mode, shadows can often appear harsh or unnatural, disrupting the seamless, soothing experience that dark UIs aim to provide. By using elevation, we can create a more subtle and harmonious design. **Perceptual Depth**: Elevation in dark UI is expressed through slight variations in color lightness.\nThis technique mimics how light affects surfaces in a real-world, low-light environment, making the UI feel more natural and intuitive. **Consistent Hierarchy**: Using elevation rather than shadows ensures a consistent visual hierarchy across your design. It clearly indicates which elements are interactive, primary, or secondary, guiding users naturally through your interface. **The Anatomy of a Usable Elevation System**\nCreating an elevation system for dark UI involves a thoughtful approach, where each step in elevation corresponds to a slight change in color lightness. Here\u2019s what it takes to build a usable elevation system:\n\n**Start with a Strong Base Color**:\n\n- Choose a base color that is NOT pure black. Pure black (\n\n`#000000`) can create high contrast that\u2019s harsh on the eyes, making it difficult to focus for long periods. Instead, opt for a dark gray or a very dark shade of another color (e.g.,\n\n\u2026\n\nUsing your base color, create a series of lighter shades that represent different elevation levels. For instance, you might lighten your base color by 4-5% for each step in elevation:\n\n**Base Color (0dp):** **#1E1F22** **Level 1 (1dp):**\n\n`(Lighten by 4%)`\n\n\u2026\n\n**#393C41** **3. Align Components to Elevation Levels**\n\nMap your UI components to these levels:\n\n**Level 0**: Base background, used for large, non-interactive surfaces. **Level 1-2**: Buttons, cards, and small containers that need subtle elevation. **Level 3-4**: Modals, dialogs, and primary interactive elements that require more prominence. **Level 5**: Hover states, focus indicators, and other highly interactive elements. **4. Embrace the Importance of Primary and Accent Colors**\nYour primary and accent colors should contrast well with your elevation levels to ensure accessibility. For example, a vibrant accent color like a muted blue or purple should stand out against your dark base and elevated surfaces.\n\n**5. Play with Hue Adjustments**\n\nIf you want to introduce a subtle tint or accent, you can shift the hue of your entire color palette. This approach can be especially useful if you want to align your dark UI with brand colors or create thematic variations. By adjusting the hue while maintaining lightness and saturation, you can quickly transform the feel of your UI.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Practical Steps:\n\n**Hue Shift in Design Tools**:\n\n- Most design tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD allow you to adjust the hue of colors. You can shift the hue slider slightly in your color picker.\n\n**Testing**:\n\n- After adjusting the hue, test the palette on different UI elements to ensure it still provides the right contrast and readability.\n\n**Subtlety**:\n\n- Keep the hue shift subtle so that it enhances your design without overwhelming the dark mode's primary goal of being easy on the eyes.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Use Cases:\n\n**Branding**: If your brand has specific colors, shifting the hue slightly towards one of those colors can create a more branded dark mode. **Theming**: You can create different themes (e.g., a \"cool blue\" dark mode or a \"warm sepia\" dark mode) by adjusting the hue for different user preferences.\n\n\u2026\n\nThese colors can be easily adjusted in Figma by simply shifting the hue or adjusting the lightness.\n\n**Conclusion: The Importance of Elevation in Dark UI**\n\nElevation is not just about creating depth\u2014it\u2019s about guiding the user\u2019s journey through your interface. In dark UI design, where shadows are less effective, mastering elevation through color lightness is key to creating a clear, intuitive, and visually comfortable experience. By following these guidelines, you can develop a dark UI that is both beautiful and functional, ensuring that every interaction feels intentional and engaging.",

          "snippet": "**A Deep Dive into Elevation for Dark UI**\n\nElevation in user interface design refers to the perceived depth of UI elements, giving them a sense of dimension on a two-dimensional screen. It\u2019s a powerful tool to emphasize visual hierarchy and guide user interaction. While shadows effectively convey elevation in light mode, they often lack the subtlety required in dark mode. Here, the focus shifts from shadows to carefully managed colour variations, ensuring that the design remains both functional and visually soothing.\n**Why Choose Elevation Over Shadows in Dark Mode?** **Visual Comfort**: Shadows can appear harsh in dark mode, disrupting the smooth experience. By leveraging colour variations for elevation, designs can maintain a balanced, harmonious feel. **Natural Depth**: Adjusting colour lightness rather than adding shadows mimics real-world lighting effects, providing a more intuitive, low-light experience. **Consistent Hierarchy**: Elevation through colour establishes a clear visual hierarchy, guiding users seamlessly and indicating which elements are interactive, primary, or secondary.\n**Creating an Effective Elevation System for Dark UI**\n\nTo build a usable elevation system for dark mode, it\u2019s essential to base each elevation level on gradual colour lightness changes. Here\u2019s how to structure it:\n\n**Start with a Comfortable Base Color**: Avoid pure black (#000000) as it can strain the eyes. Opt instead for a deep grey or another dark tone (like #1E1F22) for a softer, more user-friendly base. **Define Elevation Levels**: Use 4\u20136 levels of lightness, with each level subtly lightening the base color. For example:\n\n\u2026\n\n**Assign Components to Elevation Levels**: Map UI components to these elevation levels based on their prominence:\n\n- Level 0: Main background\n\n- Level 1\u20132: Buttons, cards, and small containers\n\n- Level 3\u20134: Modals and primary interactive elements\n\n- Level 5: Focus states and hover effects\n**Leveraging Primary and Accent Colors for Contrast**\n\nTo ensure accessibility, use primary and accent colours that stand out against your dark base and elevated shades. A subtle accent colour, such as a muted blue or purple, can help create a balanced contrast.\n\n**Experiment with Hue Adjustments for Thematic Variations**\n\nIf you wish to introduce a tint or match brand colours, try a slight hue shift across the palette. For instance, a cool blue tone can give a dark UI a cohesive, professional feel:\n- Original Base: #202124\n\n- Hue-Shifted Base: #202128 (for a subtle blue tint)\n\nThis can be easily managed in design tools like Figma by shifting the hue slider or adjusting lightness and saturation levels.\n\n**Sample Color Palette for Dark Mode UI**\n\n- Base: #202124\n\n- Level 1: #252629\n\n- Level 2: #2C2D32\n\n- Level 3: #323438\n\n- Level 4: #393C41\n**Conclusion: Elevation as a Guide in Dark UI**\n\nEffective elevation goes beyond creating depth; it\u2019s about leading users through the interface naturally. In dark mode, where shadows are less impactful, mastering elevation through controlled color adjustments is vital for an engaging, intuitive experience. With these practices, your dark UI can feel as comfortable as a dimly lit room, providing users with a smooth, immersive experience.",

In general, your colors should have around 20 points lower saturation on dark mode than on light mode. See below how Google approached their theme colors.\n\nIn light mode, we usually use shadows to communicate depth. The higher the surface is, the closer it is to the light source and the bigger shadow it casts. While this approach wouldn't work in a dark mode, we can use the same \"light source\" theory and apply it to the surface color.\nSo instead of changing only the shadow size, we can also make the surface lighter the higher it is. Think about the light source being closer and shining brighter on the surface.\n\nYour first instinct might be to choose pure black as the default surface color. But be careful, white text on a black background has such a high contrast that it might be hard to look at.",

          "snippet": "# good dark mode shadows & elevation\n\n~ ~ ~\n\nYou know what\u2019s really really hard to get right in dark interfaces? Shadows. Something that you have to be careful and subtle with in light interfaces is barely imperceptable in dark interfaces.\n\nA lot of this is just thanks to the physics of light.\n\nScreens are devices which emit light. When it comes to depicting elevation in digital interfaces, we\u2019re normally relying on surfaces & shadows \u2014 ie: colors. Now the principles for surfaces colors following elevation is pretty consistent: darker colors appear lower or farther away, lighter colors appear higher or closer to your eyes.\n\n## Examples: dark & light mode elevations using surface color alone\n\nUsing surface color alone to depict elevation.\n\nUsing surface color alone to depict elevation.\n\nBut oftentimes, you\u2019re working with a limited color palette for consistency, and just the elevation jumps alone are not enough to create a cohesive sense of depth.\n\n## Examples: dark & light mode elevations using box shadows alone\n\nUsing box shadows alone to depict elevation.\n\nUsing box shadows alone to depict elevation.\n\nNow we\u2019re getting somewhere interesting\u2026 The box shadows alone could be enough to depict elevation on the light themes, but are basically imperceptible in the dark theme. Again, the physics of light spoils our fun: shadows are dark values \u2014 a representation of the inverse of light cast on an interface, depicted by a screen which casts light.\n\nThe shadows applied to light mode are at the opposite side of the tonal spectrum as the boxes they wrap around, so their presence is glaring and this is why designers often talk about the importance of being subtle with shadows, but what they should mean is to be subtle with shadows in light mode.\n\nOkay, so what if we combine these two techniques?\n\n## Depicting elevation with both light and shadow\n\nUsing surface colors and box shadows to depict elevation.\n\nUsing surface colors and box shadows to depict elevation.\n\nCloser\u2026 we\u2019ve definitely got something feeling more consistent about communicating elevation across both themes. But to my eye, the dark themes are only communicating that based on the surface colors, and truthfully the shadows are too subtle to come through at all.\n\nI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever seen this discussed in dark vs. light theme design, but it seems to me that theming needs to extend to all uses of shadows, not just surface/fill colors.\n\n## Depicting elevation with custom shadows and surface colors for each theme\n\nUsing theme-specific shadows and surface colors to depict elevation.\n\nUsing theme-specific shadows and surface colors to depict elevation.\n\nOh\u2026 oh yeah\u2026 Those are nice.\n\nAnyways! That\u2019s all for this note. This was a bit of an experiment to try using this website as a playground to explore interface design in the context of an app, rather than just a design file. Hope you enjoyed it, and I hope to explore more pieces like this!\n\n# References & Further Reading\n\n~ ~ ~\n\n",

          "snippet": "## What Makes a Font Easy to Read\n\nSeveral specific characteristics determine whether a typeface offers high\n\n**text clarity** or causes reading fatigue.\n\nResearch from MIT\u2019s AgeLab and Stanford\u2019s reading studies consistently points to the same factors.\n\n### X-Height Ratio\n\nThe x-height is the distance between the baseline and the top of lowercase letters like \u201ca\u201d and \u201ce.\u201d\n\nFonts with larger x-heights (55-60% of cap height) score higher on legibility tests. Verdana and Georgia were specifically designed with generous x-heights for screen display.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Stroke Uniformity\n\nFonts with consistent stroke widths maintain clarity across different sizes and screen resolutions.\n\nHigh stroke contrast (thick/thin variation) works beautifully in headlines but reduces legibility in paragraph text.\n\n### Character Distinction\n\nReadable fonts make it easy to distinguish similar characters: lowercase \u201cl,\u201d uppercase \u201cI,\u201d and the number \u201c1.\u201d\n\nSame goes for \u201c0\u201d versus \u201cO\u201d and \u201crn\u201d versus \u201cm.\u201d Poor distinction causes reading errors and slows comprehension.\n\n\u2026\n\n## How Screen Resolution Influences Font Clarity\n\n**Pixel density** dramatically changes how fonts render and appear to readers.\n\nWhat looks crisp on a Retina display may appear fuzzy on an older monitor.\n\n### Standard Displays (72-100 PPI)\n\nOlder monitors and budget laptops fall into this range.\n\nSans-serif fonts like Arial, Verdana, and Tahoma perform better here because their simple shapes render cleanly without subpixel antialiasing artifacts.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Transitional Serifs\n\nTimes New Roman, Georgia, and Bookman sit between old-style and modern.\n\nHigher contrast than old-style but not extreme. Versatile across print and screen applications.\n\n### Modern Serifs\n\nBodoni and Didot have dramatic thick-thin contrast.\n\nStunning in headlines, difficult in body text. The hairline strokes disappear at small sizes, especially on screens.\n\n\u2026\n\n### What is the most readable Google Font?\n\n**Roboto** leads with over 87 billion views, designed for Android\u2019s interface. Open Sans follows with 42 billion views as a versatile humanist sans-serif. Both offer excellent legibility across devices and screen sizes.\n\n### Does letter spacing affect readability?\n\nYes. Research shows slightly increased tracking (2-5% wider) improves reading speed. A 2012 study found 20% faster reading for dyslexic children with expanded spacing. Default tracking works for most standard body text.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSelecting\n\n**the easiest fonts to read** comes down to understanding your medium, audience, and context.\n\nFor screen display, humanist sans-serif options like Verdana, Open Sans, and Roboto deliver consistent legibility across devices. Print projects benefit from time-tested serifs like Garamond and Caslon.",

          "snippet": "## Step 0: Leveraging Tailwind's Default Dark Mode\n\nTailwind provides built-in support for dark mode through its\n\n`dark` variant. When we use utility classes like\n\n`text-black dark:text-white`, Tailwind will automatically switch between these styles based on the user's system preferences.\n\nLet's look at a simple blog post card component and understand how Tailwind handles its dark mode styling:\n\n\u2026\n\nThis CSS transformation reveals two important aspects of how Tailwind v4 works. First, it uses the\n\n`prefers-color-scheme` media query to detect system theme preferences. When a user's system is set to dark mode, any styles within this media query automatically activate. Second, and notably in v4, it leverages CSS variables for colors. Instead of hardcoding color values, Tailwind now uses CSS custom properties (like\n\n`var(--color-white)`), making the entire theming system more flexible and performant. These variables are defined at the root level of your CSS, allowing for easy theme customization and manipulation.\n\n## Step 1: Custom Theme Control\n\nNow, we'll enhance our setup to support explicit theme selection through a dropdown select. This involves three key pieces: configuring Tailwind to respect our custom theme attribute, creating a theme management system, and an user interface for theme selection.\n\nOne of the most significant changes when implementing dark mode in v4 is the shift in how dark variants are configured. In Tailwind v3, dark mode configuration was managed through the\n`tailwind.config.js` file:\n\n```\n\n/** For Tailwind v3 */\n\n/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */\n\nmodule.exports = {\n\ndarkMode: ['variant', '&:not(.light *)'],\n\n// ...\n\n\n\n```\n\nIn v4, we define our dark variant behavior alongside our Tailwind import, in the main css file:\n```\n\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n\n@variant dark (&:where([data-theme=\"dark\"], [data-theme=\"dark\"] *));\n\n```\n\nInstead of relying heavily on the JavaScript configuration file, v4 moves configuration options directly into CSS. For example, we can now define custom colors as CSS variables (\n`--color-primary: #ff0000;`), configure variants using\n\n`@variant` directives.\n\nNow our configuration tells Tailwind to apply dark styles when it finds a\n\n`data-theme=\"dark\"` attribute, rather than relying on system preferences.\n\nThen, we need a place to manage this\n\n`data-theme` attribute. Hence, let\u2019s create our theme management system:\n\n\u2026\n\nThen, we create a select component that gives users explicit control over their theme choice:\n\n```\n\n// ThemeSelect.jsx\n\nexport function ThemeSelect() {\n\nconst { theme, setTheme } = useTheme();\n\nreturn (\n\n<select\n\nvalue={theme}\n\nonChange={(e) => setTheme(e.target.value)}\n\nclassName=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 text-black dark:text-white p-2 rounded border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600\"\n\n\n\n<option value=\"light\">Light</option>\n\n<option value=\"dark\">Dark</option>\n\n</select>\n\n);\n\n\n\n```\nFinally, we wrap our application with the ThemeProvider and place the ThemeSelect component where we want the theme controls to appear:\n\n```\n\n// App.jsx\n\nfunction App() {\n\nreturn (\n\n<ThemeProvider>\n\n<div className=\"min-h-screen bg-white dark:bg-gray-900\">\n\n<nav className=\"p-4\">\n\n<ThemeSelect />\n\n</nav>\n\n{/* Rest of your application */}\n\n</div>\n\n</ThemeProvider>\n\n);\n\n\n\n```\n\nNow user can change the theme by selecting instead of changing system setting. Next, we'll extend this feature to support an \"auto\" option that respects system preferences , just like phase 0.\n\n### A Note About Generated CSS and Browser Compatibility\n\nTailwind v4 beta generates dark mode utilities using modern CSS nesting syntax:\n\n```\n\n.dark\\:text-white {\n\n&:where([data-theme=\"dark\"], [data-theme=\"dark\"] *) {\n\ncolor: var(--color-white);\n\n\n\n```\n\nAs CSS nesting is a relatively new feature, there are ongoing discussions about browser compatibility in the Tailwind community (see GitHub issue #14753). Since v4 is in beta, this implementation might change based on community feedback and compatibility concerns.\n\n\u2026\n\nif (theme !== 'auto') {\n\ndocument.documentElement.dataset.theme = theme;\n\nreturn;\n\n\n\n// For auto mode, we need to watch system preferences\n\nconst mediaQuery = window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)');\n\n// Set initial theme based on system preference\n\ndocument.documentElement.dataset.theme = mediaQuery.matches ?\n\n\u2026\n\nNow we expand our select component to include the auto option:\n\n```\n\nexport function ThemeSelect() {\n\nconst { theme, setTheme } = useTheme();\n\nreturn (\n\n<select\n\nvalue={theme}\n\nonChange={(e) => setTheme(e.target.value)}\n\n\n\n<option value=\"light\">Light</option>\n\n<option value=\"dark\">Dark</option>\n\n<option value=\"auto\">Auto</option>\n\n</select>\n\n);\n\n\n\n```\n\n\u2026\n\nA critical aspect is ensuring we have a valid theme value before the component even mounts by separating the initial theme logic into\n\n`getInitialTheme`, and pass it directly to\n\n`useState`. This prevents any potential flash of incorrect theme during the initial render.\n\nNow user preferences can persist across browser sessions, creating a more consistent and personalized experience. Whether a user prefers explicit light/dark modes or automatic system-based switching, their choice will be remembered the next time they visit our site.\n\n\u2026\n\n`useTheme` hook:\n\n```\n\nimport { useTheme } from 'next-themes'\n\nexport function ThemeSelect() {\n\nconst { theme, setTheme } = useTheme();\n\nreturn (\n\n<select\n\nvalue={theme}\n\nonChange={(e) => setTheme(e.target.value)}\n\n\n\n<option value=\"light\">Light</option>\n\n<option value=\"dark\">Dark</option>\n\n<option value=\"auto\">Auto</option>\n\n</select>\n\n);\n\n\n\n```",

          "snippet": "**Hyrox** (stylized as **HYROX**) is an indoor fitness competition that combines 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) of running and 8 functional workout stations, alternating between running and functional exercises. It bills itself as \"The World Series of Fitness Racing\" and \"A Sport for Every body\".\n\nA Hyrox competition is made up of a 1-kilometre (0.62\u00a0mi) run followed by a functional exercise station that is repeated eight times for the eight different workout stations. The events are standardized across all locations, allowing athletes to compare results globally.\n\nHyrox was launched by Christian Toetzke and Moritz F\u00fcrste. The first Hyrox event was held in Hamburg, Germany in April 2018.\n\n## History\n\nHyrox was founded by Olympic field hockey champion Moritz F\u00fcrste and Christian Toetzke, and first introduced in Hamburg, Germany in 2017. With the idea of developing a program that would stimulate gym goers and avid Strava users, Furste and Toetzke designed a race of \"eight 1km runs with a workout station in between each 1km \u2013 in no particular order.\" It would also motivate gym users to move past losing weight and checking their body status.\n\nThe first Hyrox event had 650 participants. According to F\u00fcrste, the original brief was \"to create an event that is a \u20ac200,000 (about $214,000) production that looks like a \u20ac2,000,000 ($2,144,000) production\". The name \"Hyrox\" is a portmanteau of \"hybrid\" and \"rockstar.\"\n\nThe competition has since expanded worldwide, with 24,000 people taking part in Hyrox events in London alone in 2023. In total, 65 races were held around the world in 2023, with 175,000 competitors taking part.\n\n### Hyrox affiliates\n\nA network of Hyrox-affiliated gyms has been established, and gyms pay a yearly affiliation fee to become a Hyrox affiliate. There are three tiers of affiliation: Hyrox Performance Centers, Hyrox Training Clubs, and Hyrox Performance Academy. Hyrox365 is responsible for the training and education side of Hyrox. The number of Hyrox-affiliated gyms grew rapidly, and reached 5,000 by the end of 2024.\n\n### Sponsorship and prize money\n\nBy season 3 of Hyrox (2020\u20132021) it had attracted investments from Infront Sports & Media Group and sponsorships by global brands Red Bull and Puma. Prize money for the elite event has grown year on year. Other major events have received prize payouts in addition to the World Championships. For the 2023\u20132024 Hyrox World Championship, the total prize purse was $150,000 split between the male and female elite fields, with the winner receiving $25,000.\n\nIn 2024, Hyrox announced a relay event with representatives from 20 different countries as captains, with the freedom to pick their teams from any athlete of that country. At the World Championships in Nice, France, the relay will take place as the final event with the winning team taking home $20,000 in prize money ($5,000 per athlete).\n\n## Format\n\nHyrox combines running with functional exercise stations, where participants run 1\u00a0km (0.62\u00a0mi), followed by one functional exercise station, repeated eight times. Each race is hosted indoors in exhibition halls or convention centers. Occasional events have been hosted outdoors, including Miami in 2023. The world\u2019s first fully equipped outdoor HYROX Gym was built at Club La Santa in Lanzarote (Spain) in May 2024\n\nThis race format remains consistent across the globe, enabling global leaderboards and a cumulative World Championships at the end of each race season. At the event's functional exercise stations, participants are required to complete the following:\n\n- 1 kilometer of running into 1 kilometer of SkiErg\n- 1 kilometer of running into 50 meters of sled push\n- 1 kilometer of running into 50 meters of sled pull\n- 1 kilometer of running into 80 meters of burpee broad jump\n- 1 kilometer of running into 1 kilometer of rowing\n- 1 kilometer of running into 200 meters of kettlebell farmer carry\n- 1 kilometer of running into 100 meters of sandbag walking lunge\n- 1 kilometer of running into 100 wall balls\n\nAll participants complete the running and stations. Station weights and repetitions can differ based on the division.\n\n## Hyrox workouts\n\nAthletes preparing for Hyrox competitions usually train either at home or in CrossFit or functional fitness gyms that provide access to specialized equipment such as SkiErgs, RowErgs, Kettlebells, Sandbags, sleds, wall balls, and dumbbells. These pieces of equipment help simulate the strength, endurance, and conditioning challenges athletes face during the actual Hyrox race. Since the event combines functional movements with endurance running, training sessions often blend high-intensity cardio with strength-based exercises to build total-body performance.\n\nA typical Hyrox-style workout begins with what\u2019s known as a \"buy-in\" exercise \u2014 a foundational movement or endurance component that sets the tone for the rest of the session. This is followed by three or four additional exercises, performed in multiple rounds to build stamina and test recovery under fatigue. The goal is to maintain consistent effort while managing heart rate and proper form throughout the workout.\n\nExamples of Hyrox-style workouts include:\n\n- Buy-in: 1000-meter row Then: 3 rounds of 10 wall balls, 10 kettlebell swings, and 20-meter sled pushes.\n- Buy-in: 800-meter run Then: 4 rounds of 10 sandbag lunges, 10 burpee broad jumps, and 15-calorie SkiErg.\n- Buy-in: 500-meter SkiErg Then: 3 rounds of 20 air squats, 10 push-ups, and a 100-meter farmer\u2019s carry.\n\nThese workouts not only mirror the physical demands of Hyrox but also help athletes develop mental toughness, pacing awareness, and efficient transitions between movements\u2014key elements for achieving faster race times and stronger overall performance.\n\n## Hyrox competitions\n\nMany Hyrox competitions are held around the world every year, and no qualification is required for athletes to join these competitions. Competitors may compete as a single, or in doubles as a two-person team, or in a team relay. There are four divisions: women, women pro, men, and men pro. For doubles, there are doubles women, doubles men and doubles mixed.\n\nSome of the larger weekend events are extended to two- or three-day affairs. The largest single-day event took place in Birmingham, UK, with 5,032 total finishers. The only event with more participants was the two-day event in London in 2022 that had 6,270 participants.\n\nA number of important championships are held every year, including the European Championships and the North America Championships, but the most important one is the Hyrox World Championships.\n\n### World Championships\n\n#### Elite qualification system\n\nCompetitors can qualify for the World Championships by becoming one of the Elite 15 in Individual Pro races. Those with the best time in the Pro division in a global leaderboard receive an invitation to the Elite race series such as the European Championships and the North America Championships. The podium finishers in these competitions qualify for the elite races in the World Championship.\n\nThe first Hyrox World Championships was held in Oberhausen, Germany, in 2019, with over 600 participants. For season 1 in 2019, the World Championships Elite race was determined solely by the fastest times of the season up to that point.\n\nThe season 2 races in 2020 were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The official World Championships for that season had a condensed field that included the top 5 times of each gender plus one wild card invite of each gender. The wild card invites were from sport adjacent athletes and included Samantha Briggs (2013 CrossFit Games Champion) and Adam Klink (first male to squat 500-lbs and run a sub-5 minute mile in the same day).\n\nFor seasons 3, 4, and 5 (2021\u20132023), athletes qualified by placing top 3 at either the U.S. Championships or the European Championships. The remaining slots were filled in by the top times of the season.\n\nIn season 6 (2023\u20132024), in order to qualify for the World Championships, athletes needed to place top 3 in one of four \"Major Championships\" where roll down slots would happen for athletes who already qualified but never passed 5th place. All remaining spots are filled in by two \"Last Chance Qualifier\" events, where the first one chronologically will have less available spots than the later one. Qualification for the four major events is based on automatic qualifiers from previous seasons (U.S. Champion, European Champion, Top 3 at World Championships) and the remaining spots are filled in based on time from Pro Division events.\n\nThe average finishing time for the men in the Pro division was 1 hour and 22 minutes in 2025.\n\nIn the 2024\u20132025 season, Hyrox introduced Elite 15 divisions for Men's and Women's Pro Doubles for the first time. Similar to the individual Elite 15 format, the top-performing doubles teams from the Pro division leaderboard, along with qualifiers from major championship events, were invited to compete in a final championship heat at the World Championships. Mixed Doubles did not feature an Elite 15 division in this season; champions were determined by overall fastest time.\n\n## Champions by year\n\nThe World Champions of each season are listed here:\n\n### Pro/Elite Men & Women\n\n**World Champions**\n|Season|Year|Location|Female Champion|Female Winning Time (h:mm:ss)|Male Champion|Male Winning time (h:mm:ss)|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|1|2018\u20132019|Oberhausen, Germany|Imke Salander|1:08:08 (WR)|Lukas Storath|0:59:07|\n|2|2019\u20132020*|Hamburg, Germany|Lauren Weeks|1:09:47|Hunter McIntyre|1:00:04|\n|3|2021|Leipzig, Germany|Lauren Weeks (x2)|1:03:43 (WR)|Tobias Lautwein|1:00:00|\n|4|2021\u20132022|Las Vegas, U.S.|Kris Rugloski|1:07:21|Hunter McIntyre (x2)|0:58:05|\n|5|2022\u20132023|Manchester, UK|Lauren Weeks (x3)|0:59:51|Hunter McIntyre (x3)|0:56:40|\n|6|2023\u20132024|Nice, France|Megan Jacoby|0:59:59|Alexander Roncevic|0:56:21|\n|7|2024\u20132025|Chicago, USA|Linda Meier|0:58:56|Tim Wenisch|0:53:53|\n\n\u2022 2020 was run on Assault Fitness AirRunners due to COVID-19 restrictions\n\n### Pro/Elite Doubles (Men's, Women's & Mixed)\n|Season|Year|Location|Womens Doubles Champions|Womens Doubles Winning Time (h:mm:ss)|Mens Doubles Champions|Mens Doubles Winning time (h:mm:ss)|Mixed Doubles Champions|Mixed Doubles Winning Time (h:mm:ss)|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|1|2018\u20132019|Oberhausen, Germany|Manuela Staelberg Marisa Staelberg|1:04:07|Johannes Neusser Martin Dambauer|0:56:15|Julien Hagel Claudia Wipfler|0:56:56|\n|2|2019\u20132020*|*No Doubles Race was held due to COVID-19 Restrictions*|*No Doubles Race was held due to COVID-19 Restrictions*|*No Doubles Race was held due to COVID-19 Restrictions*|*No Doubles Race was held due to COVID-19 Restrictions*|*No Doubles Race was held due to COVID-19 Restrictions*|*No Doubles Race was held due to COVID-19 Restrictions*|*No Doubles Race was held due to COVID-19 Restrictions*|\n|3|2021|Leipzig, Germany|Bente Pries Agnes Schulz|1:04:19|Christoph Uhl Holger K\u00f6rner|0:51:03|Julien Hagel (x2) Claudia Wipfler (x2)|0:57:46|\n|4|2021\u20132022|Las Vegas, U.S.|Aileen McCann Tahlia Britton|1:01:25|Clemens Scherbel Christopher von Stelzer|0:51:26|Lauren Rantala Marc Howe|0:57:13|\n|5|2022\u20132023|Manchester, UK|Rebecca Naether Mirjam Von Rohr|1:00:36|Taylor Haney Colin Stiefer|0:54:29|Jacqueline Lippenmeyer Florian Lippenmeyer|0:55:51|\n|6|2023\u20132024|Nice, France|Kate Davey Zara Piergianni|0:57:59|Jake Dearden Marc Dean|0:52:34|Fabien Eisenlauer Jennifer Nikolaus|0:53:08|\n|7|2024\u20132025**|Chicago, USA|Lauren Griffith Lauren Weeks|0:54:58|Tim Wenisch Jannik Czapla|0:50:24|M\u00e9v\u00e9na Pingliez Quentin Pingliez**|0:54:06|\n\n*2020 was canceled for doubles due to COVID-19 Restrictions\n\n**The 2024\u20132025 season was the first to feature Elite 15 Men's and Women's Doubles races at the World Championships.

This guide covers\n\n**scroll-linked** animations, **scroll-triggered** animations, **parallax**, **horizontal scrolling**, and more. All with live examples and copy-paste code.\n\n## Types of scroll animation\n\nThere are two fundamental types of scroll animations:\n\n**Scroll-triggered:**An animation is triggered when an element enters or leaves the viewport. Common for fade-in effects and lazy-loading. **Scroll-linked:**Animation values are linked directly to scroll position. Used for parallax, progress bars, and interactive storytelling.\n\nMotion supports both types of scroll animations with simple, performant APIs.\n\n## Scroll-triggered animations\n\nScroll-triggered animations fire when an element enters or leaves the viewport, or scrolls to a specific point in the viewport.\n\nMotion provides the\n\n`whileInView` prop to set an animation target.\n\n<motion.div initial={{ opacity: 0 }} whileInView={{ opacity: 1 }} />\n\n### Animate once on scroll\n\nBy default, elements will animate between\n\n`initial`/\n\n`animate`, and\n\n`whileInView`, as the element enters and leaves the viewport. Via the\n\n`viewport` options, set\n\n`once: true` so an animation only plays the first time an element scrolls into view.\n\n<motion.div initial=\"hidden\" whileInView=\"visible\" viewport={{ once: true }} />\n\n### Changing scroll container\n\nBy default, animations will trigger based on the\n\n`window` viewport. To set a custom scroll container element, pass the\n\n`ref` of another scrollable element to the\n\n`root` option:\n\nfunction Component() { const scrollRef = useRef(null) return ( <div ref={scrollRef} style={{ overflow: \"scroll\" }}> <motion.div initial={{ opacity: 0 }} whileInView={{ opacity: 1 }} viewport={{ root: scrollRef }} /> </div> ) }\n\nFor more configuration options, checkout the\n\n`motion` component API reference.\n\n### Setting state\n\nIt's also possible to set React state when any element (not just a\n\n`motion` component) enters and leaves the viewport with the\n\n`useInView` hook.\n\nfunction Component() { const ref = useRef(null) const isInView = useInView(ref) return ( <div ref={ref}> {isInView ? \"Hello!\" : \"Bye...\"} </div> ) }\n\n## Scroll-linked animations\n\nScroll-linked animations connect CSS styles directly to scroll position. In Motion, this is done with the\n\n`useScroll` hook.\n\n`useScroll` returns four motion values:\n\n`scrollX`/\n\n`scrollY`: Scroll position in pixels\n\n`scrollXProgress`/\n\n`scrollYProgress`: Scroll progress from\n\n`0`to\n\n`1`\n\n### Scroll progress bar\n\nCreate a reading progress indicator by linking\n\n`scrollYProgress` to\n\n`scaleX`:\n\nconst { scrollYProgress } = useScroll(); return ( <motion.div style={{ scaleX: scrollYProgress, originX: 0 }} /> )\n\n### Detect scroll direction\n\nIt's possible to track scroll direction by using\n\n`useMotionValueEvent` on\n\n`scrollY`. With this, it's possible to animate items to different states, like a menu that only shows as we scroll down.\n\nconst { scrollY } = useScroll() const [scrollDirection, setScrollDirection] = useState(\"down\") useMotionValueEvent(scrollY, \"change\", (current) => { const diff = current - scrollY.getPrevious() setScrollDirection(diff > 0 ? \"down\" : \"up\") })\n\n### Smoothing scroll values\n\nSmooth changes to a scroll value by passing one through\n\n`useSpring`:\n\nconst { scrollYProgress } = useScroll(); const scaleX = useSpring(scrollYProgress, { stiffness: 100, damping: 30, restDelta: 0.001 }) return <motion.div style={{ scaleX }} />\n\n### Transform scroll position to any value\n\nUse the\n\n`useTransform` hook to map scroll progress to colours, positions, or any other CSS value:\n\nconst filter = useTransform( scrollYProgress, [0, 1], [\"blur(0px)\", \"blur(10px)\"] ) return <motion.div style={{ filter }} />\n\n### Track element scroll position through viewport\n\nBy default,\n\n`useScroll` progress values will represent the overall viewport scroll (or element scroll).\n\nBy passing an element via the\n\n`target` option,\n\n`scrollYProgress` will return its progress through the visible space.\n\nconst ref = useRef(null) const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll({ target: ref, /* When the top of the target meets the bottom of the container to when the bottom of the target meets the top of the container */ offset: [\"start end\", \"end start\"] })\n\n### Parallax scrolling\n\nParallax creates the illusion of depth by moving elements at different speeds. Background layers should move slower than foreground layers:\n\nconst { foregroundY, backgroundY } = useTransform( scrollY, [0, 1], { foregroundY: [0, 2], // move 2px for every 1 scroll px backgroundY: [0, 0.5] // move 0.5px for every 1 scroll px }, { clamp: false } )\n\n### Scroll image reveal effect\n\nBy linking\n\n`clipPath` to\n\n`scrollYProgress`, you can have an image \"reveal\" itself as it scrolls into view.\n\nconst ref = useRef(null) const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll({ target: ref, offset: [\"start end\", \"center center\"] }) const clipPath = useTransform( scrollYProgress, [0, 1], [\"inset(0% 50% 0% 50%)\", \"inset(0% 0% 0% 0%)\"] ) return ( <motion.div ref={ref} style={{ clipPath }}> <img src=\"/photo.jpg\" alt=\"Revealed image\" /> </motion.div> )\n\n### Horizontal scroll section\n\nYou can make a horizontally-scrolling section by combining\n\n`useScroll`, a tall container section, and a wide\n\n`position: sticky` container.\n\nconst containerRef = useRef(null) const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll({ target: containerRef, offset: [\"start start\", \"end end\"] }) const x = useTransform(scrollYProgress, [0, 1], [\"0%\", \"-75%\"]) return ( <div ref={containerRef} style={{ height: \"300vh\" }}> <div style={{ position: \"sticky\", top: 0, height: \"100vh\", overflow: \"hidden\" }}> <motion.div style={{ x, display: \"flex\", gap: 20 }}> {items.map(item => ( <div key={item.id} style={{ flexShrink: 0, width: 400 }}> {item.content} </div> ))} </motion.div> </div> </div> )\n\nThe container should have a long viewport-relative measurement like\n\n`300vh`. Increasing this length will make the horizontal scrolling feel slower.\n\n### Text scroll\n\nBy combining\n\n`useScroll` with the Motion+\n\n`Ticker` we can make this popular effect where blocks of text scroll horizontally as the page itself scrolls vertically.\n\nBy passing\n\n`scrollY` to\n\n`useTransform` and multiplying it by\n\n`-1` we get a motion value that moves in the opposite direction to the scroll.\n\nconst { scrollY } = useScroll() const invertScroll = useTransform(() => scrollY.get() * -1) const lines = [ { text: \"Creative\", reverse: false }, { text: \"Design\", reverse: true }, { text: \"Motion\", reverse: false }, { text: \"Studio\", reverse: true }, ]\n\n{lines.map((line, index) => ( <Ticker key={line.text} className={`ticker-line ticker-${index}`} items={[ <span className=\"text-solid\">{line.text}</span>, <span className=\"text-outline\">{line.text}</span>, ]} offset={line.reverse ? invertScroll : scrollY} /> ))}\n\n## Examples\n\n#### Track element scroll offset\n\n#### Track element within viewport\n\n#### 3D\n\n#### Scroll velocity and direction\n\nRead the full\n\n`useScroll` docs to discover more about creating the above effects.\n\nLearn how to create scroll animations in React with Motion.

Visual Identity & Tone References\n\n### 1.1 The Two Pillars Defined\n\nUnderstanding the aesthetic requires separating and then deliberately fusing two design vocabularies:\n\n#### \"Raw Industrial\" Design DNA\n| Element | Real-World Reference | Digital Translation |\n|---------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| Exposed steel & concrete | Warehouse gyms, CrossFit boxes, Hyrox venue halls (exhibition centers with raw concrete, rigging, exposed ductwork) | Dark matte surfaces (#0A0A0A\u2013#1A1A1A), subtle grain texture overlays, low-saturation UI |\n| Stencil typography | Equipment labels, military crates, gym floor markings | All-caps condensed headings, letter-spacing tracking, monospaced numerics |\n| Caution/hazard markings | Yellow-black diagonal striping on equipment, safety tape, loading zone markings | Accent color usage pattern \u2014 #FFD700 as \"warning\" highlight, diagonal stripe decorative elements |\n| Exposed grid/structure | Steel I-beams, chain-link, welded frames | Visible grid lines, sharp 90\u00b0 corners on cards, thin 1px borders, exposed layout structure |\n| Raw material finishes | Brushed steel, matte rubber, chalk dust | Subtle noise/grain overlay, matte (not glossy) surfaces, minimal shine |\n\n#### \"Precision Coaching\" Design DNA\n| Element | Real-World Reference | Digital Translation |\n|---------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| Lab instrumentation | Sports science labs, heart-rate displays, VO2max readouts | Monospace numerics for timers/stats, clean data visualization, precise alignment |\n| Performance dashboards | WHOOP strain gauge, Garmin dashboards, race telemetry | Progress rings, stat cards with decimal precision, animated counters |\n| Clinical precision | White-coat lab environments, calibration equipment | Tight grid alignment, mathematical spacing (4px base), consistent typographic scale |\n| Data-dense displays | Race control rooms, timing systems, split boards at events | Information-dense layouts that don't feel cluttered, careful hierarchy |\n| Optic-grade displays | Fighter jet HUDs, automotive gauge clusters | Monospace fonts for data, accent-colored data points, subtle glow on active metrics |\n\n### 1.2 Reference Apps & How They Balance the Spectrum\n\n**WHOOP (Primarily Precision, Touch of Raw)**\n- Deep black background (#000000) with elevation via subtle surface lightening\n- Strain gauge as signature element \u2014 a circular progress ring that fills from green \u2192 yellow \u2192 red\n- Data-first philosophy: large monospace numbers, small labels\n- Animation: smooth counter animations, circular gauge fills on load\n- *Lesson:* Their circular strain gauge is instantly recognizable. Our app needs an equivalent signature element.\n\n**Nike Training Club / Nike Run Club (Balanced)**\n- Trade Gothic Bold Condensed for headers \u2014 the quintessential athletic stencil feel\n- Minimal color palette: black + white + one accent per context\n- Full-bleed imagery with text overlay \u2014 cinematic feeling\n- Clean iconography, functional and waypoint-oriented\n- *Lesson:* NTC proves condensed bold type + minimal color = powerful athletic identity.\n\n**Freeletics (More Raw)**\n- Dark backgrounds, aggressive typography, high-energy feel\n- Workout cards with sharp edges, bold numbering\n- Less data visualization, more motivational/action-oriented\n- *Lesson:* Raw energy works for motivation screens, but needs precision balance for training data.\n\n**Strava (Primarily Precision)**\n- Clean white/dark UI with segment data, charts, route maps\n- Detailed split tables, elevation profiles, performance analytics\n- Orange accent for premium/active states\n- *Lesson:* Shows how to make data-dense screens feel inviting through spacing and hierarchy.\n\n**PUSH Band / Velocity-Based Training Apps (Deep Precision)**\n- Minimal UI focused on real-time data: velocity, power, force curves\n- Dark backgrounds with neon accent colors on live data\n- Scientific visualization aesthetic\n- *Lesson:* The \"instrument panel\" feeling where every pixel serves a data purpose.\n\n### 1.3 Hyrox Event Venue Aesthetic\n\nFrom researching Hyrox events (held in exhibition halls like ExCeL London, Oval Lingotto Turin, McCormick Place Chicago):\n- **Massive indoor spaces** with industrial infrastructure \u2014 exposed ceiling rigging, concrete floors\n- **Hyrox brand colors**: Black, white, and a bold yellow-gold accent\n- **Event signage**: Large stencil-style station numbers, LED timing boards, clear wayfinding\n- **Atmosphere**: Fog machines, dramatic lighting, loud music \u2014 a concert-meets-competition energy\n- **Race format visualization**: The 8-station sequential format (alternating run + station) is the core identity \u2014 always represented as a linear sequence or circuit\n\n---\n\n## 2. Typography System\n\n### 2.1 Requirements Matrix\n\n| Role | Character | Technical Needs |\n|------|-----------|----------------|\n| **Display/Heading** | Raw, industrial, commanding \u2014 stencil/gym wall energy | All-caps support, condensed widths, heavy weights, Google Fonts |\n| **Body** | Precise, technical, highly legible \u2014 instrument panel clarity | Good x-height, clear l/I/1 distinction, multiple weights, Google Fonts |\n| **Monospace/Data** | Digital readout, timer display, lab instrument | Tabular numerals, clear at small sizes, Google Fonts |\n\n### 2.2 Font Analysis\n\n#### Display Font Candidates (Ranked)\n\n**1. Barlow Condensed (Bold/ExtraBold/Black)**\n- **Why it fits:** Designed by Jeremy Tribby as a grotesk inspired by California's freeway signage \u2014 inherently industrial and built for wayfinding at speed. The condensed width packs power into tight spaces. In Black weight, it feels like stenciled equipment labels. UC Berkeley uses it as their athletic condensed font for exactly this reason.\n- **Condensed width:** Allows long station names (\"BURPEE BROAD JUMP\") to fit on one line\n- **Weight range:** Thin to Black (9 weights + italics) \u2014 enormous flexibility\n- **Google Fonts:** \u2705 Free, open source\n- **Verdict:** \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 \u2014 Top recommendation. The freeway/industrial signage heritage is perfect.\n\n**2. Bebas Neue**\n- **Why it fits:** The internet's most-used display condensed \u2014 essentially the digital version of the Impact family, but better proportioned. Ultra-condensed, all-caps by design. Feels like gym wall typography, race bibs, and competition signage.\n- **Limitation:** Only one weight (Regular) on Google Fonts \u2014 no bold/light variations\n- **Google Fonts:** \u2705 \n- **Verdict:** \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 \u2014 Stunning but inflexible. Works if only used at very large sizes.\n\n**3. Teko**\n- **Why it fits:** A Devanagari + Latin family with a distinctly engineered, squared character. The geometric construction gives it a technical precision that matches military/industrial contexts. Slightly wider than Bebas Neue.\n- **Weight range:** Light to Bold (5 weights)\n- **Google Fonts:** \u2705\n- **Verdict:** \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 \u2014 Great geometric-industrial option with good weight range.\n\n**4. Chakra Petch**\n- **Why it fits:** Categorized as \"Modern/Techno\" \u2014 a square sans-serif with subtly tapered/clipped corners that evoke digital displays, circuit boards, and technical instrumentation. Bridges the gap between raw industrial and futuristic precision.\n- **Weight range:** Light to Bold (6 weights + italics)\n- **Google Fonts:** \u2705\n- **Verdict:** \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 \u2014 The tapered corners add a unique \"precision tech\" character. Excellent for secondary headings and station labels.\n\n**5. Rajdhani**\n- **Why it fits:** Geometric, angular letterforms with a distinct squared quality. Feels like instrument panel labeling or engineering diagram annotations.\n- **Weight range:** Light to Bold (5 weights)\n- **Google Fonts:** \u2705\n- **Verdict:** \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 \u2014 Good secondary option, slightly less commanding than Barlow Condensed.\n\n**Other reviewed:** Oswald (good but overused), Anton (too heavy, one weight), Saira/Saira Condensed (interesting semi-condensed with a motorsport feel), Orbitron (too sci-fi/futuristic for industrial aesthetic).\n\n#### Body Font Candidates (Ranked)\n\n**1. IBM Plex Sans**\n- **Why it fits:** Designed by IBM for user interfaces \u2014 the name alone signals \"precision engineering.\" Inspired by American gothics (Franklin Gothic, Trade Gothic) but refined for screen clarity. Has a seriffed uppercase I and tailed lowercase l \u2014 critical for data-heavy UIs where l/I/1 confusion kills trust.\n- **The IBM heritage** evokes mainframes, instrument panels, and technical documentation \u2014 perfect for \"precision coaching\" DNA\n- **Weight range:** Thin to Bold (7 weights + italics + condensed)\n- **Google Fonts:** \u2705\n- **Verdict:** \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 \u2014 Top recommendation. The engineering pedigree is unmatched.\n\n**2. DM Sans**\n- **Why it fits:** A geometric sans-serif with generous optical sizing. Clean, modern, and highly legible. Less \"engineering\" character than IBM Plex but more neutral/universal.\n- **Weight range:** Variable (100\u20131000)\n- **Google Fonts:** \u2705\n- **Verdict:** \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 \u2014 Excellent fallback. Very clean but perhaps too \"friendly\" for industrial aesthetic.\n\n**3. Titillium Web**\n- **Why it fits:** Born from an academic project at Accademia di Belle Arti di Urbino \u2014 has a distinctly European technical/engineering feel. Used in motorsport contexts and technical documentation.\n- **Weight range:** ExtraLight to Black (9 weights + italics)\n- **Google Fonts:** \u2705\n- **Verdict:** \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 \u2014 Strong runner-up with authentic technical DNA.\n\n**4. Exo 2**\n- **Why it fits:** A geometric sans-serif designed for screen clarity with a slightly futuristic quality. Clean and precise without being cold.\n- **Google Fonts:** \u2705\n- **Verdict:** \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 \u2014 Good but lacks the distinctive engineering character of IBM Plex.\n\n#### Monospace/Data Font Candidates\n\n**1. JetBrains Mono (already selected)**\n- **Why it fits:** Designed for developers \u2014 supreme clarity at small sizes, ligature support, distinct character shapes. The \"code readout\" feeling is perfect for performance data.\n- **Tabular numerals:** \u2705 All characters same width \u2014 critical for timer displays\n- **Google Fonts:** \u2705\n- **Verdict:** \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 \u2014 Confirmed. Keep this selection.\n\n**2. Space Mono**\n- **Why it fits:** Has more personality/character than JetBrains Mono \u2014 slightly quirky letterforms evoke vintage computer terminals and old instrument readouts.\n- **Google Fonts:** \u2705 (but only Regular + Bold)\n- **Verdict:** \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 \u2014 Could work for large timer displays where character > clarity.\n\n**3. IBM Plex Mono**\n- **Why it fits:** Pairs perfectly with IBM Plex Sans body \u2014 consistent design language. Same engineering heritage.\n- **Google Fonts:** \u2705\n- **Verdict:** \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 \u2014 Best choice if using IBM Plex Sans as body font for family cohesion.\n\n### 2.3 Recommended Pairings\n\n#### Pairing A: \"The Competition Board\" (Primary Recommendation)\n\n| Role | Font | Weight(s) | Why |\n|------|------|-----------|-----|\n| **Display** | **Barlow Condensed** | Bold (700), ExtraBold (800), Black (900) | Freeway signage industrial DNA, military precision, wide weight range for hierarchy |\n| **Body** | **IBM Plex Sans** | Regular (400), Medium (500), SemiBold (600) | Engineering instrument panel clarity, IBM technical heritage, superior l/I/1 distinction |\n| **Data/Mono** | **JetBrains Mono** | Regular (400), Bold (700) | Developer-grade clarity, tabular numerics, digital readout aesthetic |\n\n**Rationale:** This pairing creates a clear spectrum from raw (Barlow Condensed screaming in ALL CAPS at the top) through measured precision (IBM Plex Sans in body copy) to digital instrument (JetBrains Mono for data). Each font has a strong functional identity and they never compete visually.\n\n```css\n/* Tailwind CSS v4 \u2014 @theme configuration */\n@theme {\n  --font-display: 'Barlow Condensed', 'Arial Narrow', sans-serif;\n  --font-body: 'IBM Plex Sans', 'Segoe UI', sans-serif;\n  --font-mono: 'JetBrains Mono', 'Fira Code', monospace;\n}\n```\n\n#### Pairing B: \"The Tech Lab\"\n\n| Role | Font | Weight(s) | Why |\n|------|------|-----------|-----|\n| **Display** | **Chakra Petch** | SemiBold (600), Bold (700) | Techno-square with tapered corners \u2014 bridges industrial and precision futurism |\n| **Body** | **IBM Plex Sans** | Regular (400), Medium (500) | Same rationale as above |\n| **Data/Mono** | **IBM Plex Mono** | Regular (400), Bold (700) | Family cohesion with IBM Plex Sans body |\n\n**Rationale:** More cohesive and tech-forward. Chakra Petch's clipped corners suggest circuit boards and digital displays, while IBM Plex maintains the engineering precision. The IBM Plex Mono + Sans pairing creates visual family consistency. This pairing leans more \"precision\" than \"raw.\"\n\n#### Pairing C: \"The Warehouse\"\n\n| Role | Font | Weight(s) | Why |\n|------|------|-----------|-----|\n| **Display** | **Bebas Neue** | Regular (only weight) | Maximum raw industrial impact \u2014 the quintessential gym wall typeface |\n| **Sub-heading** | **Barlow Condensed** | SemiBold (600), Bold (700) | Supplements Bebas Neue where weight variation is needed |\n| **Body** | **Titillium Web** | Regular (400), SemiBold (600) | European technical documentation feel, motorsport heritage |\n| **Data/Mono** | **JetBrains Mono** | Regular (400), Bold (700) | Digital readout clarity |\n\n**Rationale:** Leans hardest into the raw industrial side. Bebas Neue is commanding and unmistakable \u2014 it screams competition signage. Titillium Web grounds the body text with technical European precision. This is the most aggressive/bold option. Requires Barlow Condensed as bridge font since Bebas Neue only has one weight.\n\n### 2.4 Typographic Scale\n\nBased on a 1.250 (Major Third) scale for mobile-first, moving to 1.333 (Perfect Fourth) on desktop:\n\n```css\n@theme {\n  /* Mobile-first type scale (Major Third 1.250) */\n  --text-xs: 0.64rem;     /* 10.24px \u2014 fine print, labels */\n  --text-sm: 0.8rem;      /* 12.8px \u2014 captions, secondary text */\n  --text-base: 1rem;      /* 16px \u2014 body text */\n  --text-lg: 1.25rem;     /* 20px \u2014 large body, card titles */\n  --text-xl: 1.563rem;    /* 25px \u2014 section headings */\n  --text-2xl: 1.953rem;   /* 31.25px \u2014 page headings */\n  --text-3xl: 2.441rem;   /* 39px \u2014 hero headings */\n  --text-4xl: 3.052rem;   /* 48.8px \u2014 display text */\n  --text-5xl: 3.815rem;   /* 61px \u2014 massive display */\n  \n  /* Timer/Data special sizes */\n  --text-timer: 4.5rem;   /* 72px \u2014 main timer display */\n  --text-stat: 2.5rem;    /* 40px \u2014 stat counters */\n}\n```\n\n### 2.5 Typography Usage Rules\n\n```css\n/* Display headings: Barlow Condensed, ALL CAPS, tight tracking */\n.heading-display {\n  font-family: var(--font-display);\n  text-transform: uppercase;\n  letter-spacing: 0.05em;  /* Slightly expanded for industrial stencil feel */\n  font-weight: 800;\n  line-height: 0.95;       /* Tight leading for impact */\n}\n\n/* Body text: IBM Plex Sans, normal case, relaxed reading */\n.body-text {\n  font-family: var(--font-body);\n  font-weight: 400;\n  line-height: 1.6;\n  letter-spacing: 0.01em;\n}\n\n/* Data/stats: JetBrains Mono, tabular figures */\n.data-text {\n  font-family: var(--font-mono);\n  font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums;\n  letter-spacing: -0.02em;  /* Slightly tighter for instrument feel */\n  font-weight: 400;\n}\n\n/* Timer display: JetBrains Mono at hero size */\n.timer-display {\n  font-family: var(--font-mono);\n  font-size: var(--text-timer);\n  font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums;\n  font-weight: 700;\n  letter-spacing: -0.03em;\n  line-height: 1;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Comprehensive Animation Strategy\n\n### 3.1 Motion Principles for \"Raw Industrial + Precision Coaching\"\n\nThe motion language must reflect **mechanical precision with weight**. Think hydraulic press, not butterfly. Industrial machinery, not organic flow.\n\n| Principle | Description | Anti-Pattern |\n|-----------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Weighted & purposeful** | Elements have mass \u2014 they accelerate and decelerate like heavy objects | Floaty, wispy, ethereal movements |\n| **Sharp & decisive** | Short durations, confident easing \u2014 no hesitation | Long, lazy transitions |\n| **Sequential precision** | Staggered reveals suggest a checklist being completed or stations being activated | Everything appearing simultaneously |\n| **Mechanical rhythm** | Consistent timing patterns \u2014 like a metronome or machine cycle | Random, chaotic timing |\n| **Restrained celebration** | Even celebrations feel controlled \u2014 precision confetti, not party chaos | Over-the-top bouncing, excessive particles |\n\n### 3.2 Easing Curves & Spring Configurations\n\n```typescript\n// === CORE EASING CURVES ===\n\n// \"Industrial Snap\" \u2014 Primary easing for most UI transitions\n// Fast-in, sharp deceleration: like a hydraulic mechanism snapping into place\nconst INDUSTRIAL_SNAP = [0.16, 1, 0.3, 1] as const;\n// Tailwind CSS: transition-[cubic-bezier(0.16,1,0.3,1)]\n\n// \"Precision Ease\" \u2014 For data reveals and chart animations\n// Smooth and measured, like a precision instrument settling\nconst PRECISION_EASE = [0.33, 1, 0.68, 1] as const;\n// Similar to ease-out but with more control at the start\n\n// \"Machine Press\" \u2014 For heavy/impactful animations (modal reveals, drawer opens)\n// Accelerates aggressively, then locks into position\nconst MACHINE_PRESS = [0.22, 0.68, 0, 1] as const;\n\n// === SPRING CONFIGURATIONS ===\n\n// \"Tight Industrial\" \u2014 For micro-interactions (buttons, toggles, small reveals)\nconst SPRING_TIGHT: SpringOptions = {\n  stiffness: 400,\n  damping: 30,\n  mass: 0.8,\n};\n\n// \"Gauge Settle\" \u2014 For progress rings, gauges, counter animations\nconst SPRING_GAUGE: SpringOptions = {\n  stiffness: 120,\n  damping: 20,\n  mass: 1,\n};\n\n// \"Heavy Machinery\" \u2014 For page transitions, large modal reveals\nconst SPRING_HEAVY: SpringOptions = {\n

35,\n  mass: 0.5,\n};\n```\n\n### 3.3 Page Load Orchestration\n\n```typescript\nimport { motion, stagger, useAnimate } from \"motion/react\";\n\n// === STAGGERED PAGE LOAD PATTERN ===\n// Elements appear like a system booting up \u2014 header first, then content blocks\n// in rapid succession, like equipment status lights activating\n\nconst PAGE_LOAD_VARIANTS = {\n  hidden: { opacity: 0 },\n  visible: {\n    opacity: 1,\n    transition: {\n      staggerChildren: 0.06,  // 60ms stagger \u2014 fast, mechanical rhythm\n      delayChildren: 0.1,     // 100ms initial delay\n    },\n  },\n};\n\nconst ITEM_VARIANTS = {\n  hidden: { \n    opacity: 0, \n    y: 12,           // Small vertical offset \u2014 subtle, not dramatic\n    filter: \"blur(4px)\"  // Slight blur for \"focusing

</motion.div>\n```\n\n**Direction logic:**\n- **Top-level navigation/header:** Slides down from top (`y: -20 \u2192 0`)\n- **Content cards:** Fade up from below (`y: 12 \u2192 0`)  \n- **Side panels/drawers:** Slide from respective edge (`x: \u00b1300 \u2192 0`)\n- **Modals:** Scale up from center with opacity (`scale: 0.95, opacity: 0 \u2192 scale: 1, opacity: 1`)\n- **Data values:** No movement, just opacity + blur clear (`opacity: 0, filter: blur(4px) \u2192 1, blur(0)`)\n\n### 3.4 Scroll-Triggered Animations\n\n```typescript\nimport { motion, useScroll, useTransform, useSpring }

\u2705 **Animate:** Stat cards, achievement badges, chart containers, section headings, image reveals\n- \u2705 **Scroll-linked:** Progress bars, parallax backgrounds, header opacity changes\n- \u274c **Keep static:** Navigation elements, active timers, critical data readouts, form inputs during use\n- \u274c **Never animate on scroll:** Content the user needs to read immediately, interactive

Map routes animate along the path.\n- **Best practice:** Data should animate on first view only (viewport: once), use PRECISION_EASE for data (not bouncy springs), and complete within 1.5s total for any data visualization sequence.\n\n### 3.7 AI Chat Streaming Text\n\n```typescript\n// === AI STREAMING TEXT: Premium typewriter effect ===\n// Each word/chunk fades in with slight upward motion\n//

**15\u201320** on desktop | Beyond this, frame drops begin on mid-range mobile devices |\n| Animation properties | **Only `transform` and `opacity`** for scroll-linked; `clipPath`, `filter` acceptable for triggered | These are GPU-composited; avoid `width`, `height`, `top`, `left` |\n| Max stagger children | **12\u201315 items** before switching to group animation | Staggering 30+ items creates long sequences that feel slow |\n| Stagger interval | **40\u201380ms** per item | Below 40ms feels like no stagger; above 100ms feels sluggish |\n| Total animation sequence | **< 1.5s** for any load sequence | Users perceive > 2s as slow |\n| Scroll-linked update rate | Use **`ScrollTimeline` API** via Motion's `useScroll` | Hardware-accelerated, doesn't run on main thread |\n| `backdrop-filter: blur()` | **Max 2 simultaneous** on mobile | Expensive compositor operation \u2014 each costs ~2ms per frame |\n| `will-change: transform` | Apply to **actively animating elements only**, remove after | Prevents compositor layer explosion |\n| Reduced motion | **Always respect `prefers-reduced-motion`** | Replace animations with instant state changes or opacity-only fades |\n\n```typescript\n//
