Most athletes never think about it until they're gasping at station 6. Here's your complete station-by-station breathing guide.\n\n**Station 1: SkiErg (1000m)**\nExhale forcefully on the pull phase as you hinge down. Inhale on the recovery as you stand back up. Maintain a **1:1 ratio** \u2014 one full breath cycle per stroke. Establish this pattern within the first 5-10 strokes and lock it in. The SkiErg is rhythmic by nature, so your breathing should match the rhythm. If you lose the pattern, slow your stroke rate for 3-4 strokes until you regain it.\n\n**Station 2: Sled Push (4 x 12.5m)**\nContinuous short exhales with each driving step \u2014 almost like a \"huh, huh, huh\" pattern. **Never hold your breath.** Breath-holding during heavy pushing (Valsalva maneuver) spikes blood pressure and heart rate unnecessarily. Keep air moving in and out with rapid, shallow breaths synchronized to your foot strikes. Inhale naturally between exhales \u2014 don't overthink the inhale, just don't hold.\n\n**Station 3: Sled Pull (4 x 12.5m)**\nExhale on each pull as you drive your hips back. Inhale between pulls during the brief reset. If you're using the hip extension method, the breathing pattern mirrors a kettlebell swing \u2014 sharp exhale on exertion, controlled inhale on reset. Keep pulls rapid and rhythmic, and your breathing will follow.\n\n**Station 4: Burpee Broad Jump (80m)**\nExhale on the jump phase as you leave the ground. Inhale during the descent to the ground for the burpee portion. This is the hardest station to maintain breathing rhythm because the movement is complex and fatiguing. **The key cue: breathe OUT as you jump, breathe IN as you go down.** If you start holding your breath, you'll gas out 20 reps earlier than you should.\n\n**Station 5: Rowing (1000m)**\nExhale on the drive phase as your legs push. Inhale on the recovery as you slide forward. This mirrors the SkiErg pattern \u2014 one breath cycle per stroke. The recovery phase is your micro-rest, so make the inhale slow and controlled. A **2:1 recovery-to-drive ratio** gives you more time to breathe in than out, which naturally lowers heart rate.\n\n**Station 6: Farmer Carry (200m)**\nThis is the one station where **rhythmic nasal breathing is ideal** if you can manage it. Nasal breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system and helps keep heart rate down \u2014 which is exactly what you need during a carry. Breathe in sync with your steps: inhale for 3-4 steps, exhale for 3-4 steps. If nasal breathing isn't sustainable, switch to controlled mouth breathing with the same step-count rhythm. Avoid gasping or panting \u2014 this station should be your heart rate recovery opportunity.\n\n**Station 7: Sandbag Lunges (200m)**\nExhale on the stand-up phase of each lunge (the concentric effort). Inhale as you step forward and lower into the next lunge (the eccentric phase). The lunges are slow enough that you can establish a deliberate breathing cadence. One full breath cycle per lunge rep.\n\n**Station 8: Wall Balls (100 reps)**\nExhale on the throw as you drive the ball upward. Inhale on the catch as you absorb the ball and descend into the squat. This is the most natural pattern because the exertion (throw) aligns with the exhale. Establish it from rep 1 and maintain it through your break sets. When you rest between sets, take exactly 3 deep diaphragmatic breaths before resuming.\n\n**The universal rule across all stations:** If you catch yourself holding your breath, you need to consciously reset. Slow down for 2-3 reps, re-establish the breathing pattern, then build back up. Holding your breath is the fastest way to spike heart rate and induce early fatigue."}]}

How do I fix this?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The number one mistake \u2014 and I see this constantly \u2014 is **holding your breath during exertion.** Breath-holding triggers a Valsalva response that spikes heart rate and blood pressure, causing premature fatigue. Your muscles need a continuous supply of oxygen, and every second you hold your breath, you're creating an oxygen debt that compounds.\n\n**The immediate fix:** Practice breathing DURING effort, not between efforts. Every station has a natural breathing rhythm tied to the movement pattern \u2014 exhale on exertion, inhale on recovery. The specific pattern depends on which station is giving you trouble.\n\n**The deeper fix depends on which station is the problem:**\n\n- **SkiErg or Rowing:** You're probably pulling too fast with a stroke rate above 35+ SPM. Slow down, lengthen each stroke, and lock in one breath per stroke cycle. Power per stroke matters more than stroke rate.\n- **Sled Push:** You're likely holding your breath against the load. Switch to continuous short exhales with each driving step \u2014 \"huh, huh, huh\" \u2014 like a boxer throwing punches.\n- **Sled Pull:** Same issue \u2014 breath-holding on heavy pulls. Exhale sharply on each pull, inhale between pulls.\n- **Burpee Broad Jumps:** The most common breathing disaster station. The complex movement disrupts any rhythm. Simplify: exhale on jump, inhale on descent. If that's too hard to maintain, just focus on NOT holding your breath.\n- **Wall Balls:** Athletes hold their breath in the squat. Exhale on the throw, inhale on the catch. Every rep.\n\n**The training prescription:** In your next three station practice sessions, set the weight or resistance at 60-70% of race intensity and focus ENTIRELY on breathing rhythm. Don't worry about times. Once the breathing pattern is automatic at low intensity, gradually increase to race pace. Breathing under load is a skill \u2014 it needs deliberate practice.\n\n**Also check your running.** If you're arriving at each station already redlined from the 1km run, your breathing will never recover at the station. Slow your inter-station runs by 15-20 seconds per km. The runs are transitions, not races."}]}

It filters and humidifies air, promotes diaphragmatic breathing, and activates the parasympathetic nervous system \u2014 all of which help manage heart rate. If you can maintain nasal breathing during the 1km runs, you're at the right intensity for those segments.\n- **Above Zone 2:** Once intensity increases, mouth breathing is natural and necessary. Don't fight it. Your body needs more oxygen throughput than your nasal passages can deliver. Trying to force nasal breathing at high intensity creates an oxygen deficit.\n\n**At stations \u2014 mouth breathing is the default.** The metabolic demand of sled pushes, wall balls, and BBJs is too high for nasal breathing alone. Your body will naturally shift to mouth breathing, and you should let it. Trying to nasal-breathe during a sled push is fighting your physiology.\n\n**The exception: Farmer Carry.** This is the one station where controlled nasal breathing \u2014 or at least calm, rhythmic breathing \u2014 can actually help. The farmer carry is lower intensity relative to other stations, and it's your best opportunity to bring heart rate down before the final two stations (sandbag lunges and wall balls). Breathe in through your nose for 3-4 steps, out through your mouth for 3-4 steps. If full nasal breathing isn't possible, even partial nasal inhales help.\n\n**The practical rule:** Don't be dogmatic about nose vs. mouth. Use nasal breathing when the intensity allows it (easy runs, farmer carry) because it helps regulate heart rate. Switch to mouth breathing when intensity demands it (stations, hard runs). Your body is smarter than any breathing protocol \u2014 listen to it.\n\n**One training hack:** Practice nasal-only running during your Zone 2 sessions. It's both a breathing exercise and a built-in intensity governor \u2014 if you can't maintain nasal breathing, you're running too hard for Zone 2."}]}

This is where smart athletes gain 30-60 seconds over the course of a race without running or working any harder.\n\n**The Immediate Post-Station Protocol (first 15-30 seconds):**\n\nAs soon as you finish a station and start moving toward the run course, take **5-10 deep diaphragmatic breaths.** Here's the specific technique:\n\n1. **Inhale through your nose for a 4-count** \u2014 fill your belly first, then your chest (diaphragmatic breathing, not chest breathing)\n2. **Exhale through your mouth for a 4-count** \u2014 controlled, steady exhale, not a forceful blow\n3. **Repeat 5-10 times** as you walk or slow-jog to the run start\n\nThis 4-count inhale, 4-count exhale pattern activates your **parasympathetic nervous system** \u2014 the body's \"rest and digest\" mode. It's the fastest physiological mechanism you have for lowering heart rate. Research shows that extended exhales in particular stimulate the vagus nerve, which directly slows heart rate.\n\n**Why this works:** After a hard station, you're in sympathetic overdrive \u2014 fight or flight. Your heart rate is elevated, breathing is rapid and shallow, and stress hormones are flooding your system. The controlled breathing interrupts this cascade and begins shifting you back toward a recoverable state.\n\n**The Transition-to-Run Protocol:**\n\n- **Don't sprint into the run.** Start the first 100-200m at an easy jog \u2014 even slower than your target run pace. Let your breathing settle into a rhythmic pattern.\n- **Match breathing to foot strikes.** A 3:3 pattern (inhale for 3 steps, exhale for 3 steps) works well for easy pace. As you build speed, shift to 3:2 or 2:2.\n- **By 400m into the run,** you should be at your target pace with controlled, rhythmic breathing.\n\n**Practice this in training:** After every station practice, immediately do the 5-10 breath protocol followed by a 1km run. Train the transition as deliberately as you train the stations themselves. On race day, this sequence should be automatic \u2014 not something you're trying to remember while gasping.\n\n**Pro tip:** During the farmer carry specifically, use the entire 200m as active breathing recovery. It's the only station slow enough to genuinely recover your respiratory rate. Nail your breathing on the carry, and you'll arrive at sandbag lunges in much better shape."}]}

How do I stop this?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is more common than you'd think, and it's not a fitness problem \u2014 it's **anxiety-driven breathing dysfunction.** By rep 60, you're deep in accumulated fatigue from 7 stations and 7 runs. Your body is stressed, your brain perceives threat, and your breathing shifts from controlled rhythm to rapid, shallow panic breathing. That shallow breathing reduces CO2 clearance inefficiently and triggers the hyperventilation spiral.\n\n**The fix is a pre-set breathing protocol that removes decision-making under duress.**\n\n**Step 1: Set your breathing pattern BEFORE the first rep.**\nStand at the wall ball station, take 3 deep breaths, and tell yourself the pattern: \"Exhale on throw. Inhale on catch.\" Then pick up the ball. The pattern must be established when you're calm \u2014 not reconstructed when you're at rep 60 and panicking.\n\n**Step 2: Lock in the rhythm from rep 1.**\nExhale as you drive the ball up. Inhale as you catch it and squat down. One full breath cycle per rep. This should feel almost meditative in the first 20 reps \u2014 that's intentional. You're building a rhythm that will carry you through the hard reps.\n\n**Step 3: The 3-Breath Rule when you break.**\nWhen you need to rest (and you will), take **exactly 3 deep diaphragmatic breaths** before resuming. Not 2, not 5 \u2014 exactly 3. Here's why:\n- **3 breaths prevents rushing back in.** Two breaths isn't enough recovery \u2014 you'll resume with an elevated heart rate and lose the set faster.\n- **3 breaths prevents standing around too long.** More than 3 breaths and you start cooling down, your muscles stiffen, and anxiety about restarting builds. The longer you stand there, the harder it is to pick the ball back up.\n\n**Step 4: Break BEFORE you panic, not after.**\nPlan your break sets in advance. If you know you fade at rep 60, plan for sets of **25-25-25-25** or **30-25-25-20.** Breaking at planned intervals while your breathing is still controlled is infinitely better than grinding to failure and gasping.\n\n**The training prescription:**\nIn your next 5 wall ball sessions, practice this exact sequence:\n1. 3 deep breaths before starting\n2. Exhale on throw, inhale on catch \u2014 every rep\n3. Planned break at rep 25 \u2014 exactly 3 breaths \u2014 resume\n4. Repeat through all 100 reps\n\nStart at a lighter ball if needed. The goal is to make the breathing pattern automatic, not to hit race weight. Once the breathing is locked in at light weight, progress to race weight.\n\n**The mental reframe:** Rep 60 panic happens because your brain is projecting forward \u2014 \"I still have 40 reps, I can't do this.\" Stay in the current rep. Exhale, throw. Inhale, catch. That's your entire world. One rep at a time, one breath at a time."}]}
