You need to know these cold before race day.\n\n**Full Station Weight Table — Men's Open:**\n\n| Station | Task | Men's Open Spec |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1. SkiErg | 1000m | No external weight — bodyweight effort |\n| 2. Sled Push | 50m | **152kg total sled weight** |\n| 3. Sled Pull | 50m | **103kg total sled weight** |\n| 4. Burpee Broad Jump | 80m | Bodyweight |\n| 5. Rowing | 1000m | No external weight |\n| 6. Farmer's Carry | 200m | **2 x 24kg kettlebells (48kg total)** |\n| 7. Sandbag Lunges | 100m | **20kg sandbag** |\n| 8. Wall Balls | 100 reps | **6kg ball to 3m (10ft) target** |\n\n**Critical detail that athletes constantly get wrong:** The sled push and sled pull are NOT the same weight. The sled push is 152kg — significantly heavier than the sled pull at 103kg. That's a 49kg difference. The reason is biomechanical: the pulling motion recruits smaller muscle groups (biceps, rear delts, lats in a disadvantaged position) compared to pushing (quads, glutes, full posterior chain). A lighter pull sled keeps the station challenging without making it impossible.\n\n**Training implications:** You need to train these weights specifically. Don't just \"do sled work\" — load the exact race weights and practice at those loads. And remember, the Hyrox competition carpet creates substantially more friction than gym floors. Add 20-35kg to your gym sled weights to simulate race-day resistance. So for sled push practice, you want 172-187kg on a gym sled; for sled pull, aim for 123-138kg."}]}

The sled push and sled pull are NOT the same weight. Not even close. Let me give you the exact numbers across all divisions.\n\n**Sled Push vs. Sled Pull — Side by Side:**\n\n| Division | Sled Push (Station 2) | Sled Pull (Station 3) | Difference |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Men's Open | **152kg** | **103kg** | Push is 49kg heavier |\n| Women's Open | **102kg** | **78kg** | Push is 24kg heavier |\n| Men's Pro | **202kg** | **153kg** | Push is 49kg heavier |\n| Women's Pro | **152kg** | **103kg** | Push is 49kg heavier |\n| Men's Doubles | **152kg** | **103kg** | Push is 49kg heavier |\n| Women's Doubles | **102kg** | **78kg** | Push is 24kg heavier |\n| Mixed Doubles | **127kg** | **93kg** | Push is 34kg heavier |\n\n**Why are they different?** It comes down to biomechanics. When you push a sled, you engage the largest, most powerful muscles in your body — quads, glutes, hamstrings, calves — in a mechanically advantaged position. Your entire body weight leans into the sled.\n\nWhen you pull, you're using smaller muscles in a mechanically disadvantaged position — biceps, lats, rear delts, grip. Even with the hip extension technique, you simply cannot generate the same force pulling as pushing. If the pull sled were 152kg, most athletes would take 10+ minutes on it, and injury risk would spike.\n\n**Training takeaway:** Load your training sleds differently for push and pull days. If you've been using the same weight for both, you've been either under-training your push or over-training your pull."}]}

SkiErg | 1000m | Bodyweight — same distance as men |\n| 2. Sled Push | 50m | **102kg total sled weight** |\n| 3. Sled Pull | 50m | **78kg total sled weight** |\n| 4.

The total race distance is always approximately 16km (8km running + station distances). The station distances (50m sled, 80m BBJ, 200m carry, 100m lunges, 100 wall ball reps) are also identical across divisions.\n\n**Training note:** Don't think of the lighter weights as \"easier.\" Relative to body weight, the women's weights create a very similar challenge. A 65kg woman pushing 102kg is pushing 1.57x body weight — comparable to an 85kg man pushing 152kg at 1.79x body weight. Train at race weight and slightly above to build confidence and race-day readiness."}]}

Friction scales with load, so on that competition carpet, Men's Pro sled push feels dramatically heavier than Open. Most Pro athletes report that sleds are where the division gap hits hardest.\n\n**My advice:** Don't jump to Pro until your Open finish time is under 1:10:00 for men or 1:15:00 for women. Pro weights with insufficient strength will crush your times and, more importantly, increase injury risk on fatigued muscles. Build your Open performance first, then graduate."}]}

Here are the exact specs.\n\n**Wall Ball Specifications by Division:**\n\n| Division | Ball Weight | Target Height |\n|---|---|---|\n| Men's Open | **6kg (13.2 lbs)** | **3m (10ft)** |\n| Women's Open | **4kg (8.8 lbs)** | **2.7m (9ft)** |\n| Men's Pro | **9kg (19.8 lbs)** | **3m (10ft)** |\n| Women's Pro | **6kg (13.2 lbs)** | **3m (10ft)** |\n\n**The rep count is 100 wall balls** across all divisions. No variation there.\n\n**Why this matters for training:** 100 wall balls sounds manageable when you're fresh in the gym. But at Station 8, you've already completed 7km of running, a SkiErg, sled push, sled pull, 80m of burpee broad jumps, a 1000m row, 200m of farmer's carry, and 100m of sandbag lunges. Your quads are destroyed. Your shoulders are fatigued. Your heart rate is elevated.\n\n**The target height is non-negotiable.** The ball must visibly hit at or above the line. Judges will no-rep you for balls that don't reach the target. In a fatigued state, athletes tend to cut the squat depth AND the throw height — both earn no-reps that waste energy and time.\n\n**Training protocol for race-ready wall balls:**\n- Practice sets of 20-25 unbroken at race weight and target height\n- Build to 50 unbroken, then 75, then 100\n- Always train wall balls AFTER a conditioning piece — never fresh. Run 1km, do 20 lunges, then hit your wall balls. That's closer to race conditions.\n- If you can do 100 unbroken after a 1km run and lunges, you're race-ready for this station\n\n**Break strategy for race day:** Most athletes break wall balls into sets. Common patterns: 25-25-25-25, or 30-25-25-20, or 50-30-20. Pick one before race day and practice it."}]}

By Station 6, you've already done sled pull (grip), BBJs (full body), and rowing (grip again). Your forearms are partially depleted. Then you have to carry 48kg for 200 meters without setting it down — because every time you set it down, you lose 5-10 seconds picking it back up, plus your heart rate spikes from the re-grip effort.\n\n**Training the farmer's carry:**\n- **Minimum gym standard:** Carry race weight (2x24kg for Men's Open) for 200m unbroken. If you can't do this fresh, you need more grip work.\n- **Race-ready standard:** Carry race weight for 200m immediately after a 1km run and rowing intervals. If you can still go unbroken, you're solid.\n- **Grip endurance builders:** Dead hangs (work up to 90 seconds), heavy barbell holds (1.5x body weight for 30-45 seconds), and high-rep kettlebell swings (sets of 30+).\n\n**Pacing tip:** Walk briskly, don't run. Running with farmer's carry weights increases energy cost disproportionately and often leads to earlier grip failure. A fast, purposeful walk at about 70-75% of your normal walking speed is the sweet spot. The best athletes finish in 1:30-2:00 — that's a brisk walk, not a sprint."}]}

It sits across the back of your neck and upper traps, similar to a back squat position. Both hands should stabilize it.\n\n**Why 100m of lunges is brutal at this point:** Quick math — at roughly 0.7-0.8m per lunge step, you're looking at **125-145 individual lunge reps** to cover 100m. That's after 7km of running, every other station, and with your quads already hammered from sled push, BBJs, and the farmer's carry you just finished. This is where the race gets truly uncomfortable.\n\n**The rules you need to know:**\n- Back knee must touch or nearly touch the ground on every rep (judges will no-rep shallow lunges)\n- Walking lunges — you must move forward, no standing rest between reps (you can pause, but feet must stay in lunge position)\n- The sandbag stays on your shoulders. If it falls, pick it up and reset before continuing\n\n**Training recommendations:**\n- Start with bodyweight walking lunges: build to 100m unbroken\n- Add a 10kg sandbag, then 15kg, then race weight (20kg for Men's Open)\n- Practice lunges at the END of workouts when your legs are fatigued — that's race simulation\n- Count your steps to cover 100m in training. Know your number. Break the distance into mental chunks (e.g., 5 x 20m or 4 x 25m)\n- Average male finisher: ~6:30 on this station. Elite Pro men: ~3:26.

Breaking the sled out of static friction at every turn costs 3-5 seconds per turn. Elite athletes minimize turn time by quickly resetting their body angle and immediately driving.\n- Total turns: 3 turns in 4 lanes.\n- **Weight reminder: Men's Open = 152kg. Women's Open = 102kg.**\n\n**Sled Pull (Station 3) — 50m:**\n- Same 50m total distance, but the pulling setup is different. You stand in a fixed athlete box (approximately 1.8m) and pull the sled toward you using the attached rope.\n- The sled starts 12.5m away. You pull it to you, then the sled is reset at 12.5m for the next pull. Repeat until you've pulled 50m total.\n- You don't walk or move — the sled comes to you.\n- **Weight reminder: Men's Open = 103kg. Women's Open = 78kg.** NOT the same as push weight.\n\n**The critical difference in how they tire you:**\n- Sled push destroys your **quads, glutes, and calves** — pure lower body power with some shoulder stabilization.\n- Sled pull hammers your **grip, biceps, lats, and lower back** — upper body and posterior chain dominant.\n- Because they're back-to-back (Stations 2 and 3), you get a combined 100m of sled work that hits virtually every major muscle group. The run between them (Run 3) is where you feel how much the push took out of your quads.\n\n**Pro tip:** Practice the turns on sled push specifically. Set up 12.5m markers and do full race-format pushes with proper turns. The difference between a 3-second turn and an 8-second turn across 3 turns is 15 seconds — free time."}]}

A stronger athlete can push/pull/carry at a lower percentage of their max, meaning less fatigue and faster times. SkiErg, rowing, and BBJ disproportionately reward aerobic capacity and movement efficiency — which favors the better runner.\n\n**One caveat:** Talk to your partner about what she WANTS to do. If she did sled push in her previous Hyrox and felt confident, her experience on that station might outweigh your raw strength advantage. Race-day confidence matters.\n\n**Final tip:** Practice transitions. In Doubles, the handoff between partners needs to be smooth — know exactly where the transition zone is and have a plan for the tag."}]}

The push is 49kg heavier. This is a common misconception — I've seen athletes train both at 152kg and wonder why their pull times are so slow in training. Or worse, train both at 103kg and get destroyed on the push at the race.\n\n**Training schedule for weight familiarization (8 weeks out):**\n\n- **Weeks 8-6:** Train at 70-80% of race weight. Focus on perfect technique at every station.\n- **Weeks 6-4:** Train at 100% race weight. Hit the exact numbers in the table above.\n- **Weeks 4-2:** Train at 100-110% race weight (or gym-adjusted weights for sleds). Build confidence by over-preparing.\n- **Race week:** Light technique work at 60-70% race weight. You're not building fitness this week — you're sharpening movement patterns.\n\n**The stations you can't weight-train for:** SkiErg (1000m), rowing (1000m), and burpee broad jumps (80m) are all bodyweight efforts. But they need just as much practice — specifically under fatigue. Do them after other exercises, not fresh."}]}

Are they as heavy as they sound?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let me give you an honest assessment. Some stations will feel heavy, some won't — and the context of WHEN you hit them matters more than the absolute weight.\n\n**Here's how each weighted station actually feels for a first-timer (Men's Open):**\n\n**Sled Push (152kg) — FEELS HEAVY.**\nThis is the station that shocks most first-timers. 152kg is a lot of weight on competition carpet. If you've never pushed a sled at race weight on high-friction surface, do it before race day. Add 20-35kg to your gym sled to simulate the carpet. The good news: it's Station 2, so you're relatively fresh. The bad news: it torches your quads for the rest of the race.\n\n**Sled Pull (103kg) — MODERATE but TECHNIQUE-DEPENDENT.**\n103kg sounds manageable, but it's a pulling motion from a stationary position. If your technique is bad (arms-only pulling), it feels impossibly heavy. If your technique is good (hip extension method), it's challenging but doable. Critical: this is NOT the same weight as the sled push — it's 49kg lighter.\n\n**Farmer's Carry (2x24kg / 48kg total) — GRIP IS THE LIMITER.**\nThe weight isn't that heavy to pick up. It's heavy to hold for 200 meters after you've already done sled pull, BBJs, and rowing. Your forearms are compromised by Station 6. Practice grip endurance, not just grip strength.\n\n**Sandbag Lunges (20kg) — THE SANDBAG ISN'T THE PROBLEM. YOUR QUADS ARE.**\n20kg on your shoulders is nothing when you're fresh. After 7km of running and 6 stations, your quads are in deep fatigue. The 20kg sandbag just makes each lunge that much harder to stand up from. This station is about muscular endurance, not strength.\n\n**Wall Balls (6kg ball) — DEATH BY A THOUSAND REPS.**\n6kg sounds light. Do 100 reps after everything else and tell me it's light. The challenge isn't the weight — it's the repetition under extreme fatigue. Shoulders burn, quads burn, hip flexors burn.\n\n**Bottom line:** Don't be nervous about the absolute weights. Be nervous about your ability to move those weights after 60+ minutes of racing. Train the stations in a fatigued state and race day will feel familiar."}]}

The sled push is 102kg — that's almost twice my body weight! How do I even train for that?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I hear this concern a lot, and I want to reframe it for you. Yes, 102kg is 1.7x your body weight. But the sled push isn't a lift — it's a horizontal push where gravity and body mechanics work WITH you, not against you. Here's how to build up to it.\n\n**The Physics Working in Your Favor:**\nYou're not lifting 102kg — you're pushing it horizontally. Friction is your enemy, not gravity. Your body weight leans into the sled at 45 degrees, meaning your 60kg of body weight creates significant horizontal force. Technique (body angle, leg drive, step cadence) matters more than absolute strength here.\n\n**8-Week Sled Push Progression for Women's Open (102kg):**\n\n| Week | Sled Weight | Sets x Distance | Focus |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1-2 | **50-60kg** (~50%) | 4 x 25m, 2 min rest | Body angle, short steps, leg drive |\n| 3-4 | **70-80kg** (~70%) | 4 x 25m, 90 sec rest | Maintaining technique under load |\n| 5-6 | **90-102kg** (90-100%) | 3-4 x 25m, 2 min rest | Race weight confidence |\n| 7-8 | **102-125kg** (100-120%) | 3 x 12.5m race format, add 500m run before | Over-preparation + fatigue simulation |\n\n**Strength Exercises That Transfer Directly:**\n- **Leg press:** Work up to 2x body weight for reps of 10. This builds the quad and glute power you need.\n- **Wall sits:** 60-90 seconds. Builds the isometric endurance of maintaining that pushing position.\n- **Heavy goblet squats:** 3x12 at 20-24kg. Trains the same squat pattern you use for leg drive.\n- **Sled push at gym weight + carpet simulation:** Add 20-35kg to your gym sled to account for competition carpet friction.\n\n**For the sled pull (78kg):**\nThe pull is lighter than the push — 78kg vs 102kg. That's intentional because the pulling motion uses smaller muscles. Use the hip extension technique (not arms-only) and chalk your hands.\n\n**Confidence builder:** The average Women's Open sled push time is around 4:30. That means MOST women your size finish this station just fine. You're not expected to sprint it — just maintain steady forward progress. Consistent leg drive with short steps beats trying to power through it."}]}

How much harder are the Pro weights?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A 1:08:30 Men's Open is a strong time — you're in the top tier of Open athletes. Let me give you the honest breakdown of what Pro weights actually mean so you can make an informed decision.\n\n**Weight Increases from Men's Open to Men's Pro:**\n\n| Station | Open | Pro | Increase | % Increase |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Sled Push | 152kg | **202kg** | +50kg | +33% |\n| Sled Pull | 103kg | **153kg** | +50kg | +49% |\n| Farmer's Carry | 2x24kg | **2x32kg** | +16kg total | +33% |\n| Sandbag Lunges | 20kg | **30kg** | +10kg | +50% |\n| Wall Balls | 6kg/3m | **9kg/3m** | +3kg ball | +50% |\n\n**The Raw Impact on Your Time:**\nBased on data from athletes who've made the Open-to-Pro transition, expect your station times to increase by **25-50%** on weighted stations. That's not linear either — the sled push at 202kg on competition carpet is a completely different experience than 152kg. It's not \"a bit harder.\" It's a different movement.\n\n**Rough time impact estimate for someone at your level:**\n- Sled push: +45 to +90 seconds\n- Sled pull: +40 to +80 seconds\n- Farmer's carry: +20 to +40 seconds\n- Sandbag lunges: +30 to +60 seconds\n- Wall balls: +30 to +60 seconds\n- **Total estimated increase: 2:45 to 5:30**\n\nSo your 1:08:30 Open might translate to roughly **1:11:00-1:14:00 Pro** — assuming your running stays the same. That would make you competitive but not elite in Pro.\n\n**My recommendation:** Before committing, do a \"Pro simulation\" workout. Load your gym sleds to Pro weight (with carpet adjustment), use 32kg kettlebells for carries, 30kg sandbag for lunges, and a 9kg wall ball. Do a full race simulation. If you can finish all stations cleanly — not fast, just cleanly — you're ready. If you're grinding to a halt on the 202kg sled push, spend another season building strength in Open.\n\n**The cutoff I use:** If your Open time is under 1:05:00 and you can bench 1.25x body weight, squat 1.5x body weight, and deadlift 2x body weight, you have the strength base for Pro. Below that, Pro weights become a survival exercise rather than a race."}]}

My wife and I are signing up."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great choice — Mixed Doubles is one of the most popular and fun Hyrox formats. Here's every weight and spec you both need to know.\n\n**Mixed Doubles Complete Weight Table:**\n\n| Station | Weight/Spec | Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1. SkiErg | 1000m | Same as all divisions |\n| 2. Sled Push | **127kg** | Midpoint between Men's Open (152kg) and Women's Open (102kg) |\n| 3. Sled Pull | **93kg** | Midpoint between Men's Open (103kg) and Women's Open (78kg) |\n| 4. BBJ | 80m | Same as all divisions |\n| 5. Rowing | 1000m | Same as all divisions |\n| 6. Farmer's Carry | **2 x 20kg (40kg total)** | Midpoint between men's (2x24kg) and women's (2x16kg) |\n| 7. Sandbag Lunges | **15kg** | Midpoint between men's (20kg) and women's (10kg) |\n| 8. Wall Balls | **6kg ball / 2.7m target** | Men's ball weight with women's target height |\n\n**Key point:** Both partners use the SAME weights regardless of gender. There's no \"his weight\" and \"her weight\" — it's one standardized Mixed Doubles weight for both.\n\n**Format reminder:**\n- You alternate stations: Partner A does stations 1, 3, 5, 7 and Partner B does stations 2, 4, 6, 8\n- You both run every running segment (4 x 1km each, 8km total per person)\n- You choose who does which stations before the race\n\n**Strategic weight implications for your team:**\nThe Mixed Doubles weights are a compromise. For you (assuming male), 127kg sled push is LIGHTER than your Men's Open weight of 152kg — so the sleds should feel manageable. For your wife, 127kg sled push is HEAVIER than Women's Open at 102kg — so she may want to avoid that station.\n\nThis is why station allocation matters. Assign the heavier stations (sled push, sled pull, farmer's carry) to the stronger partner, and the cardio/bodyweight stations (SkiErg, BBJ, rowing) to the partner with better endurance. Then give sandbag lunges to whoever has better quad endurance — it's 100m of walking lunges with 15kg either way.\n\n**Training plan:** Both of you should practice at 127kg sled push and 93kg sled pull, even if one partner won't do that station on race day. You never know if plans change, and cross-training at those weights builds general preparedness."}]}

I've seen different numbers online and I'm confused."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You're right to be cautious — there IS some confusion online because of how Hyrox has evolved. Let me clarify what's current and what's changed.\n\n**Current Weights (2024-2025 Season) — These are what you train for:**\n\n| Station | Men's Open | Women's Open | Men's Pro | Women's Pro |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Sled Push | 152kg | 102kg | 202kg | 152kg |\n| Sled Pull | 103kg | 78kg | 153kg | 103kg |\n| Farmer's Carry | 2x24kg | 2x16kg | 2x32kg | 2x24kg |\n| Sandbag Lunges | 20kg | 10kg | 30kg | 20kg |\n| Wall Balls | 6kg/3m | 4kg/2.7m | 9kg/3m | 6kg/3m |\n\n**What has remained consistent:** The station order, distances (SkiErg 1000m, sleds 50m, BBJ 80m, rowing 1000m, carry 200m, lunges 100m, wall balls 100 reps), and the 8 x 1km run format have been stable across recent seasons.\n\n**What causes confusion online:**\n1. **Sled weights include the sled itself.** The 152kg for Men's Open sled push is TOTAL weight — sled plus added plates. Some sources list just the added plates, which leads to different numbers floating around.\n2. **Old season weights.** Hyrox has made minor adjustments over the years. If you're reading a blog from 2022, the weights might be slightly different from current season.\n3. **Sled push vs. sled pull confusion.** Some sources incorrectly list them as the same weight. They are NOT. Sled push is significantly heavier than sled pull in every division. Men's Open: push 152kg vs. pull 103kg — that's a 49kg difference.\n4. **Regional variations.** Occasionally, specific venues may have slightly different sled weights due to equipment availability, though Hyrox works hard to standardize.\n\n**My advice:** Always check the official Hyrox website for the current season's exact specifications before you race. Train at the weights listed above, and add 20-35kg to your gym sled weights to account for competition carpet friction. When in doubt, train heavier — being over-prepared on race day is always better than being under-prepared.\n\n**The most important thing:** Don't get confused by different numbers online and end up training at the wrong weight. Pick the current season's official weights, load them in the gym, and practice at those exact loads."}]}
