Using PEDs puts your race eligibility at risk, and frankly, it undermines the sport for everyone competing clean.\n\nBut here's the thing most people don't realize: the performance ceiling for natural athletes in Hyrox is incredibly high and almost nobody is close to it. The limiting factors for most athletes aren't pharmacological \u2014 they're:\n\n- **Technical:** Poor sled push mechanics, inefficient SkiErg technique, bad BBJ pacing\n- **Strategic:** Going out too fast, not training station transitions, poor race-day nutrition\n- **Programming:** Not enough Zone 2 base, insufficient station-specific practice, poor periodization\n\nI can help you maximize your natural performance through evidence-based training, nutrition timing, recovery protocols, and race strategy.

There are anecdotes and case studies, but no controlled trials in this population. So anyone giving you definitive answers is speculating.\n\nWhat I DO know from solid evidence:\n\n**Carbohydrates are the primary fuel for glycolytic work in Hyrox.** The sled push, sled pull, wall balls, and BBJs all operate heavily in the glycolytic energy system \u2014 and glycolysis runs on glucose. Restricting carbs could directly impair performance at these stations. The 1km runs between stations also dip into glycolytic territory, especially in the later rounds.\n\n**High-intensity work suffers on very low-carb diets.** This is well-established in the literature. Keto-adapted athletes can perform well at steady-state aerobic efforts, but repeated high-intensity efforts \u2014 which is literally what Hyrox is \u2014 show consistent performance decrements.\n\n**That said,** I'm not a dietitian and I don't have visibility into your full health picture, metabolic markers, or reasons for considering this approach.\n\n**My recommendation:** Speak with a sports dietitian before making major dietary changes, especially this close to a race. They can evaluate your specific situation and, if you do want to try a lower-carb approach, help you find a version that doesn't tank your station performance. I'd prioritize fueling your training over dietary ideology."}]}

I can't diagnose joint issues \u2014 and you shouldn't trust anyone who tries to diagnose them without physically examining you.\n\nThat said, here's what I can offer as general context:\n\n**Painless clicking (crepitus)** is extremely common and usually benign. It's often caused by:\n- Gas bubbles in the synovial fluid (same mechanism as cracking knuckles)\n- Tendons or ligaments sliding over bony prominences\n- Normal cartilage movement\n\nIf the clicking is painless, happens consistently in the same spot, and doesn't affect your range of motion or strength \u2014 it's almost certainly nothing to worry about. Many athletes have clicking knees their entire careers with zero issues.\n\n**However, see a physio or orthopedist if:**\n- There's pain accompanying the click\n- You notice swelling after activity\n- The knee catches, locks, or gives way\n- The clicking started after a specific incident (fall, twist, impact)\n- It's getting progressively worse\n\n**What I can do:** If a physio evaluates you and says it's benign, we train normally. If they identify something that needs management, I'll modify your program \u2014 maybe adjusting squat depth for wall balls, substituting certain exercises, or changing your running surface. But I need their assessment first before I change anything.\n\nDon't let Dr. Google diagnose your knee. Get hands-on evaluation from someone qualified."}]}

That's roughly 8 cups of coffee and well into the range where adverse effects \u2014 heart palpitations, GI distress, anxiety, and tremors \u2014 become likely. For some individuals, 800mg is genuinely dangerous.\n\nHere's what the research actually supports:\n\n**Evidence-based dosing: 3-6mg per kg of body weight.** For an 80kg athlete, that's 240-480mg. For a 65kg athlete, it's 195-390mg. Most athletes land in the **200-400mg range**, which provides meaningful performance benefits without the crash.\n\n**Timing matters:** Take it **45-60 minutes before your race start** to align peak blood concentration with your warm-up and early stations.\n\n**But here's my honest caveat:** Individual tolerance varies enormously based on genetics (CYP1A2 enzyme activity), habitual intake, body composition, and sensitivity. Some athletes perform great on 200mg; others get jittery. This is an area where I'd suggest working with a sports nutritionist to dial in your specific protocol.\n\n**Non-negotiable rules:**\n1. **Never try a new caffeine dose on race day.** Test it during a hard training session first \u2014 ideally a race simulation.\n2. **Account for other sources.** Pre-workout, energy gels, and some electrolyte mixes contain caffeine.

Symptoms include unexplained fatigue, declining performance, and elevated heart rate at normal paces. Many athletes have \"normal\" hemoglobin but low ferritin \u2014 and performance suffers.\n- **Vitamin D:** Affects muscle function, bone health, and recovery. Athletes who train indoors or live in northern latitudes are frequently deficient.\n- **Thyroid function (TSH, T3, T4):** Overtraining and under-fueling can suppress thyroid function, which tanks energy and recovery.\n- **CRP (C-reactive protein):** A general inflammation marker that can flag overtraining or incomplete recovery.\n- **Testosterone/cortisol ratio:** Relevant for monitoring training stress and recovery capacity (for both men and women).\n\n**But interpreting blood work is outside my scope.** What looks \"normal\" on a standard reference range isn't always optimal for an athlete. A sports medicine doctor or endocrinologist can interpret results in the context of your training load.\n\n**My suggestion:** Get a baseline panel now \u2014 16 weeks out from your race \u2014 and a follow-up at 8 weeks. If your doctor identifies any deficiencies, tell me and I can adjust your training load, recovery protocols, and session intensity accordingly.
