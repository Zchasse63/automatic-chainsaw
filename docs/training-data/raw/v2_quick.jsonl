If 3-4 of those days are easy/Zone 2 and only 1-2 are hard (intervals, tempo, race-pace), that's a solid approach and actually mirrors what most competitive Hyrox athletes do. If all 5 are hard, yes, that's too much \u2014 you'll accumulate fatigue without adequate recovery, and your station training will suffer.\n\nThe 80/20 rule applies: roughly 80% of your running volume should be easy enough to hold a conversation. The other 20% is where the speed and lactate threshold adaptations happen.\n\nWant me to break down an ideal weekly running structure for your current fitness level?"}]}

Running is free and makes up half the race. Many station movements can be substituted \u2014 lunges with a heavy backpack, broad jump burpees in a park, wall balls with a slam ball against any wall.\n\nThe hard part: you'll need access to a SkiErg and sleds somewhere.

The rower can be simulated with resistance band rows for conditioning, though nothing perfectly replicates it.\n\nWant me to lay out a full no-gym Hyrox training plan with substitutions for each station?"}]}

A marathon is 3-5 hours of sustained aerobic effort at a relatively steady intensity. Hyrox is 60-90 minutes of mixed effort \u2014 your heart rate oscillates between zones as you alternate running and high-intensity stations.\n\nMany marathon runners struggle with Hyrox stations because they lack upper body strength and anaerobic capacity. And many strong Hyrox athletes couldn't finish a marathon because they haven't built the aerobic base for 42km.\n\nThe better question is which one matches your strengths. With your running base of 35-40 miles/week, you've got the aerobic engine \u2014 the Hyrox-specific adaptation is building station proficiency on top of it.\n\nWant me to compare the training demands side by side?"}]}

CrossFit builds the movement vocabulary (wall balls, rowing, burpees) and the mental toughness for sustained discomfort. Those are real advantages.\n\nWhat it lacks for Hyrox:\n- **Running volume.** Most CrossFit programming has minimal running. You need an aerobic base for 8km of running between stations.\n- **Race-specific pacing.** CrossFit rewards short, intense efforts. Hyrox rewards 70-90 minute sustained output with strategic pacing.\n- **Sled work on carpet.** Hyrox sleds on competition carpet feel nothing like gym-floor sled pushes.\n\nIf you're coming from CrossFit, you'll need to add running volume and practice Hyrox-specific pacing.

No shame in walking. Better to walk briefly and recover than to bonk completely and lose 5 minutes standing still with your hands on your knees.\n\nMany experienced athletes walk portions of later runs \u2014 especially Run 7 (after sandbag lunges, which destroy your legs) and Run 8. It's a legitimate pacing strategy, not a failure.\n\nThe goal is to keep moving forward. A 6:30/km walk beats a 30-second standstill every time. If you need to walk, walk with purpose: upright posture, arms swinging, controlled breathing. Recover actively, then resume running when your heart rate drops.\n\nThe finish line doesn't care whether you ran or walked to get there."}]}
