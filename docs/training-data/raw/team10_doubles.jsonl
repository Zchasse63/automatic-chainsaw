My buddy and I are thinking about signing up."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great choice — Doubles is one of the best ways to experience Hyrox, especially if one of you is newer to the format. But I need to make sure you understand exactly how it works, because this is the single most misunderstood format in the sport.\n\n**The Running Rule — This Is Non-Negotiable:**\nBOTH of you must run ALL 8 x 1km runs TOGETHER. Every single one. You cannot split the runs. You cannot alternate. You cannot have one person run some legs while the other rests. Both partners run the full 8km. Period.\n\nThe official rulebook states you must stay within **5 seconds** of each other at all times during runs. Best practice: stay within arm's reach. If you separate, each infringement is a **1-minute time penalty**. Three penalties is the max — a 4th means you're disqualified (Out of Competition, no official result).\n\n**The Station Rule — YGIG (You Go / I Go):**\nBoth partners go to ALL 8 stations together. At each station, you split the work however you want using the YGIG principle — while one partner works, the other rests. Then you switch. The split is entirely up to you. You can go 50/50 at every station, 70/30 at some, or even have one partner do 100% of a particular station if that's your strategy.\n\nHere's the key: only ONE partner can be working at a time. The resting partner must stand in the designated area. You can shout encouragement but you cannot physically assist — no touching equipment, no passing handles, nothing.\n\n**The Full Race Sequence:**\nRun 1 → SkiErg (1,000m, split YGIG) → Run 2 → Sled Push (50m, split YGIG) → Run 3 → Sled Pull (50m, split YGIG) → Run 4 → Burpee Broad Jumps (80m, split YGIG) → Run 5 → Rowing (1,000m, split YGIG) → Run 6 → Farmer's Carry (200m, split YGIG) → Run 7 → Sandbag Lunges (100m, split YGIG) → Run 8 → Wall Balls (100 reps, split YGIG) → Finish\n\n**Weights:**\nDoubles Open uses the exact same weights as Singles Open. Doubles Pro uses the same as Singles Pro. The weights don't change between formats — only the station work is shared between partners.\n\nBottom line: you're running the full 8km. You're splitting station work with a built-in rest during your partner's turns. It's not half a Hyrox — it's a different tactical challenge."}]}

Like she runs the odd legs and I run the even ones?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Absolutely NOT. This is the single most misunderstood rule in Hyrox Doubles, and I need to be crystal clear about it.\n\n**Both partners MUST run ALL 8 x 1km runs TOGETHER. Every single one.**\n\nYou cannot take turns. You cannot alternate. You cannot split them in any ratio — not 50/50, not 60/40, not any other combination. Both of you run all 8 runs, side by side, every time.\n\nThe official rulebook (Season 25/26, Section 8.2) states explicitly: \"Both Doubles Team Members must run together for the entire 1,000m between each workout station.\" The timing system uses chips on both partners' ankles that continuously monitor your proximity. You must stay within **5 seconds** of each other at all times.\n\n**The penalty structure is harsh:**\n- Each time you separate: **1-minute time penalty**\n- Maximum of 3 penalties allowed\n- 4th infringement: **Out of Competition** — no ranking, no official result\n\nI've seen teams get confused about this because Relay format (4-person teams) DOES allow you to take turns. But Doubles is fundamentally different. In Doubles, the runs are shared — both of you do all of them. Only the station WORK is divided using the You Go / I Go (YGIG) system.\n\nThink of it this way: you run together, you work apart (one at a time on stations), you run together again. That's the rhythm of Doubles.\n\nThis rule actually creates an interesting tactical dynamic. If one partner is significantly faster, they must slow down to match the other. The faster partner effectively gets \"active recovery\" on the runs — running well below their threshold — which means they can push harder during their station work. The slower partner works harder on runs but can take a smaller share at stations to compensate. That's strategy, and it's what makes Doubles interesting."}]}

Can she run some of my legs to save time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No. Not a chance. I know it seems logical, but Hyrox rules are absolute on this: **both partners MUST run ALL 8 x 1km runs TOGETHER.** She can't run your legs. She can't run ahead and wait. You both run every kilometer, side by side, within 5 seconds of each other.\n\nIf she runs ahead? 1-minute penalty per infringement. Four of those and you're disqualified.\n\nBut here's the thing — this rule actually **benefits** the faster partner, and here's why:\n\n**For your faster partner, the runs become active recovery.** If she normally runs 1km at 4:30 and your pace is 5:15, she's running at roughly 70-75% of her capacity during every run segment. Her heart rate stays low. Her legs stay fresher. That means she can absolutely CRUSH her share of station work. She can take 60-70% of the sled push, dominate the farmer's carry, and go hard on wall balls while her heart rate stays manageable.\n\n**For you as the slower runner, you need to be strategic.** You're working harder on the runs — probably 85-90% effort at your pace. That means you should negotiate a lighter station split. Maybe you do 40% of the sled work, take the SkiErg at a moderate pace, and let her shoulder more of the heavy loaded stations.\n\n**Here's the training implication:** You MUST practice running together before race day. At least 3-4 sessions of running side by side at YOUR pace. It feels awkward for the faster partner at first, but it becomes second nature. She needs to learn to match your rhythm without constantly speeding up and slowing down — that's more tiring for both of you than just locking into a steady tempo from the start.\n\nThis pace mismatch is actually one of the most important factors in partner selection. Compatible running speed makes Doubles significantly smoother."}]}

Do we each take 4 stations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is another common misconception I need to correct. You do NOT each \"take\" 4 separate stations. Both partners go to ALL 8 stations together.\n\n**How It Actually Works — The YGIG (You Go / I Go) System:**\n\nAt every station, both of you are there. One partner works while the other rests in the designated area. You switch back and forth until the total work is done. The split at each station is entirely YOUR choice — there's no required ratio.\n\n**Example — 1,000m Row:**\nPartner A starts rowing. After 250m, you switch. Partner B rows 250m. Switch again. Partner A rows another 250m. Switch. Partner B finishes the last 250m. Total: 1,000m, split however you want.\n\n**Example — Sled Push (50m total, 4 x 12.5m lengths):**\nPartner A pushes the first 12.5m. Switches. Partner B pushes the next 12.5m. You can alternate each length, or one partner can push 3 lengths and the other does 1. Your call.\n\n**Example — 100 Wall Balls:**\nPartner A does 25 reps. Switches. Partner B does 25. Switch again. Continue until 100 total reps are done. The ball hits the floor between transitions — you cannot do a \"flying transition\" where one throws and the other catches.\n\n**Key Rules at Stations:**\n- Only ONE partner working at a time — never both simultaneously\n- Resting partner stays in the marked area (cannot help, touch equipment, or interfere)\n- Both partners must enter the station together and exit together\n- Verbal coaching and encouragement IS allowed\n- You CAN adjust your split mid-race — nothing has to be decided in advance\n\n**Strategic Approaches:**\n1. **50/50 Even Split** — simplest, good for first-timers or evenly matched teams\n2. **Strength-Based Split** — each partner does more of what they're better at (e.g., 70/30)\n3. **High-Frequency Tag-Team** — switch every 5-10 reps for maximum intensity\n4. **Specialist** — one partner does 100% of certain stations (risky, for elite teams only)\n\nMost competitive Doubles teams use frequent switching because short work intervals mean less lactate buildup and higher sustained power output."}]}

Let me set the record straight.\n\n**What's the SAME as Singles:**\n- You run the FULL 8km — all 8 x 1km runs, no reduction\n- The total station work is identical — same 1,000m SkiErg, same 50m sled push, same 100 wall balls. Every station has the same total volume as Singles\n- The weights are identical — Doubles Open = Singles Open weights, Doubles Pro = Singles Pro weights\n\n**What's DIFFERENT from Singles:**\n- Station work is SPLIT between you and your partner using the YGIG system — while one works, the other rests\n- You get built-in recovery during your partner's work intervals at each station\n- Running pace is typically slower because both partners must stay together (within 5 seconds)\n- The faster partner runs below threshold, effectively getting \"active recovery\" on runs\n\n**Is it easier? It's DIFFERENT. Here's the honest breakdown:**\n\nThe running is actually harder for the slower partner (they're working at a higher relative intensity to keep up) and easier for the faster partner (who's running below threshold). At stations, you're doing roughly half the work but at potentially HIGHER intensity because you get those micro-recoveries during your partner's turns.\n\n**Doubles finish times are typically faster than individual times** — and that's not because it's \"easier.\" It's because:\n1. Built-in rest at stations allows higher power output per interval\n2. The cumulative fatigue is lower (half the station volume on your body)\n3. The running pace may be slower but transitions are faster (one partner rests while the other works)\n\nHere's the reality check: you're still running 8km in a hot convention center with your heart rate bouncing between zones 3 and 5. The sled still weighs the same. You're still doing burpee broad jumps. It's a demanding race that requires specific training. If your friend thinks it's easy, tell him to sign up for Singles and see how he feels about those 100 wall balls at kilometer 7.5 of running."}]}

These are significantly heavier than Women's Open weights.\n\nThe one partial exception is Wall Balls: both use the 6 kg ball, but men throw to the 3.00m target and women throw to the 2.70m target.\n\n**What this means strategically:**\n- In same-sex Doubles: station splits can be more balanced since both partners face the same relative load\n- In Mixed Doubles: the male partner often takes a larger share of weighted stations (sled push, sled pull, farmer's carry) because the female partner is handling heavier-than-normal loads. The female partner can take more of the machine work (SkiErg, rowing) and bodyweight work (burpee broad jumps) where the weight difference doesn't apply\n\nAlso note: there is NO Mixed Pro Doubles division.

Nothing.\n\nHere's where you go and what you can do at each station:\n\n**Station-by-Station Resting Partner Rules:**\n\n1. **SkiErg** — Stand in the marked rest area. You are NOT allowed to pass the SkiErg handles from one partner to another.\n\n2. **Sled Push** — Walk immediately behind the working partner. Must NOT walk in a neighboring lane. When it's your turn, you step in and push from where they stopped.\n\n3. **Sled Pull** — Stand behind the working partner at all times. You MAY NOT assist with rope management in any way — not with your hands, not with your feet. However, you CAN offer verbal and physical guidance as long as you don't step on or in the racer's box.\n\n4. **Burpee Broad Jumps** — Walk behind the working partner. When transitioning, the resting partner places their hands where the working partner's feet landed (toes and fingers in line). Then you continue from that exact spot.\n\n5. **Rowing** — Stand in the marked area behind the rower. You are NOT permitted to pass the rower handle, adjust the damper setting, or adjust foot straps for your partner.\n\n6. **Farmer's Carry** — Walk behind the working partner. When switching, kettlebells must NOT be passed forward — only sideways or backwards.\n\n7. **Sandbag Lunges** — Walk behind the working partner. Sandbag must NOT be passed forward — only sideways or backwards during transitions.\n\n8. **Wall Balls** — Stand in the marked area underneath the rig. Ball transitions happen by letting the ball hit the floor or handing it between partners. A \"flying transition\" — where one throws and the other catches mid-squat — is NOT permitted and results in a no-rep.\n\n**What you CAN do:**\n- Shout encouragement — \"Let's go! Three more reps! Drive through the legs!\"\n- Coach their technique — \"Hips lower on the wall balls! Longer pulls on the row!\"\n- Count reps out loud for them\n- Use the rest time strategically: control your breathing, bring your heart rate down, hydrate if available\n\nThat rest period is gold. Use it. A competitive Doubles team treats the partner's work interval as active recovery — controlled breathing, mental preparation for the next station, staying warm without wasting energy."}]}

Her legs stay relatively fresh. Her perceived effort is low. Meanwhile, you're working at 85-90% effort on the runs.\n\n**Here's how you turn this into a winning strategy:**\n\n**Running Plan:**\n- Lock into YOUR sustainable pace — probably 5:20-5:30/km — from Run 1.

Here's what I'd suggest:\n\n| Station | Her Share | Your Share | Rationale |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| SkiErg (1,000m) | 600m | 400m | She has more gas in the tank from easy runs |\n| Sled Push (50m) | 3 lengths (37.5m) | 1 length (12.5m) | Depends on strength, but she's fresher |\n| Sled Pull (50m) | 3 lengths (37.5m) | 1 length (12.5m) | Same logic |\n| Burpee Broad Jumps (80m) | 50m | 30m | Bodyweight — advantage to lighter, fresher athlete |\n| Rowing (1,000m) | 600m | 400m | She's running easier, can row harder |\n| Farmer's Carry (200m) | 120m | 80m | Grip/strength dependent |\n| Sandbag Lunges (100m) | 60m | 40m | She has fresher legs from easier runs |\n| Wall Balls (100 reps) | 60 reps | 40 reps | Sustained effort — she's less fatigued |\n\nThis 60/40 split compensates for the fact that you're working harder on every run.

You're both physically present at every station. The official rulebook is clear: both partners must enter the station together and exit together. The workout can't begin until both of you are present.\n\n**What this means practically:**\n- At every station, you decide on the fly (or in advance) how to split the reps or distance\n- Only one of you works at a time — the other stands in the designated rest area\n- You can switch as many times as you want within a station\n- The split doesn't need to be the same at every station — you can go 70/30 at sled push and 40/60 at rowing\n\n**What this means strategically:**\nThis is actually BETTER than the \"own 4 stations\" system you were imagining. Here's why:\n\n1. **Built-in micro-recovery** — every station has rest intervals built in while your partner works\n2. **Flexibility** — if one of you is struggling mid-race, you adjust the split on the fly\n3. **Higher intensity** — short work intervals with rest means you can push harder per interval\n4. **No wasted time** — in your \"own 4 stations\" concept, one partner would theoretically sit out entirely at 4 stations. In reality, you're both always moving through the course together.\n\nSo to summarize the entire Doubles format one more time:\n- **Runs:** BOTH run ALL 8 x 1km — together, side by side, no exceptions\n- **Stations:** BOTH go to ALL 8 stations — split the work at each one (YGIG), any ratio you choose\n- **Strategy:** Use your partner's work time as recovery, adjust splits based on who's fresher\n\nYou've got 10 weeks.

Who's slower? Because BOTH of you run ALL 8 x 1km together. If you're the slower runner (common for heavier strength athletes), your partner is getting active recovery on every run — which means they'll have more gas for stations. Factor that into your split.\n\n**Practice this split at least 3 times in simulation before race day.** The transitions — knowing when to switch, how to switch cleanly — are where teams lose time."}]}

She's 5'4 120lbs and I'm 6'0 185lbs. How should we split the stations and handle the runs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mixed Doubles has a unique wrinkle that changes everything about your strategy: **both of you use Men's Open weights.** That means your girlfriend is pushing a 152 kg sled, carrying 2 x 24 kg farmer's carry handles, and lunging a 20 kg sandbag — significantly heavier than Women's Open weights (102 kg sled, 2 x 16 kg farmer's, 10 kg sandbag).\n\nThis size and weight difference means you need an asymmetric strategy. Here's what I'd prescribe:\n\n**Running Strategy — CRITICAL:**\nBoth of you MUST run ALL 8 x 1km runs together. Match HER pace. At 5'4 and 120 lbs, she's likely in the 5:15-5:45/km range for sustainable Hyrox running. You lock into that pace and treat every run as active recovery. Your heart rate stays in zone 2 while she's working in zone 3-4. This means you bring MORE to the stations.\n\n**Optimal Station YGIG Split:**\n\n| Station | You (6'0, 185 lbs) | Her (5'4, 120 lbs) | Rationale |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **SkiErg** (1,000m) | 450m (45%) | 550m (55%) | She's lighter, likely has good power-to-weight. SkiErg is technique-dependent, not pure strength. Give her a bit more here. |\n| **Sled Push** (50m) | 3-4 lengths (75-100%) | 0-1 length (0-25%) | YOU dominate this. 152 kg is brutal at 120 lbs bodyweight. Your mass is your advantage — lean in and drive. |\n| **Sled Pull** (50m) | 3 lengths (75%) | 1 length (25%) | Grip + pulling strength. The 103 kg sled is heavy for her, but she should do at least one length to keep you fresh. |\n| **Burpee Broad Jumps** (80m) | 30m (37%) | 50m (63%) | This is bodyweight-based — no external load difference. She's lighter, moves faster per rep. Her lane to shine. |\n| **Rowing** (1,000m) | 450m (45%) | 550m (55%) | Technique-driven. Her lighter frame won't disadvantage her as much here. You're getting easy runs — she can row hard. |\n| **Farmer's Carry** (200m) | 150m (75%) | 50m (25%) | 2 x 24 kg = 48 kg total. That's 40% of her bodyweight. Take the lion's share. |\n| **Sandbag Lunges** (100m) | 65m (65%) | 35m (35%) | 20 kg sandbag on a 120 lb person is 37% of bodyweight. You take more, but she still contributes. |\n| **Wall Balls** (100 reps) | 40 reps (40%) | 60 reps (60%) | She throws to 2.70m (lower target). 6 kg ball is manageable for her. This is where she makes up ground. |\n\n**Training priorities over the next training block:**\n1. Run together at least once per week at her pace — this is NON-NEGOTIABLE\n2. She needs to practice sled push at 152 kg and farmer's carry at 2 x 24 kg — even if she's only doing small shares, she must be comfortable with the weight\n3. Practice your YGIG transitions — smooth switches save 10-20 seconds per station over a sloppy race\n4. Do at least 2 full simulations together before race day"}]}

How should we split stations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you're evenly matched, you have a luxury most Doubles teams don't: true flexibility. Here are three approaches ranked by competitiveness:\n\n**Option 1: The 50/50 Even Split (Safest — Good for First-Timers)**\nEach of you does exactly half of every station. 500m SkiErg each. 2 sled push lengths each (25m). 50 wall balls each. 500m row each. Simple. Predictable. No confusion on race day.\n\n**Pros:** Easy to execute, no one burns out, balanced fatigue\n**Cons:** Not the fastest strategy — longer transitions and no specialization advantage\n\n**Option 2: High-Frequency Tag-Team (Fastest — For Competitive Teams)**\nSwitch every 5-10 reps or every 100-200m. At the sled push, switch every length (12.5m each, alternating). On the row, switch every 200-250m. On wall balls, switch every 10-15 reps.\n\n**Pros:** Short work intervals = less lactate buildup. Both partners maintain higher power output because of built-in micro-recoveries. This is what the fastest Doubles teams do.\n**Cons:** More transitions = more potential for lost time if you're not practiced. Requires excellent communication.\n\n**Option 3: Energy Management Split (Strategic)**\nRegardless of equal ability, think about the ORDER of stations and what follows. Station 7 is Sandbag Lunges — whoever does the bigger share of those needs fresh legs for Run 8 and Wall Balls. Station 1 is SkiErg — this is early, everyone's fresh, so go 50/50. Station 6 is Farmer's Carry — whoever takes more here will have grip fatigue carrying into lunges.\n\n**A strategic even split might look like:**\n\n| Station | Partner A Focus | Partner B Focus |\n|---|---|---|\n| SkiErg | 50% | 50% |\n| Sled Push | 60% | 40% |\n| Sled Pull | 40% | 60% |\n| Burpee Broad Jumps | 50% | 50% |\n| Rowing | 50% | 50% |\n| Farmer's Carry | 60% | 40% |\n| Sandbag Lunges | 40% | 60% |\n| Wall Balls | 50% | 50% |\n\nThis alternates who takes the bigger share of heavy stations so neither person accumulates too much fatigue in one area.\n\n**My recommendation for equal partners:** Start with Option 1 in your first race, graduate to Option 2 if you're targeting competitive times. And remember — BOTH of you run ALL 8 x 1km together regardless of split strategy."}]}

Or do we have to decide everything before?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great tactical question. The answer is: **yes, you can absolutely adjust your split mid-race.** The official rulebook gives teams complete freedom in how they divide the work at each station. There is no pre-registration of station assignments, no required ratio, and no restriction on changing your plan during the race.\n\nHere's the exact rule from the Season 25/26 Doubles Rulebook: \"It is up to each Doubles Team member to determine how far in distance or how many reps they complete.\"\n\n**This flexibility is one of the biggest tactical advantages of Doubles. Here's how to use it:**\n\n**Pre-Race: Establish a Plan A**\nBefore the race, agree on a rough split at each station based on your strengths. Know who's taking more of the sled push, who's doing more rowing, etc. This is your baseline.\n\n**During the Race: Read and React**\n- If your partner is gassing out on the runs and their heart rate is spiking, take a bigger share of the next station to give them recovery\n- If you're feeling great after a run but your partner is struggling, tell them: \"I've got 70% of this one, you rest\"\n- If grip is failing for one of you at farmer's carry, the other takes more distance\n- If one partner's form is breaking down on wall balls, switch more frequently to keep quality high\n\n**Establish Communication Protocols in Training:**\n- Simple verbal cues: \"I got this\" (I'm taking more), \"Tag\" (your turn), \"60/40 me\" (I'll take the bigger share)\n- Hand signals for noisy venues\n- A \"bailout\" word if one person is hitting a wall and needs to take a minimal share\n\n**What you CANNOT change:**\n- Running. Both partners run ALL 8 x 1km together. No adjustments, no exceptions. That part is locked in.\n\n**Pro tip from experienced Doubles racers:** The teams that lose the most time aren't the ones with bad splits — they're the ones who can't communicate and adapt. Having a Plan A is important. Having the ability to shift to Plan B on the fly is what separates good teams from great teams.\n\nPractice at least 2 simulation sessions where you intentionally change the split mid-race to get comfortable with the adjustment."}]}

But there ARE stations where raw strength matters less and technique or aerobic capacity matters more. And remember — both of you go to all 8 stations. You're not assigning separate stations; you're deciding who takes a bigger share of the YGIG split at each one.\n\n**Station Difficulty Breakdown by Demand Type:**\n\n**Technique + Aerobic (less dependent on raw strength):**\n- **SkiErg** (1,000m) — Technique-driven. If your partner learns proper lat engagement and hip hinge, they can be efficient here regardless of strength. It's cardiovascularly demanding but not brutally heavy.\n- **Rowing** (1,000m) — Same concept. Technique and aerobic engine matter more than pure power. A lighter, technically sound rower can match or beat a stronger but inefficient one.\n- **Burpee Broad Jumps** (80m) — Entirely bodyweight. A lighter athlete actually has an advantage — less mass to push off the ground and propel forward. This is often the most \"equal\" station for mixed-size teams.\n\n**Muscular Endurance + Cardio (moderate strength demand):**\n- **Wall Balls** (100 reps) — Requires sustained quad endurance and shoulder stamina. The ball weights vary by division (4-9 kg). It's not about being strong — it's about not breaking. A partner with a solid aerobic base can grind through this.\n\n**High Strength Demand (where your stronger partner should take more):**\n- **Sled Push** (50m) — Bodyweight and raw strength are king. Heavier athletes have a massive advantage.\n- **Sled Pull** (50m) — Grip strength + upper body pulling power. The rope work is relentless.\n- **Farmer's Carry** (200m) — Grip endurance + core stability under load. Total weight is 32-64 kg depending on division.\n- **Sandbag Lunges** (100m) — Leg strength under load + balance. The sandbag (10-30 kg) sits on the shoulders and punishes the quads.\n\n**If your partner is \"weaker,\" have them take a bigger share of:** SkiErg, Rowing, Burpee Broad Jumps, Wall Balls\n**Have your stronger partner take more of:** Sled Push, Sled Pull, Farmer's Carry, Sandbag Lunges\n\nBut \"weaker\" partner still contributes at every station. Even 20-30% at the heavy stations gives the stronger partner micro-recoveries that keep their output high. That's the whole point of YGIG."}]}

How should we approach this?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is a common pairing and it works great IF you manage expectations and preparation correctly. Your experience is a massive advantage — but only if you use it to prepare your partner, not overwhelm them.\n\n**Priority 1: The Running (Non-Negotiable)**\nBoth of you run ALL 8 x 1km together. This is where first-timers get the biggest shock. Your partner has never experienced the feeling of running 1km, doing a brutal station, then immediately running 1km again — eight times in a row. The cumulative fatigue is unlike anything else.\n\n**Training together is critical.** Do at least 4-5 sessions of running together at a matched pace before race day. Your partner needs to internalize what a sustainable Hyrox running pace feels like. Too fast early = death spiral by station 5.\n\n**Priority 2: Station Familiarization**\nYour partner needs hands-on practice with every station at race weights BEFORE race day. This isn't optional. Things that will shock a first-timer:\n- How heavy 152 kg (or 102 kg for women) feels on a sled push on competition surface\n- How quickly grip fails on the sled pull rope\n- How the 80m of burpee broad jumps feels 5km into a race\n- How 100 wall balls feels in the 7th station\n\nGet them into a Hyrox gym simulation or build your own. Practice every station. Time each one.\n\n**Priority 3: Assign Them Stations They're Most Comfortable With**\nDuring your simulation sessions, you'll quickly identify which stations your partner feels confident at. Give them a larger share of THOSE stations and take more of the ones they struggle with. This builds their confidence and keeps the race moving.\n\n**Suggested approach for experienced + first-timer:**\n\n| Your Role (Experienced) | Their Role (First-Timer) |\n|---|---|\n| Take 60-70% of heavy/technical stations (sled push, sled pull) | Take 50-60% of technique/cardio stations (SkiErg, rowing, wall balls) |\n| Set the running pace (don't let them go too fast in Run 1-3) | Focus on rhythm, breathing, staying calm |\n| Call all transitions — \"I'm in,\" \"Your turn,\" \"10 more reps then switch\" | Follow your lead, focus on effort, communicate if struggling |\n| Manage pacing across the whole race | Trust your partner's game plan |\n\n**Priority 4: Race Day Mindset**\nBrief them on what to expect: the noise, the crowd, the heat in the venue, the adrenaline dump at the start that makes everyone go out too fast. Your biggest job as the experienced partner is being the calming voice that keeps you both on plan.\n\nYour 3 races of experience means you know where the race gets hard (Station 5-6 is the grind), what \"too fast\" feels like in Run 1, and how to pace for a negative split. That knowledge is worth more than any physical advantage."}]}

Neither of us is particularly strong. What should our game plan be?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your running advantage is your superpower in Doubles — and it's a bigger advantage than most people realize. Let me explain why, then give you the plan.\n\n**Why Runners Dominate Doubles:**\nIn Hyrox, running accounts for roughly 50-60% of your total race time. In Doubles, BOTH of you run ALL 8 x 1km. Your 8km of running will be faster and more comfortable than most teams. While other Doubles teams are grinding through 5:30-6:00/km runs, you'll be cruising at 4:30-5:00/km and barely breaking zone 2. That's 8-12 minutes of time savings just from the runs — before you even touch a station.\n\n**The Stations Are Your Weakness — Here's the Plan:**\n\nYou have 8-12 weeks to get race-ready at the stations. Focus your strength training on the four stations that punish weakness the hardest:\n\n1. **Sled Push** — This is where runners struggle most. It's pure strength + bodyweight. Practice at race weight (152 kg for men's open) at least twice per week. Use a prowler or sled in the gym. If your gym doesn't have one, heavy leg press + heavy squats simulate the demand pattern.\n\n2. **Sled Pull** — Grip strength + upper body pulling. Add heavy barbell rows, face pulls, and dead hangs (3 x max hang time) to your program. Practice rope pulling technique specifically.\n\n3. **Farmer's Carry** — Grip endurance. Carry the exact race weight (2 x 24 kg for men's open) for 200m without stopping. Build to this over 6-8 weeks.\n\n4. **Sandbag Lunges** — Quad endurance under load. Goblet squats, Bulgarian split squats, and walking lunges with a sandbag on your shoulders.\n\n**Your YGIG Station Split Strategy:**\n\nSince you're both equally \"not strong,\" split every station 50/50 and use high-frequency switching. Here's why:\n\n| Station | Strategy | Switching Frequency |\n|---|---|---|\n| SkiErg | 50/50 — you'll both crush this | Switch every 250m |\n| Sled Push | 50/50 — alternate lengths | Every 12.5m length |\n| Sled Pull | 50/50 — alternate lengths | Every 12.5m length |\n| Burpee Broad Jumps | 50/50 — bodyweight, no weakness | Every 20m |\n| Rowing | 50/50 — you'll both crush this | Switch every 250m |\n| Farmer's Carry | 50/50 — grip is limiting for both | Switch every 50m (or sooner if grip fails) |\n| Sandbag Lunges | 50/50 — alternating gives quad rest | Switch every 25m |\n| Wall Balls | 50/50 — use your endurance | Switch every 20-25 reps |\n\n**The high-frequency switching is KEY for you.** Short intervals (12.5m sled push, 25m lunges, 20 reps wall balls) prevent either of you from hitting the muscular failure point. Your aerobic engines recover quickly during the rest intervals — that's your competitive edge. You'll push the sled at a higher average speed with 4 quick switches than one person grinding 25m at a time.\n\n**Race day goal:** Use your running speed to bank time, execute stations cleanly with disciplined YGIG switching, and don't let ego make either of you try to \"hero\" an entire station."}]}

If your partner needs sled work, they practice sled push/pull. If you need wall ball endurance, you drill that. Everyone maintains their running base individually. This is where you build the engine.\n\n**Together Sessions (1-2x/week):**\nThis is where you build the TEAM. Here's what you focus on:\n\n**Session Type 1: Matched-Pace Runs (Weekly)**\n- Run 4-8 x 1km together at the slower partner's sustainable pace\n- 90-second rest between intervals (simulates station time)\n- Goal: learn each other's rhythm, practice pacing, get comfortable running side by side\n- Start at 4 intervals, build to 8 over the training block\n- THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT DOUBLES-SPECIFIC TRAINING YOU CAN DO\n\n**Session Type 2: Station Practice + YGIG Transitions (Weekly)**\n- Set up 2-3 stations at race weight\n- Practice your planned YGIG split: Partner A works, switch, Partner B works, switch\n- Time everything. Log station times AND transition times.\n- Focus on smooth switches — clean handoffs at farmer's carry, quick mount/dismount at rower\n- Practice communication cues: \"Go!\" \"Tag!\" \"Five more!\" \"I got next!\"\n\n**Session Type 3: Full Simulation (Monthly)**\n- Once per month, do a full or half race simulation together\n- Both run 1km → YGIG at Station 1 → Run 1km → YGIG at Station 2 → Continue\n- Full sim = 8 runs + 8 stations. Half sim = 4 runs + 4 stations\n- Record ALL splits: run times, station times, transition times\n- Debrief afterward: what worked, what didn't, where did you lose time?\n\n**Week-by-Week Together Training Plan (12-week example):**\n\n| Weeks | Together Sessions | Focus |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1-4 | 1x/week: Matched-pace runs only | Build running rhythm, establish communication |\n| 5-8 | 2x/week: 1 run session + 1 station practice | Add YGIG practice, test station splits |\n| 9-10 | 2x/week: 1 run + 1 full simulation | Full race dress rehearsal, refine strategy |\n| 11-12 | 1x/week: Easy together run + visualization | Taper, light practice, race prep |\n\n**Non-negotiable:** At minimum, run together 6-8 times before race day.

Focus on 1km repeats at your target race pace (4:30-5:30/km depending on your level).\n\n2. **Station-specific training** — Each person practices all 8 stations at race weight. Yes, ALL 8 — because both of you do all 8 stations in Doubles (YGIG). Pay extra attention to the stations where you'll take a bigger share.\n\n3. **Strength and conditioning** — Each person follows their own program targeting their weaknesses.\n\n4. **Individual simulations** — Run through a simulated Hyrox solo to gauge fitness. Time each station. Share data with your partner.\n\n**What You MUST Do Together (The Non-Negotiable Minimums):**\n\n| Session | When | Purpose |\n|---|---|---|\n| Together Run #1 | 6-8 weeks out | Establish matched running pace. This is the most critical session. |\n| Together Run #2 | 4-5 weeks out | Confirm pacing, practice running side by side at race effort |\n| Full Simulation #1 | 3-4 weeks out | Complete race rehearsal with YGIG at all stations. Time everything. |\n| Together Run #3 | 2-3 weeks out | Final pace confirmation, test communication cues |\n| Full Simulation #2 | 2 weeks out | Final dress rehearsal. Race-weight stations. Full 8 runs + 8 stations. |\n\nThat's 5 sessions together, minimum. I'd strongly recommend making at least 2 of those happen. If you can only get together twice, make it the two full simulations at 4 weeks and 2 weeks out.\n\n**Remote Coordination Plan:**\n\n1. **Share a training spreadsheet** — Both log every session. Track running paces, station times, and bodyweight.\n2. **Video each other's station technique** — Especially sled push form, wall ball depth, rowing stroke. Give feedback remotely.\n3. **Agree on a station split plan** — Based on your individual station times, decide who takes more of what. A partner who rows 1,000m in 3:40 should take more of the rowing than one who does it in 4:10.\n4. **Match your running paces remotely** — The slower partner sets the pace. The faster partner practices running at that exact pace during their solo 1km repeats.\n5. **Practice communication cues** — Agree on verbal signals: \"Go!\" \"Switch!\" \"I'm taking 60 here!\" \"Need a break!\"\n\n**The running-together practice is truly non-negotiable.** I've seen teams where both individuals were fit enough to finish well, but they'd never run together. On race day, the faster partner kept surging ahead unconsciously, the slower partner kept trying to match and burning out, and they accumulated three 1-minute penalties before station 5.

START CONSERVATIVE. |\n| **Station 1: SkiErg** | 1,000m YGIG | Suggested: switch every 250m. Record total station time. |\n| **Run 2** | 1km together | Same pace as Run 1. Settle into rhythm. |\n| **Station 2: Sled Push** | 50m YGIG (4 x 12.5m) | Alternate lengths or split by plan. Record time. |\n| **Run 3** | 1km together | |\n| **Station 3: Sled Pull** | 50m YGIG (4 x 12.5m) | Hand-over-hand only. Record time. |\n| **Run 4** | 1km together | Check in with partner: \"How are you feeling?\" |\n| **Station 4: Burpee Broad Jumps** | 80m YGIG | Switch every 20m or as planned. Chest to floor, full jump. |\n| **Run 5** | 1km together | This is the halfway grind. Stay disciplined on pace. |\n| **Station 5: Rowing** | 1,000m YGIG | Switch every 250m. Record split times. |\n| **Run 6** | 1km together | |\n| **Station 6: Farmer's Carry** | 200m YGIG | Switch every 50m or when grip fails. No putting down. |\n| **Run 7** | 1km together | Legs will feel heavy after farmer's carry. Expected. |\n| **Station 7: Sandbag Lunges** | 100m YGIG | Switch every 25m. Knee must touch ground. |\n| **Run 8** | 1km together | LAST RUN. Push together. This is where you find out if your pacing was right. |\n| **Station 8: Wall Balls** | 100 reps YGIG | Switch every 20-25 reps. Full squat depth, ball hits target. |\n\n**Cool-down:** 5 min easy walk together, then stretch.\n\n**Data to Record:**\n\n| Metric | Your Time | Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n| Total time | _____ | |\n| Each run split (x8) | _____ | Watch for pace drift (getting slower) |\n| Each station time (x8) | _____ | Include transition time |\n| Total running time | _____ | Should be ~45-55% of total time |\n| Total station time | _____ | |\n| Transitions | _____ | Time between finishing a run and starting a station |\n\n**After the simulation, debrief:**\n1. Which stations were slowest? Those need more practice.\n2. Did your run pace hold steady or did it drift? If splits got worse after station 5, you went out too hard.\n3. Were YGIG transitions smooth or did you lose time fumbling?\n4. Did you stay within arm's reach on all runs?\n5. What's your target time improvement for race day?\n\nDo this simulation at least twice: once at 4 weeks out, once at 2 weeks out. The first one is diagnostic. The second one is confirmation."}]}

You're the anchor. |\n| Sled Pull | 37.5m | 12.5m | Same — grip and pulling strength |\n| Burpee Broad Jumps | 30m | 50m | Bodyweight — she's light and F45-conditioned |\n| Rowing | 450m | 550m | Technique station, good for her |\n| Farmer's Carry | 150m | 50m | 2 x 24 kg is significant for her. You carry the load. |\n| Sandbag Lunges | 65m | 35m | 20 kg at her size is proportionally heavy |\n| Wall Balls | 40 reps | 60 reps | 6 kg to 2.70m target — she can handle this |\n\nThis gives you roughly 60% of the heavy station work and her 55% of the cardio/endurance stations.

Practice INDIVIDUALLY. 1x/week together for matched-pace running. |\n| 4-6 | **YGIG Integration** | 2x/week together: matched-pace runs + station YGIG practice. Test different station splits.

Debrief and finalize race strategy. |\n| 8 | **Taper + Race** | Reduce volume by 40-50%. One easy together run Monday. Light station touch-ups Wednesday. RACE. |\n\n**Optimal Training Block: 12 Weeks**\n\n| Weeks | Phase | Focus |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1-4 | **Individual Foundation** | Build fitness independently. Learn every station. 1x/week together runs. Focus on the slower runner's pace development. |\n| 5-8 | **Race Specificity** | 2x/week together. Full YGIG practice at race weights. Half-simulations. Nail down your station split strategy. Address individual weaknesses with targeted training. |\n| 9-10 | **Full Simulations** | Two complete race simulations. First one is diagnostic — identify problems. Second one is dress rehearsal — execute your plan. |\n| 11 | **Sharpening** | Reduce volume. One together session focused on the 2-3 stations that need polishing. Light running. |\n| 12 | **Taper + Race** | Minimal training. One easy together run early in the week. Mental preparation. RACE. |\n\n**Key Milestones to Hit Before Race Day:**\n1. Run together at matched pace at least 6-8 times (non-negotiable)\n2. Practice every station at race weight at least 4-5 times each\n3. Complete at least 2 full simulations together\n4. Have a finalized YGIG split that both partners are comfortable with\n5. Practice communication cues until they're automatic\n\n**Red Flags That You Need More Time:**\n- Either partner cannot complete 8km of running (even slowly)\n- Either partner has never touched a sled, SkiErg, or rower\n- You've never practiced YGIG transitions\n- Running paces are more than 1:30/km apart (this needs significant adjustment)\n\n**The Most Common Training Mistake in Doubles:**\nPartners train individually and feel great, then show up to race day having never actually practiced the Doubles-specific elements — running together, YGIG switching, communication under fatigue. The individual fitness is there, but the team skills are missing. That's why the \"together\" sessions are the backbone of this plan. Don't skip them."}]}

It's different from Doubles right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Completely different format. Let me lay it out clearly because people constantly confuse the two.\n\n**HYROX RELAY FORMAT:**\n\n**Team Size:** 4 athletes\n\n**How it works:** The same overall Hyrox race structure — 8 x 1km runs + 8 workout stations — but divided among 4 people. Each person runs **2 x 1km** and does **2 complete stations** (100% of each station, no splitting). Only ONE teammate is on the course at a time.\n\n**The Race Flow:**\n- Teammate 1 runs 1km → does Station 1 (100% solo) → enters Transition Zone\n- Teammate 2 gets a shoulder tap → runs 1km → does Station 2 (100% solo) → Transition Zone\n- Continue through all 4 teammates until all 8 runs + 8 stations are done\n\n**Transition Zone:**\n- Located inside the Roxzone\n- One teammate at a time in the TZ (until the actual exchange)\n- Exchange protocol: finishing athlete enters TZ → **taps next athlete on the shoulder** → exits → next athlete starts running\n- If one athlete does consecutive legs back-to-back, they still must run through the TZ for timing purposes\n\n**Key Differences from Doubles:**\n\n| | Doubles (2 people) | Relay (4 people) |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Running per person** | **ALL 8km (both run every run)** | **~2km (2 runs each)** |\n| **Stations per person** | All 8 stations (split YGIG) | 2 complete stations (100% each) |\n| **Partners on course** | Both always together | Only 1 at a time |\n| **Station work** | YGIG split between 2 | One person does entire station |\n| **Running rule** | MUST stay together | Only 1 runs at a time |\n\n**Relay Teams Available:**\n- Men's Relay (4 males)\n- Women's Relay (4 females)\n- Mixed Relay (2 males + 2 females)\n\n**Important:** In Mixed Relay, each athlete uses the weight for their OWN gender. So the two female athletes use Women's Open weights and the two males use Men's Open weights. This is different from Mixed Doubles, where both partners use Men's Open weights.\n\nRelay is the most \"accessible\" Hyrox format — each person only runs 2km and does 2 stations. It's a great entry point for teams where not everyone has full Hyrox fitness. Doubles is much more demanding per person because you run the full 8km."}]}

We have two strong runners, one powerhouse lifter, and one all-arounder."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Smart question — Relay is the one Hyrox format where strategic assignment makes a massive difference because each person does 100% of their stations (no YGIG splitting). Let me build your assignment.\n\n**Your Team Profile:**\n- Runner 1 (strong runner)\n- Runner 2 (strong runner)\n- Lifter (powerhouse)\n- All-Rounder (solid at everything)\n\n**Station Assignment Strategy:**\n\nThe 8 stations in order:\n1. SkiErg (1,000m)\n2. Sled Push (50m)\n3. Sled Pull (50m)\n4. Burpee Broad Jumps (80m)\n5. Rowing (1,000m)\n6. Farmer's Carry (200m)\n7. Sandbag Lunges (100m)\n8. Wall Balls (100 reps)\n\nEach person runs the 1km immediately BEFORE their station and does 100% of that station solo. Each person does this twice.\n\n**Optimal Assignment:**\n\n| Athlete | Station Leg 1 | Station Leg 2 | Why |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Runner 1** | Station 1: SkiErg | Station 4: Burpee Broad Jumps | SkiErg is aerobic — runner's bread and butter. BBJ is bodyweight — a fit runner handles this well. Runner goes first while fresh, then comes back for Station 4. |\n| **Lifter** | Station 2: Sled Push | Station 6: Farmer's Carry | These are the two most strength-dependent stations. You want your strongest person on the 152 kg (or 202 kg pro) sled and the heavy farmer's carry. Back-to-back would be brutal, so spacing them apart is smart. |\n| **All-Rounder** | Station 3: Sled Pull | Station 7: Sandbag Lunges | Sled pull needs grip + pulling power. Lunges need leg endurance. The all-rounder handles both competently. These are mid-difficulty stations that don't require pure specialization. |\n| **Runner 2** | Station 5: Rowing | Station 8: Wall Balls | Rowing is heavily aerobic — right in a runner's wheelhouse. Wall Balls at Station 8 is the finisher — you want someone with a motor who can grind through 100 reps at the end. Plus, a strong runner as the anchor means your last two runs are fast. |\n\n**Why This Order Works:**\n1. Runner 1 starts the race — fast 1km opening sets a tone\n2. Lifter tackles the heaviest stations — sled push and farmer's carry — without running much distance beforehand\n3. All-Rounder handles the middle of the race — steady, reliable\n4. Runner 2 anchors — fast runs to close it out, and the rowing station plays to their aerobic strength\n\n**Running Pacing:**\nEach person runs ~2km total (2 x 1km). Unlike Doubles, you DON'T have to match anyone's pace — you run YOUR pace. Runners should target near-race-pace 1km efforts (sub-4:30 if possible). Lifter and all-rounder should target sustainable efforts (4:45-5:15/km).\n\n**Training Focus (Each Person):**\n- Practice your 2 assigned stations at race weight, repeatedly\n- Do 2-3 full relay simulations as a team before race day\n- Practice the transition zone shoulder-tap — smooth transitions save 10-15 seconds each\n\n**One last thing:** Make sure the person doing Station 7 (Sandbag Lunges) has enough leg freshness for the final run. Those lunges at 100m with a 20-30 kg sandbag will torch the quads. The all-rounder is a good choice here because they're balanced enough to push through."}]}

Male RM — Sled Push 152kg, Sled Pull 103kg, Farmers Carry 2x24kg, Sandbag 20kg, Wall Balls 6kg/3.00m. In Mixed Relay, each athlete uses weights for their OWN gender (unlike Mixed Doubles).\n---"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What weights does Hyrox Relay use? Are they the same as Singles?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Relay uses **Open division weights**, and they're gender-specific. Here's the full breakdown:\n\n**Relay Weight Table (Season 25/26):**\n\n| Station | Female Relay Member | Male Relay Member |\n|---|---|---|\n| SkiErg | 1,000m | 1,000m |\n| Sled Push | 102 kg (incl. sled) | 152 kg (incl. sled) |\n| Sled Pull | 78 kg (incl. sled) | 103 kg (incl. sled) |\n| Burpee Broad Jumps | 80m | 80m |\n| Rowing | 1,000m | 1,000m |\n| Farmer's Carry | 2 x 16 kg | 2 x 24 kg |\n| Sandbag Lunges | 10 kg | 20 kg |\n| Wall Balls | 100 reps / 4 kg / 2.70m target | 100 reps / 6 kg / 3.00m target |\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. **Relay weights = Singles Open weights.** They're identical. Same sled, same farmer's carry handles, same sandbag, same wall balls. Nothing lighter.\n\n2. **Each Relay Member does 100% of their stations** — no splitting. So when a male RM does Sled Push, he pushes the full 50m of 152 kg by himself. No partner to share with.\n\n3. **Mixed Relay: each athlete uses their OWN gender's weights.** If your team is 2 males + 2 females, the females use 102 kg sled push and 2 x 16 kg farmer's carry, while the males use 152 kg and 2 x 24 kg. This is DIFFERENT from Mixed Doubles, where both partners use Men's Open weights.\n\n**This means Mixed Relay is strategically interesting:**\n- You can assign your female teammates to the stations where the weight difference matters most (sled push = 102 vs 152 kg is a 50 kg difference)\n- And assign male teammates to stations where the weight difference is smaller (wall balls = 6 vs 4 kg, only 2 kg difference) or where their absolute strength gives an advantage\n\n**Practical implication for team planning:** The total station work is the same as Singles. The difference is that each person only does 2 stations (100% of each), so fatigue management is less of a concern within stations but the run-to-station transition is critical since each person runs hard and immediately works."}]}

Here's the hit list, ranked by how much time they cost:\n\n**Mistake #1: Not Practicing Running Together (Cost: 3-8 minutes + penalty risk)**\nThis is the single biggest mistake. Teams train individually, feel fit, show up on race day, and realize they've never actually run side by side at a matched pace. The faster partner unconsciously surges on every run. The slower partner tries to keep up and blows up by Run 4. Result: 1-minute penalties for separating, erratic pacing, and the slower partner entering stations already gassed.\n\n**Fix:** Run together at least 6-8 times before race day. Lock into the slower partner's pace from Run 1.\n\n**Mistake #2: Not Knowing the YGIG Rules (Cost: Confusion + wasted time)**\nTeams show up thinking they each \"take\" 4 stations, or they can both work at the same time, or they can help each other. None of this is true. Both partners go to all 8 stations. One works at a time. No physical assistance.\n\n**Fix:** Read the rulebook. Practice YGIG transitions at every station.\n\n**Mistake #3: Unbalanced Station Split That Doesn't Account for Running Fatigue (Cost: 2-5 minutes)**\nThe faster runner takes 50% of station work even though they're running at 70% effort. Meanwhile the slower runner is running at 90% effort AND doing 50% of stations. By Station 5, the slower partner is destroyed.\n\n**Fix:** The partner who runs easier should take a BIGGER share of station work (55-65%). The effort evens out across the race.\n\n**Mistake #4: Starting Too Fast on Runs Because \"It Feels Easy With a Partner\" (Cost: 2-4 minutes in the back half)**\nThe adrenaline of racing with a partner makes Runs 1-3 feel effortless. Teams run 4:30/km when their plan was 5:15/km. By Run 5, they're paying for it. Hyrox is an 8-round fight — you don't sprint the first round.\n\n**Fix:** Set a target pace in training and stick to it. The slower partner should be the pacemaker. Use a watch.\n\n**Mistake #5: Sloppy YGIG Transitions (Cost: 30-90 seconds total)**\nFumbling the switch between partners at each station. Not knowing where to stand. Dropping the sandbag or kettlebells. Trying a \"flying transition\" on wall balls (which is a no-rep). Each sloppy transition costs 3-5 seconds, and across 8 stations with multiple switches each, it adds up.\n\n**Fix:** Practice transitions at every station. Know the rules: you can't pass SkiErg or rower handles. Kettlebells and sandbag pass sideways or backwards, never forward. Wall ball transitions go through the floor or a hand-off.\n\n**Mistake #6: Non-Working Partner Wasting Their Rest (Cost: Fatigue accumulation)**\nInstead of using partner's work time for active recovery — controlled breathing, heart rate management, mental preparation — the resting partner is pacing nervously, standing tensely, or burning adrenaline. Those 30-90 second rest windows are gold.\n\n**Fix:** Resting partner: hands on knees, controlled breathing, lower heart rate. Shout encouragement to your partner. Count their reps. But keep YOUR body recovering.\n\n**Mistake #7: Not Having a Backup Plan (Cost: Race-ending frustration)**\nIf the planned split isn't working — say your partner's grip fails at farmer's carry and they can only do 30m instead of 100m — teams that can't adapt lose minutes arguing or scrambling.\n\n**Fix:** Plan A is your target split. Plan B is \"if one of us is struggling, the other takes 70-80% of the next station.\" Discuss this before the race."}]}

This is the part people get wrong the most, and it's the most important thing to understand about Doubles.\n\n2. **The station VOLUME:** Every station has the same total work as Singles. 1,000m SkiErg. 50m sled push. 100 wall balls. Nothing is reduced. The total work is divided between partners using YGIG (You Go / I Go), but the race demands the same total output.\n\n3. **The weights:** Doubles Open = Singles Open weights. Doubles Pro = Singles Pro weights. Identical. The sled still weighs 152 kg (men's open). The farmer's carry is still 2 x 24 kg. Nothing changes.\n\n**What IS different:**\n\n1. **Station work is shared:** You split the reps/distance at each station. If you go 50/50, each person does roughly 500m of SkiErg, 25m of sled push, 50 wall balls, etc. This is the \"half\" your friend is thinking of.\n\n2. **Built-in rest at stations:** While your partner works, you rest. These micro-recoveries (30-90 seconds per switch) are a significant advantage. You can push harder per work interval because you know a rest is coming.\n\n3. **Running pace is typically slower:** Because both partners must stay together (within 5 seconds), the faster partner runs below their capability. The trade-off is that the faster partner is fresher for stations.\n\n**Here's the math that proves it's NOT half:**\n\nRunning is roughly 50-60% of your total Hyrox time. That's the SAME in Doubles. If your 8 x 1km running takes 42 minutes in Singles and 44 minutes in Doubles (slightly slower pace matching your partner), you're running nearly the same volume of work.\n\nStation work is split — so you're doing roughly 50% of station work, which accounts for maybe 40-50% of race time. You save maybe 15-20 minutes at stations compared to doing them solo.\n\n**Net result:** Doubles finish times are typically 10-20 minutes faster than individual times for similar-level athletes. NOT 50% faster. If \"half a Hyrox\" were true, a 75-minute singles athlete would finish Doubles in ~37 minutes. That doesn't happen. Competitive Doubles teams finish in 55-65 minutes — because the running volume is identical.\n\n**Tell your friend this:** If Doubles were half a Hyrox, sign up for Singles and see how the full 8km of running plus 8 full stations feels. Then come back and tell me Doubles is \"easy.\" The running alone makes it a full endurance event. The stations are a bonus, not the main event.\n\nAnd if he still doesn't believe you, point out the penalty structure: if Doubles were really half the effort, Hyrox wouldn't need a system that disqualifies teams for not staying together on runs. The rules exist BECAUSE the running is the hard part."}]}
