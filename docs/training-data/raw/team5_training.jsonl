How should I structure the overall periodization?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Sixteen weeks is the sweet spot for Hyrox prep. Here's how I break it into four distinct phases, each with a specific physiological purpose:\n\n**Phase 1: General Preparation (Weeks 1-4)**\nPrimary goal is building your aerobic engine and introducing all 8 Hyrox station movements at sub-race loads. You'll run 35-38 miles per week across 5 runs, hit 2 strength sessions, and do 2 HIIT sessions. Running dominates this phase — 80% Zone 2, 10% tempo, 10% intervals. Station loads sit at 80% of race weight (e.g., 122 kg sled push instead of 152 kg).\n\n**Phase 2: Specific Preparation (Weeks 5-8)**\nThis is where it gets Hyrox-specific. Station loads jump to 90% race weight, you add a 3rd HIIT session, and you introduce compromised running — running immediately after station work. Mileage holds at 36-40 mpw. You'll do your first half-simulation in Week 8.\n\n**Phase 3: Competition Prep (Weeks 9-12)**\nEverything hits race specifications. Stations go to 100% race weight, full race distances. HIIT sessions peak in complexity with 20-40 minute pieces and work:rest ratios tightening to 1:0.5. You'll do a full 8-station simulation in Week 10 — your highest-volume session of the entire plan. One strength session drops to maintenance-only.\n\n**Phase 4: Taper & Peak (Weeks 13-16)**\nVolume drops 20-30% but intensity stays sharp. Mileage falls from 32 down to 15 miles in race week. HIIT goes from 2 sessions to 1 to zero. You maintain race-weight station touchpoints but at 50% volume. The goal: arrive on race day fresh, fast, and confident.\n\n**Every 4th week (Weeks 4, 8, 12) is a deload** — running volume drops 20-25%, HIIT sets cut by 30-40%, strength volume halved. Week 16 is a super-deload leading into race day.\n\nThis structure follows the classic general-to-specific periodization model. You build the engine first, then teach it to do Hyrox-specific work, then sharpen it for race day."}]}

I want to understand how volume builds."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Here's the exact weekly volume progression for Phase 1 (General Prep, Weeks 1-4):\n\n| Week | Running (miles) | Runs/wk | Strength | HIIT | Total Training Days |\n|------|----------------|---------|----------|------|---------------------|\n| 1 | 35 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 6 |\n| 2 | 36 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 6 |\n| 3 | 38 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 6 |\n| 4 (Deload) | 30 | 4 | 2 (half vol) | 2 (half vol) | 5 |\n\n**The build rate is ~5-8% per week** for the first 3 weeks, then a 20-25% drop on the deload. This is textbook progressive overload — your body adapts to a stimulus, you increase it slightly, then you back off to let the adaptation consolidate.\n\n**Running intensity mix during Phase 1:** 80% Zone 2, 10% tempo, 10% intervals. That means out of 5 weekly runs, roughly 3 are easy, 1 is a tempo, and your long run is easy with the option to add strides.\n\n**Station loads in Phase 1:** Everything sits at 80% of race weight. Sled push at 122 kg instead of 152 kg. Sled pull at 82 kg instead of 103 kg. Wall balls are sets of 15-25 reps (not the full 100). BBJ distance is 20-40 meters per session. The focus is movement skill acquisition — learning proper sled angle, wall ball catch rhythm, and lunge stride length — not grinding through race-volume work.\n\n**Strength stays heavy:** Back Squat 4x5 at 80% 1RM progressing to 4x3 at 85% by Week 3. This is your last phase of traditional strength building before we shift to strength-endurance rep ranges in Phase 2.\n\nWeek 4's deload also includes a baseline benchmark test — a partial simulation (4 stations + 4 km) to establish your starting point. You need those numbers to track progress."}]}

When should they happen?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Deload weeks are non-negotiable. They're where the actual adaptation happens — you stress the body for 3 weeks, then back off so it can rebuild stronger. Skip them and you're just accumulating fatigue without ever cashing in the fitness gains.\n\n**When they happen:** Every 4th week — Weeks 4, 8, and 12. Week 16 is race week, which functions as a super-deload.\n\n**What changes during a deload:**\n- Running volume drops 20-25% (e.g., from 38 miles to 30 miles)\n- HIIT session count drops from 3 to 2, with volume per session cut by 30-40% (fewer sets, not fewer movements)\n- Strength intensity is maintained at 85-90% of working loads but volume is halved — 2 sets instead of 4\n- No race simulations during deload (exception: Week 4 deload includes a baseline benchmark, and Week 8 deload includes a half-sim, but these replace a training session rather than adding to load)\n- One extra rest or active recovery day added\n\n**What stays the same:** Movement quality, session structure, and the specific movements you're training. You're reducing the dose, not changing the prescription.\n\n**Why this matters for Hyrox specifically:** You're training 6 days per week across running, strength, and HIIT — three different energy system demands competing for recovery resources. This is concurrent training at its most aggressive. Without planned deloads, your running will stagnate, your HIIT quality will drop, and your injury risk skyrockets. The research on concurrent training is clear: the interference effect is real, and deloads are how you manage it.\n\n**Pro tip:** Use deload weeks for benchmarking. Week 4 gives you a partial simulation baseline. Week 8 gives you a half-sim comparison. Week 12 gives you a three-quarter sim. You're testing when you're freshest within each training block."}]}

Here's the exact breakdown:\n\n**Sled Push:**\n- Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): **122 kg** (80% of race weight), 2 x 50 m per session\n- Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): **137 kg** (90% of race weight), 4 x 50 m per session\n- Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12): **152 kg** (100% race weight), 4 x 50 m per session\n- Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16): **152 kg** (100% race weight), 2 x 50 m per session\n\n**Sled Pull:**\n- Phase 1: **82 kg** (80%), 2 x 50 m\n- Phase 2: **93 kg** (90%), 4 x 50 m\n- Phase 3: **103 kg** (100%), 4 x 50 m\n- Phase 4: **103 kg** (100%), 2 x 50 m\n\n**Why this specific progression:** Two variables are increasing simultaneously — load AND volume. In Phase 1 you're doing 100 total meters at 80% weight. By Phase 3 you're doing 200 total meters at 100% weight. That's a massive jump in total work, which is why the load increase is gradual rather than jumping straight to race weight.\n\nPhase 4 flips the script: you keep race weight to maintain neuromuscular familiarity but cut volume by 50%. Your body needs to remember what 152 kg feels like, but it doesn't need the training stimulus anymore — it needs freshness.\n\n**Critical coaching point:** If your gym sled weighs differently from the race sled (~52 kg base weight), do the math and load accordingly. A 152 kg total means roughly 100 kg of added plates on a standard sled. Get this right — training with the wrong load is a waste of your time."}]}

It's running immediately after completing a station — when your legs are full of lactate, your heart rate is elevated, and your biomechanics want to fall apart. This is what separates Hyrox from a regular road race.\n\n**When you start:** Phase 2 (Week 5). Not before. Here's why — Phase 1 builds your aerobic base and teaches you the station movements. If you add compromised running before those foundations are solid, you're just practicing being bad at two things simultaneously.\n\n**How it progresses:**\n- Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): **Zero compromised runs.** Focus on clean movement patterns and aerobic development.\n- Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): **1 per week.** Typically a 2.5-mile easy run immediately after a lower body strength session. You'll also start seeing runs embedded within HIIT sessions.\n- Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12): **2 per week**, integrated within HIIT sessions. Each session includes 2-4 km of running between stations. This is where you practice maintaining your goal race pace (4:30-4:45/km) with heavy legs.\n- Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16): **1 per week** within reduced-volume HIIT. Maintain the skill, don't accumulate fatigue.\n\n**The training application:** In Phase 2, after a strength session of Front Squats 3x8 at 72%, DB Walking Lunges 3x10/leg, and Farmer Holds, you immediately lace up and run 2.5 miles easy. Your legs will scream for the first half mile. That's the point — you're teaching your body to flush lactate while maintaining running form.\n\nBy Phase 3, your HIIT sessions (like the Compromised Running Circuit) have you doing a 50 m sled push at 90% race weight, then immediately running 1 km at goal pace, then rowing 500 m, then running another 1 km. Four rounds of that. The target: keep every 1 km split within 10 seconds of each other despite increasing fatigue.\n\nThis is where races are won or lost. The athlete who can run 4:45/km after the sled pull beats the athlete who runs 4:30/km fresh but blows up to 5:30/km after stations."}]}

Here's the exact breakdown:\n\n| Phase | Zone 2 (Easy) | Tempo | Intervals + Compromised |\n|-------|--------------|-------|-------------------------|\n| Phase 1 (GP) | 80% | 10% | 10% |\n| Phase 2 (SP) | 75% | 10% | 15% (includes compromised) |\n| Phase 3 (CP) | 70% | 10% | 20% (includes compromised) |\n| Phase 4 (Taper) | 75% | 0% | 25% (short, sharp work) |\n\n**Why this progression makes sense:**\n\nPhase 1 follows the classic 80/20 polarized model — 80% easy, 20% quality. This is backed by decades of endurance research showing that high-volume Zone 2 work builds the mitochondrial density and capillarization that form your aerobic foundation. With 35-38 miles per week, roughly 28-30 of those miles are easy Zone 2.\n\nPhase 2 introduces compromised running, which increases the interval/hard category to 15%. Your tempo stays the same — one dedicated threshold run per week. The new hard work comes from running immediately after station work within HIIT sessions.\n\nPhase 3 pushes the hard running to 20% as HIIT sessions now include 2-4 km of running between race-weight stations. Your threshold development shifts from generic tempo runs to race-pace specific work — 4 miles at goal Hyrox pace (4:30-4:45/km) with negative split practice.\n\nPhase 4 is counterintuitive but critical: tempo runs disappear entirely. You don't need threshold development 3 weeks from race day — that adaptation takes 6-8 weeks to manifest. Instead, 25% of your reduced volume goes to short, sharp neuromuscular work: strides at mile pace, 30-second race-pace pickups. These keep your legs fast without accumulating fatigue.\n\n**The key insight:** Easy running volume is always the majority. Even in Phase 3 when intensity peaks, 70% of your running is still Zone 2. Hyrox rewards the athlete with the biggest aerobic engine, not the one who hammers every run."}]}

Too many and you overtrain. Too few and you have no idea how station-to-station fatigue compounds. Here's the exact schedule:\n\n| Week | Simulation | Type | Volume | Intensity |\n|------|-----------|------|--------|----------|\n| 4 (Deload) | Baseline Benchmark | Partial — 4 stations + 4 km | Moderate | 85% |\n| 8 (Deload) | Half-Simulation | First half of race (Stations 1-4 + 4 km) | High | 90% |\n| 10 | Full Simulation | Complete 8-station race rehearsal | Maximum | 90-95% |\n| 12 (Deload) | Three-Quarter Sim | Second half (Stations 4-8 + 5 runs) | High | 88% |\n| 14 | Dress Rehearsal | Abbreviated half — reduced volume | Low-moderate | 70-75% |\n\n**Week 4 Baseline:** Four stations (SkiErg, Sled Push, Row, Wall Balls) with 1 km runs between each. Record every segment time. This is your measurement stick for the entire plan.\n\n**Week 8 Half-Sim:** First-half race — SkiErg through BBJ with 4 km of running. Compare run splits and station times to your Week 4 baseline. Target: less than 15 sec/km pace degradation from Run 1 to Run 4.\n\n**Week 10 Full Sim:** This is the big one. All 8 stations, all 8 km of running, 100% race weight. Target time: 68-72 minutes. Practice race-day nutrition during this — test gels, electrolytes, timing. Take a gel between BBJ and Run 5.\n\n**Week 12 Three-Quarter Sim:** Focuses on the second half (BBJ through Wall Balls) because that's where most time is lost. There's a 0.738 correlation between lunge performance and wall ball performance — athletes who go quad-dominant on lunges average 75 seconds slower on wall balls. This sim teaches you to manage that connection.\n\n**Week 14 Dress Rehearsal:** Half volume, full race weight. SkiErg 750 m, Sled Push 25 m, Wall Balls 50 reps with 1 km runs. RPE 6-7 max. If it doesn't feel easy, the taper is working.\n\nNotice sims happen on deload weeks (4, 8, 12) or during taper (14). They replace training volume rather than stacking on top of it."}]}

Phase 2 shifts to strength-endurance because Hyrox demands repetitive sub-maximal effort — 100 wall balls, 100 m lunges. You don't need a massive 1RM; you need the ability to produce moderate force repeatedly. Phase 3 preserves your Phase 1 gains without accumulating fatigue — low volume, moderate load. Phase 4 is purely neural activation: keep the pathways firing without any muscle damage.\n\nThe key insight: strength sessions decrease from 2 to 1 as HIIT sessions increase from 2 to 3. You're trading gym strength for Hyrox-specific capacity."}]}

The progression is designed to build both capacity and a race-day break strategy:\n\n**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4):** Sets of 15-25 reps, total 50-75 per session. You're learning the catch-and-squat rhythm at 6 kg to the 10 ft target. HIIT sessions like the Wall Ball Endurance Builder (EMOM 16) have you doing 15 reps per minute for a total of 162 wall balls plus air squats. RPE target: 7 by round 12.\n\n**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8):** Sets of 25, total 75-100 per session. The Grinder chipper includes 75 wall balls followed by lunges and BBJ, then another 25 wall balls. You're building toward full race volume while accumulating fatigue from other movements first.\n\n**Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12):** Full race volume — 100 reps in a single workout using the 4x25 break strategy. The Wall Ball Century workout prescribes: 25 reps, 5-sec rest (ball down, shake arms, 3 breaths), 25 reps, 5-sec rest, 25 reps, 5-sec rest, 25 reps. Target cadence: one rep every 3 seconds. Total target: 5:30-6:30 for all 100.\n\n**Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16):** 50 reps maximum per session. Race weight maintained (6 kg to 10 ft), but volume cut by 50%. Taper HIIT sessions include only 8-10 wall ball reps as neural touchpoints.\n\n**The critical coaching point on break strategy:** If any set of 25 takes longer than 100 seconds, you started too fast. The 4x25 pattern is your race-day strategy — memorize it. Most athletes who try to go unbroken end up with sets of 30-20-15-12-8-5-5-3-2 and waste 45+ seconds in total rest time compared to a disciplined 4x25.\n\nAlso critical: there's a 0.738 correlation between lunge technique and wall ball performance. If you burn out your quads with aggressive short-step lunges, your wall ball time balloons. Train them back-to-back in Phase 3 to learn that pacing."}]}

They systematically tighten from Phase 1 through Phase 3, then open back up during taper. Here's the exact progression:\n\n| Phase | Work:Rest Ratio | What This Means |\n|-------|----------------|------------------|\n| Phase 1 (GP) | 1:1 to 1:2 | Equal or more rest than work |\n| Phase 2 (SP) | 1:0.75 to 1:1 | Rest starts shrinking |\n| Phase 3 (CP) | 1:0.5 to 1:1 | Half as much rest as work |\n| Phase 4 (Taper) | 1:1 to 1:2 | Back to generous rest |\n\n**Why this progression matters:** In Phase 1, generous rest (1:2) lets you maintain quality on each work interval. You're learning movements and building aerobic capacity — quality matters more than density. A Phase 1 workout like the Erg Pacing Builder (EMOM 20) gives you roughly 18-20 seconds of rest per minute, which is close to 1:2.\n\nPhase 2 tightens to 1:0.75-1:1. The Sled Power Endurance workout (Every 3:00 x 8 sets) targets 90-120 sec of work with 60-90 sec rest — roughly 1:0.75. Your body is adapting to incomplete recovery between efforts.\n\nPhase 3 goes to 1:0.5 — you're working twice as long as you're resting. This simulates race conditions where transitions between stations and runs happen immediately with zero planned rest. The 4-Station Hyrox Block is done for time with zero rest between segments.\n\nPhase 4 opens the ratios back to 1:1 or 1:2. The Taper Sharpener EMOM gives you ample rest within each minute. The Race Primer EMOM is RPE 5-6 with 20+ seconds of rest per minute. You're touching race-weight movements without metabolic stress.\n\n**The parallel with time domains:** Sessions also get longer — 10-20 min pieces in Phase 1, 15-25 min in Phase 2, 20-40 min in Phase 3, back to 10-15 min in Phase 4.

They both have 3 sessions per week."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You're right that both phases have 3 HIIT sessions per week, but the content is dramatically different. Let me break down the key distinctions:\n\n**Phase 2 HIIT:**\n- Average session duration: 45-55 minutes\n- Time domains: 15-25 minute pieces\n- Station loads: 90% race weight\n- Movements per session: 3-6 stations\n- Compromised running: 1 per session (beginning to introduce it)\n- Work:rest ratio: 1:0.75 to 1:1\n- Example: Sled Power Endurance — Every 3:00 x 8 sets of alternating sled push/pull at 137 kg (90% race weight). Focus on building capacity at near-race loads.\n\n**Phase 3 HIIT:**\n- Average session duration: 50-65 minutes\n- Time domains: 20-40 minute pieces\n- Station loads: **100% race weight**\n- Movements per session: 4-8 stations (up to full race sequence)\n- Compromised running: 2-4 km per session (multiple run segments between stations)\n- Work:rest ratio: 1:0.5 to 1:1\n- Example: 4-Station Hyrox Block — For time, Run 1 km → Row 1,000 m → Run 1 km → Farmers Carry 200 m → Run 1 km → Sandbag Lunges 100 m → Run 1 km → Wall Balls 100 reps. No rest. Target time: 38-45 minutes.\n\n**The three biggest differences:**\n\n1. **Load jumps to 100%:** Phase 2 trains at 90% race weight. Phase 3 uses full race specifications on everything — 152 kg sled push, 103 kg sled pull, full 200 m farmers carry, full 100 m lunges, full 100 wall ball reps.\n\n2. **Compromised running volume explodes:** Phase 2 introduces it gently. Phase 3 sessions include 2-4 km of running sandwiched between race-weight stations. You're simulating the actual race experience.\n\n3. **Session complexity peaks:** Phase 2 hits 3-6 stations per session. Phase 3 goes up to 8 — the full race sequence. This is where your brain and body learn to manage fatigue across a 60+ minute effort with constantly changing movement patterns.\n\nThink of Phase 2 as building the parts. Phase 3 is assembling the whole machine and testing it under race conditions."}]}

If you're drifting below 8:00/mi on easy days, you're stealing recovery from your hard sessions.\n\n**Goal Race Pace Progression:**\n| Phase | Target Race Pace |\n|-------|------------------|\n| Phase 1 | 7:15-7:30/mi (4:30-4:40/km) |\n| Phase 2 | 7:05-7:20/mi (4:25-4:35/km) |\n| Phase 3 | 7:00-7:15/mi (4:20-4:30/km) |\n| Phase 4 | Maintain Phase 3 pace |\n\n**Tempo/Threshold Runs:**\n- Phase 1: 3 miles at half-marathon pace within a 7-mile total session\n- Phase 2: Shifts to Norwegian 4x4 intervals — 4 x 4 min at 90% HRmax with 3 min jog recovery, totaling ~8 miles\n- Phase 3: 4 miles at goal Hyrox run pace (4:30-4:45/km) with negative split practice — last mile 10 sec/km faster\n- Phase 4: No tempo runs. Replaced by strides and short race-pace pickups.\n\n**VO2max Intervals:**\n- Phase 1-2: 4 x 4 min at 85-95% HRmax, 3 min active recovery\n- Phase 3: 5 x 4 min or 6 x 3 min at 90% HRmax\n- Phase 4: 3 x 4 min (reduced volume), then eliminated by Week 15\n\n**Long Run:**\n- Phase 1: 10 miles easy at 8:00-8:30/mi\n- Phase 2: 11 miles with last 2 miles at tempo\n- Phase 3: 10 miles easy\n- Phase 4: 8 → 6 → 0 miles (eliminated by Week 15)\n\n**Why the race pace target improves:** Your Phase 1 aerobic base work creates the foundation. By Phase 2, with 5+ weeks of Zone 2 development and interval work, your lactate threshold shifts rightward — you can hold a faster pace at the same perceived effort. Phase 3 is where you lock in the race pace you'll actually execute on race day. Phase 4 doesn't try to improve it further — you're just maintaining the gains.\n\n**Race-day pacing targets for your arm:** Run 1: 4:40/km (conservative start) → Runs 2-4: 4:35-4:45 → Runs 5-7: 4:50 → Run 8: 4:55 (allow drift on the final km)."}]}

Where does the extra time come from?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Phase 2 adds a 3rd HIIT session because this is when your training becomes Hyrox-specific, and you need the additional station practice volume. The time comes from restructuring, not from adding a 7th training day. Here's how it works:\n\n**Phase 1 structure (6 training days):**\n- 5 runs + 2 strength + 2 HIIT = some sessions double up (AM run + PM HIIT)\n\n**Phase 2 structure (still 6 training days):**\n- 5 runs + 2 strength + 3 HIIT = more doubling up\n\nThe 3rd HIIT session gets added to Saturday. In Phase 1, Saturday is Long Run (AM) + optional Strength (PM). In Phase 2, Saturday becomes Long Run (AM) + HIIT (PM). That upper body strength session that was optional on Saturday gets absorbed into the existing 2 strength sessions or reduced.\n\n**The weekly template shifts like this:**\n\nPhase 1 Saturday: 10 mi long run (AM) + Bench Press 4x6, Rows 4x8, Strict Press 3x8, Pull-ups (PM)\n\nPhase 2 Saturday: 11 mi long run with last 2 mi at tempo (AM) + HIIT #10 Compromised Running Circuit (PM)\n\n**Why this trade is worth it:** By Phase 2, you've spent 4 weeks building maximal strength. Your squat, deadlift, and press numbers are as high as they need to be for Hyrox. Continuing to push upper body volume on Saturday doesn't serve the race. But adding a Compromised Running Circuit — where you do sled pushes, rows, and 1 km runs in sequence — directly develops the race-specific capacity you need.\n\nThe research on concurrent training supports this: after the initial strength base is built (4-6 weeks), further gains in maximal strength have diminishing returns for endurance sport performance. What matters now is converting that strength into strength-endurance at Hyrox-specific loads. Three HIIT sessions per week gives you enough practice volume across all 8 station types to build genuine competence by Week 8.\n\nThe 3rd HIIT session stays through Phase 3, then drops back to 2 in early taper and 1 in late taper. It's in the plan for exactly 8 weeks (Weeks 5-12) — long enough to create meaningful adaptation, not so long that it causes burnout."}]}

Odd minutes: 15 cal SkiErg. Even minutes: 15 cal Row. Complete in ~40-42 sec each round, rest the remainder. RPE 6-7. The focus is pacing discipline — your goal is identical splits each round (plus or minus 1 second). If you finish with less than 12 sec rest, drop to 12 cal.\n\n**Phase 2 example — SkiErg + Sled Pull EMOM (HIIT #9):** EMOM 20. Min 1: 18 cal SkiErg. Min 2: 1 x 12.5 m sled pull at 90% race weight. Min 3: 18 cal SkiErg. Min 4: Active rest. Repeat 5 rounds. SkiErg split target: 1:50-2:00/500 m.\n\n**Phase 3 example — Race Pace Station Intervals (HIIT #12):** Every 4:00 x 8 sets. Set 1: SkiErg 500 m at race pace (target ~1:55). Set 5: Row 500 m at race pace. Full race weight on all other stations between erg sets.\n\n**Why this matters:** The ergs are the two stations where pacing discipline is most critical. A 5-second per 500 m deviation on the SkiErg or rower costs you 10 seconds per station — and if you go too hard early, you pay for it on the run that follows. Phase 1's pacing focus teaches you to hold consistent splits before you ever touch race distance."}]}

Race Primer EMOM includes just 8 m of BBJ as a neural touchpoint.\n\n**Sandbag Lunges (race distance: 100 m at 20 kg):**\n- Phase 1: 25-50 m per session at 20 kg. Station Introduction Circuit: 25 m per round x 4 rounds. Step length: 0.9-1.0 m, touch-and-go.\n- Phase 2: 50-75 m per session. The Farmers Carry + Lunges Superset (HIIT #7): 25 m lunges paired with 100 m farmers carry, 4 rounds every 5:00. The Grinder: 75 m continuous.\n- Phase 3: 100 m — full race distance. The 4-Station Hyrox Block (HIIT #14) includes 100 m lunges at 20 kg followed immediately by 1 km run then 100 wall balls. This is the crucial lunge-to-wall-ball connection.\n- Phase 4: 50 m (maintenance). Taper Sharpener EMOM: 15 m per set.\n\n**Critical coaching point on lunges:** Stride length should be 0.9-1.0 m throughout all phases. That's roughly 100-111 total steps for the full 100 m. Shorter steps (0.7 m = ~140 steps) are quad-dominant and will destroy your legs before wall balls. Longer steps (>1.2 m) create balance issues on fatigued legs. Lock in that 0.9-1.0 m stride in Phase 1 and never deviate.\n\n**The lunge-wall ball connection:** HyroxDataLab found a correlation of r = 0.738 between lunge technique and wall ball performance. Athletes who went quad-dominant on lunges averaged 75 seconds slower on wall balls. This is why Phase 3 sessions always pair lunges immediately before wall balls — you're training the exact race sequence."}]}

Can I handle that with my current fitness?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"With 35-40 miles per week and 4-5 strength days, you're already doing more total training volume than this plan asks for in Week 1. The difference is the structure, not the load.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n**Current training:** ~9-10 sessions per week (5 runs + 4-5 lifts)\n**Week 1 of this plan:** ~9 sessions per week (5 runs + 2 lifts + 2 HIIT)\n\nYou're actually doing fewer total sessions. We're converting 2-3 of your strength days into HIIT sessions that include Hyrox station work. The doubles (AM run + PM HIIT on Monday, AM long run + PM strength on Saturday) are structured so the AM session is aerobic and the PM session uses different energy systems and movement patterns.\n\nMonday AM is Zone 2 running (aerobic, lower body). Monday PM is erg intervals (aerobic-anaerobic, upper body dominant). Saturday AM is easy long run (aerobic). Saturday PM is upper body strength (neuromuscular, minimal aerobic demand). These don't compete for the same recovery resources.\n\n**The key adjustment from your current training:** You're dropping from 4-5 pure strength sessions to 2. That's the trade. Those extra 2-3 days become HIIT sessions with Hyrox-specific movements. You'll still get strong — the squat and deadlift progressions are built in — but you're shifting the emphasis from gym strength to functional capacity.\n\nIf you feel crushed after the first week, the fix isn't removing a session — it's reducing the intensity of easy runs. Most people run their easy days too fast. Keep those 8:00-8:30/mi runs genuinely easy and you'll recover fine between sessions."}]}

Let me put it in context — you covered 4 km of running plus SkiErg, Sled Push, Row, and Wall Balls. If we extrapolate to a full 8-station race (which isn't linear, but gives a rough estimate), you're tracking toward a ~78-82 minute finish. That's well within the range we can bring to 68-72 minutes by race day.\n\nBefore I tell you what to focus on, I need to know your segment splits. What were your individual times for:\n1. Each 1 km run\n2. SkiErg 1,000 m\n3. Sled Push 50 m at 152 kg\n4. Row 1,000 m\n5. Wall Balls 100 reps\n\nThe total time matters less than where the time is going.

Let me analyze each segment against our targets:\n\n**Runs:** 4:35 → 4:40 → 4:50 → 5:10. That's a 35-second degradation from Run 1 to Run 4. We want less than 15 seconds of drift. Your first two runs are great — right at goal pace. But after the sled push you lost 10 seconds, and after the row you lost another 20. This tells me your compromised running needs significant work in Phase 2.\n\n**SkiErg (3:55):** Target is 3:50. You're 5 seconds off — essentially on pace. This is fine.\n\n**Sled Push (3:20):** Target is 2:50. You're 30 seconds over. This is your biggest limiter right now. At 80% race weight in Phase 1, your sled push should be faster than this at 100% weight. Two possibilities: technique issue (body angle not at 45°, steps too long) or pure pushing power.\n\n**Row (3:52):** Target is 3:50. Essentially on target. Strong.\n\n**Wall Balls (6:45):** Target is 5:30. You're 75 seconds over. This is your second biggest limiter. At 100 reps with a 4x25 break strategy, you should be holding 25 reps in about 75-80 seconds. Were you breaking into smaller sets? What was your break pattern?\n\n**Phase 2 priorities based on this data:**\n1. **Sled push technique and power** — we're increasing to 90% race weight (137 kg) but focusing on proper 45° body angle, short explosive steps, never letting the sled stop\n2. **Wall ball break strategy** — lock in the 4x25 pattern with 5-sec rests, practice cadence of 1 rep every 3 seconds\n3. **Compromised running** — your 35-sec drift tells me your body doesn't know how to run after heavy station work. Phase 2 adds weekly compromised running sessions where you run 2.5 miles immediately after strength work.\n\nYour SkiErg and row are dialed. We maintain those and attack the weak links."}]}

I feel like I'm not recovering well. Should I drop back?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Don't drop back yet — let's diagnose first. A few questions:\n\n1. What's your sleep looking like? Hours per night and quality?\n2. Are you actually running your easy days easy (8:00-8:30/mi) or creeping below 8:00?\n3. How's your nutrition — are you fueling enough for 6 training days per week?\n4. Is it full-body fatigue, or specific muscle groups (quads, shoulders, grip)?\n\nThe jump from 2 to 3 HIIT sessions in Phase 2 is the biggest structural change in the entire plan. It's normal to feel it for the first 1-2 weeks as your body adapts. Week 5 was the first week at this volume, and Week 6 is where the accumulated fatigue often peaks before adaptation kicks in.\n\nThat said, there's a difference between \"this is hard and I'm tired\" and \"my performance is declining and I'm not recovering between sessions.\" Which one is it?"},{"role":"user","content":"I think my easy runs have been too fast — around 7:30-7:40. And I've been sleeping about 6.5 hours. It's more general fatigue, not one muscle group."},{"role":"assistant","content":"There it is. Two clear problems, and neither requires dropping a session:\n\n**Problem 1: Easy pace is way too fast.**\n7:30-7:40/mi is your tempo zone, not your easy zone. You're essentially running a moderate workout 3 times a week instead of recovering. At your fitness level, easy should be 8:00-8:30/mi — that might feel embarrassingly slow, but that's the point. Zone 2 running at proper easy pace uses primarily fat oxidation and builds mitochondrial density without accumulating significant fatigue. Running at 7:30 shifts you into Zone 3 — too hard to recover from, too easy to create meaningful threshold adaptation. It's junk mileage.\n\n**Fix:** Slow down immediately to 8:00-8:30/mi on Monday AM, Friday, and Saturday AM runs. Use heart rate if you don't trust pace — Zone 2 should keep you below 145-150 bpm (roughly). You should be able to hold a full conversation.\n\n**Problem 2: 6.5 hours of sleep is insufficient.**\nYou're training 6 days per week with AM/PM doubles. You need 7.5-8+ hours minimum. Jake Dearden — the Hyrox world champion — uses HRV and sleep quality data to dictate daily training load. When his numbers are down, the intensity drops. Sleep is where adaptation happens — growth hormone peaks during deep sleep, muscle protein synthesis requires it, and your nervous system needs it to recover from high-intensity HIIT work.\n\n**Fix:** Add 30-60 minutes to your sleep window this week. Non-negotiable.\n\n**The protocol:** Make these two changes for the next 7 days. If by Week 7 you still feel crushed, we drop the Saturday PM HIIT session and keep it to 2 HIIT sessions that week as a mini-deload. But I bet slowing down your easy runs alone will feel like a different training plan. Give it a week."}]}

Walk me through what changes from last phase and why."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Phase 3 (Competition Prep, Weeks 9-12) is where everything gets real. Here are the five biggest shifts from Phase 2:\n\n**1. Station loads go to 100% race weight.**\nSled push: 137 kg → 152 kg. Sled pull: 93 kg → 103 kg. Wall balls stay at 6 kg but you're now doing full 100-rep sets. BBJ goes to full 80 m. Lunges to full 100 m. Farmers carry to 200 m. Ergs to 1,000 m. Everything matches race day.\n\nWhy: You need 8 weeks of practice at race weight before race day. Phase 3 gives you Weeks 9-12, plus the lighter touchpoints in Phase 4. That's enough neuromuscular familiarity to execute confidently.\n\n**2. Strength drops from 2 sessions to 1-2.**\nWeek 10 has only 1 strength session. The protocol shifts to maintenance: Back Squat 3x4 at 82%, Deadlift 3x3 at 85%, rest 3 minutes. No progression — just preservation.\n\nWhy: The strength gains from Phase 1 are in the bank. Continuing to push strength volume now competes with HIIT recovery. One maintenance session preserves your neural pathways without accumulating fatigue.\n\n**3. HIIT complexity peaks.**\nSessions go from 45-55 min to 50-65 min. Time domains expand to 20-40 minute pieces. Work:rest tightens to 1:0.5. Sessions include 4-8 stations (up to the full race sequence). The 4-Station Hyrox Block is a for-time workout with 4 km of running, rowing, farmers carry, lunges, and 100 wall balls — a 38-45 minute effort.\n\nWhy: Your body needs to learn sustained output across 60+ minutes with constantly changing movement patterns and minimal rest. This is race simulation training.\n\n**4. You do your highest-volume simulation in Week 10.**\nFull 8-station simulation. All 8 km of running. All 8 stations at race weight. Target: 68-72 minutes. This is your dress rehearsal.\n\n**5. Compromised running volume doubles.**\nPhase 2 had 1 compromised run per session. Phase 3 has 2-4 km of running embedded in each HIIT session. You're running between every station, just like race day.\n\nThe overall weekly structure stays at 6 training days with 3 HIIT sessions, but the content within those sessions is dramatically more demanding."},{"role":"user","content":"That sounds intense. How do I know if I'm handling the jump to 100% race weight OK?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Three objective markers tell you if you're adapting well:\n\n**1. Station times at race weight should be within 15-20% of your fresh benchmarks.**\nIn Week 1, you tested individual stations fresh. If your fresh sled push at 152 kg was 2:30, your sled push within a Phase 3 HIIT session (fatigued) should be under 3:00. If it's over 3:15, the race weight is exceeding your current capacity and we need to modify.\n\n**2. Run splits within HIIT sessions should stay within 15 sec/km of target.**\nIn the 4-Station Block Simulation, your 4 run splits should range from 4:35 to 4:55/km. If your 4th km is blowing up past 5:15, it means the station loads are creating too much fatigue for your current aerobic capacity to clear.\n\n**3. Compare your Week 10 Full Sim to your Week 8 Half-Sim.**\nThe first 4 stations + 4 km in your Full Sim should be within 2-3 minutes of your Week 8 Half-Sim total time. If they're 5+ minutes slower, you're either under-recovered or the race-weight jump was too aggressive.\n\n**Red flags that mean we need to adjust:**\n- RPE consistently above 9 on HIIT sessions that are prescribed at RPE 8\n- Resting heart rate elevated 5+ bpm above baseline for 3+ consecutive days\n- Run pace on easy days drifting above 9:00/mi (your body is telling you it needs more recovery)\n- Grip failure on farmers carry or sled pull before completing prescribed distance\n- Wall ball breaks increasing (e.g., going from 4x25 to sets of 15 or 10)\n\n**If you see these signs:** First, ensure sleep is 8+ hours and nutrition is adequate. Second, reduce the volume within HIIT sessions by 20% (cut 1 round or reduce distances) while keeping the race weight. The load stays, the volume adjusts. We never go backward on weight in Phase 3 — that defeats the purpose."}]}

The taper is what lets you express it.\n\nHere's the evidence: the taper protocol follows the research-backed model of reducing volume 40-60% while maintaining or slightly increasing intensity on key sessions. This does three things:\n\n1. **Full glycogen resynthesis** — your muscles fully restock their fuel stores, which takes 48-72 hours of reduced training\n2. **Muscle repair** — the micro-damage from 12 weeks of training fully heals, converting inflammation into adaptation\n3. **Psychological freshness** — you arrive on race day hungry to compete, not relieved it's over\n\nIf you extend Phase 3 by even one week, you're entering race day with accumulated fatigue that costs you 3-5 minutes. The fitness gains from one extra week of training are negligible compared to arriving fresh.\n\n**I'm not going to let you skip the taper. Here's what we're doing:**\n\nWeek 13: Running drops to 32 miles (from 36-38). One strength session. Two HIIT sessions at reduced volume. Five training days instead of six.\n\nWeek 14: 30 miles.

Three rounds. RPE 6-7. Should feel \"comfortable-hard\" — practiced, controlled, smooth.\n\nWeek 13 Thursday also has **Race-Pace Express** (HIIT #19): For time — Run 1 km at race pace, Sled Push 25 m at 152 kg (half distance), Run 1 km at race pace, Wall Balls 50 reps. Total: 16-20 minutes. RPE 7. This confirms your race-day pacing targets.\n\nWeek 14 Thursday is the **Dress Rehearsal** simulation: Run 1 km, SkiErg 750 m, Run 1 km, Sled Push 25 m at 152 kg, Run 1 km, Wall Balls 50 reps, Run 1 km. Half volume, full weight. RPE 6-7 max.\n\nWeek 15 gets just one HIIT: **Race Primer EMOM** (HIIT #20): 10 minutes. SkiErg 10 cal, Wall Balls 8 reps, Row 10 cal, Farmers Carry 30 m, BBJ 8 m, Lunges 10 m, then repeat partially. RPE 5-6. This is NOT a training stimulus — it's a neural primer.

The goal isn't to run fast; it's to run with acceptable biomechanics while your legs are full of metabolic byproducts from the squats and lunges.\n\n**What you're training:** In Hyrox, every 1 km run follows a station. After sled pushes, your quads are destroyed. After lunges, your hip flexors are tight. After wall balls, everything hurts. Your body needs to learn how to flush lactate, restore running mechanics, and settle into a sustainable pace within the first 200-400 meters of each run.\n\nThis 2.5-mile compromised run simulates Runs 3-4 of the race (post-sled, post-BBJ). By the time we get to Phase 3, your HIIT sessions will have 2-4 km of running between race-weight stations — a much more specific simulation. But for now, this is the entry point."},{"role":"user","content":"Should I expect my pace to be slower for the whole 2.5 miles, or does it normalize?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"It normalizes — and tracking that normalization is actually one of your progress markers. Here's what you'll typically see:\n\n**First 800 m (0.5 mi):** Pace is 30-45 seconds slower than your normal easy pace. So instead of 8:15/mi, you might be running 8:45-9:00. Your legs feel heavy, your breathing is elevated from the strength work, and your stride is shorter. This is normal.\n\n**800 m to 1.6 km (0.5-1.0 mi):** Pace starts returning to normal. Lactate is clearing, your breathing settles, and your stride lengthens. You might be at 8:20-8:30/mi by the end of this segment.\n\n**Last 1.5 miles:** Should feel like a normal easy run. 8:00-8:30/mi. If it still feels compromised after 1.5 miles, the strength session was too heavy or you're under-recovered.\n\n**What to track over weeks:** The time it takes to normalize. In Week 5, it might take a full mile to get back to normal pace. By Week 8, it should take 400-600 meters. By Phase 3, when compromised running is embedded in HIIT sessions with shorter run segments, your body should normalize within 200-300 meters of each 1 km run.\n\nThis is a trainable adaptation. Your body gets more efficient at clearing lactate, stabilizing heart rate, and restoring running biomechanics after heavy work. The research shows that compromised running ability is the single most trainable limiter in Hyrox performance — athletes who practice it regularly can maintain within 10 seconds per km of their fresh pace even deep into a race simulation.\n\n**Don't chase pace on these runs.** The temptation is to force yourself back to normal speed immediately. Resist it. Let your body find its own recovery rhythm. The pace normalization will get faster naturally as the weeks progress."}]}

Target duration is 68-72 minutes, so plan for a 70-80 minute effort. Here's what I recommend:\n\n**Pre-Sim (2-3 hours before):**\n- Meal with 80-100g carbs, moderate protein, low fat and fiber. Example: oatmeal with banana and honey, or toast with jam and a small protein shake.\n- 500 ml water with electrolytes in the hour before\n\n**During Sim — one gel at a specific point:**\n- Take a gel (25-30g fast carbs) between Station 4 (BBJ) and Run 5\n- That's roughly the 35-40 minute mark\n- Chase it with a few sips of water if available\n\n**Why this timing:** You have 8 Roxzone transitions in the race. The transition between BBJ and Run 5 is the midpoint. Your glycogen stores start declining significantly after 45-60 minutes of sustained mixed-modal work. Taking the gel at the midpoint tops off glucose availability for the brutal back half — Row, Farmers Carry, Lunges, Wall Balls.\n\n**What to test specifically:**\n1. Does the gel brand/type sit well in your stomach while running?\n2. Can you open and consume it quickly during a Roxzone transition (target: under 15 seconds)?\n3. Does it cause any GI distress in the 10-15 minutes after taking it?\n\nIf you have GI issues, try a different brand or switch to liquid carbs (sip of sports drink) for race day.

Here's why:\n\n**For the Week 10 sim:** Eat normally in the days leading up. You want the simulation to reflect your current fitness, not an artificially enhanced glycogen state. If you carb-load before the sim, your time will be artificially better and you won't have an honest benchmark.\n\n**For race week (Week 16), here's the carb-loading protocol:**\n\nStart 2-3 days before race day (Wednesday-Thursday for a Friday race):\n- Increase carb intake to 8-10 g per kg of bodyweight per day\n- For an 80 kg athlete, that's 640-800 g of carbs per day\n- Sources: rice, pasta, bread, potatoes, oats, fruit, sports drinks\n- Reduce fat and fiber to make room (they're satiating but don't fuel glycogen)\n- Maintain normal protein intake (1.7-2.2 g/kg)\n\n**Day before race (Thursday):**\n- Front-load carbs earlier in the day\n- Dinner should be familiar, high-carb, moderate-protein, low-fat\n- Stop eating at least 2 hours before bed\n- Hydrate well — 500 ml water with electrolytes before bed\n\n**Race morning (3 hours before start):**\n- 80-100 g carbs from familiar, easily digestible sources\n- Small amount of protein (15-20 g)\n- Minimal fat and fiber\n- 500 ml water with electrolytes\n- Nothing new on race day — only foods you've tested\n\nThe only thing to test during the Week 10 sim is the mid-race gel and your pre-workout meal timing.

Aren't they the same thing?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Similar but different in purpose and execution. Let me clarify:\n\n**Simulation #2 (Week 8, Deload) — Half-Simulation:**\nThis is a TEST, not a training session. It's your first-half race rehearsal done during a deload week when you're relatively fresh.\n- Format: Run 1 km → SkiErg 1,000 m → Run 1 km → Sled Push 50 m at 152 kg → Run 1 km → Sled Pull 50 m at 103 kg → Run 1 km → BBJ 80 m\n- Intensity: 90%. Pace as close to race day as possible.\n- Purpose: Benchmark. Compare your station times to Week 4 baseline. Measure pace degradation from Run 1 to Run 4 (target: less than 15 sec/km drift).\n- It replaces a regular training session — no other HIIT that day.\n\n**Phase 3 Block Simulations (HIIT #14 and #16) — Training Sessions:**\nThese are TRAINING workouts done during regular training weeks when you're carrying fatigue.\n\nHIIT #14 (4-Station Hyrox Block): Run 1 km → Row 1,000 m → Run 1 km → Farmers 200 m → Run 1 km → Lunges 100 m → Run 1 km → Wall Balls 100 reps. This covers Stations 5-8.\n\nHIIT #16 (Stations 1-4 Block): Run 1 km → SkiErg 1,000 m → Run 1 km → Sled Push 50 m → Run 1 km → Sled Pull 50 m → Run 1 km → BBJ 80 m. This covers Stations 1-4.\n\n**The key differences:**\n1. Block sims happen on a regular training day, not a deload. You're fatigued.\n2. They cover different halves of the race on different days — you never do all 8 stations as a training workout (that's reserved for the Week 10 Full Sim).\n3. The training block sims are about developing race capacity. The deload sim is about measuring it.\n\nThink of it this way: block sims build the engine. Deload sims measure how big the engine has gotten."},{"role":"user","content":"Got it. So should I go all out on the training block sims?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No — RPE 8, not all-out. There's a crucial distinction:\n\n**Block sim training sessions: RPE 8 (hard but controlled)**\n- You should finish feeling like you had 10-15% more in the tank\n- Run splits should be at goal race pace, not faster\n- Station execution should be smooth and technical, not frantic\n- These happen on Thursday of your training week — you still have Saturday HIIT and training the following week\n\n**Full simulations (Weeks 10, 12): RPE 90-95%**\n- These are near-race effort on pre-planned test days\n- You push harder because the training plan accounts for recovery afterward\n\n**Dress rehearsal (Week 14): RPE 6-7**\n- Should feel easy. If it doesn't, the taper is working.\n\nThe reason you don't go all-out on training block sims is recovery. These sessions create massive fatigue — 4 km of running plus 4 race-weight stations in a single session. If you redline them, your Friday easy run becomes a slog, your Saturday HIIT quality drops, and you're still carrying fatigue into the following Monday. That cascading effect compounds over weeks.\n\nControlled effort at RPE 8 creates the training stimulus without the recovery debt. You're practicing race execution, not testing race limits. Save that for the deload simulations where you have recovery days on either side."}]}

It seems like an odd test after the full sim in Week 10."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Great observation. The Week 12 Three-Quarter Sim exists for a very specific reason: the second half of the race is where most time is lost.\n\nYour Week 10 Full Sim gave you data on all 16 segments. But look at where the time typically bleeds — it's Stations 5-8 (Row, Farmers, Lunges, Wall Balls) and Runs 5-8. By testing the second half specifically, we isolate that part of the race.\n\n**The Three-Quarter Sim covers:**\nRun → BBJ 80 m → Run → Row 1,000 m → Run → Farmers 200 m → Run → Sandbag Lunges 100 m → Run → Wall Balls 100 reps\n\nThat's 5 runs and 5 stations — the back half of the race from Station 4 onward.\n\n**Why this matters more than another full sim:**\n\n1. The lunge-to-wall-ball connection has a 0.738 correlation coefficient (per HyroxDataLab). Athletes who mismanage lunges — going too short on steps, going quad-dominant — lose an average of 75 seconds on wall balls. This sim lets you practice that exact transition.\n\n2. You already have full-sim data from Week 10. Another full sim 2 weeks later would be redundant AND overly fatiguing during a deload week.\n\n3. Runs 5-8 are where compromised running falls apart. By starting the sim at Station 4, you're fresh enough that the first run is controlled — but by Run 5 (the last one), you're experiencing the same cumulative fatigue as the end of a full race."},{"role":"user","content":"Should I compare my split times from this sim to the corresponding splits from the Week 10 full sim?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Absolutely — but with an important caveat. You need to compare them in the right context.\n\n**Direct comparison (Week 10 Full Sim vs Week 12 3/4 Sim):**\n\nIn the Week 10 sim, by the time you reached Station 5 (Row), you'd already done 5 km of running, SkiErg, Sled Push, Sled Pull, and BBJ. You were deeply fatigued.\n\nIn the Week 12 sim, you start at BBJ. By the time you reach the Row, you've only done 2 km of running and 1 station. You're much fresher.\n\n**So expect these things:**\n- Your Station 5-8 times in Week 12 should be 5-15% faster than Week 10 because you're less pre-fatigued\n- Your Run splits in Week 12 should be more consistent because cumulative fatigue is lower\n- Your wall ball time should be significantly better because your legs aren't carrying 7 stations of fatigue\n\n**What to actually look for:**\n1. **Run degradation within this sim.** From your first run to your last run in the 3/4 sim, how much do you drift? Target: less than 10 sec/km from first to last.\n2. **Lunge time.** Compare to your Week 10 lunge time. Even though you're fresher, your technique should be more dialed — stride length should be a consistent 0.9-1.0 m.\n3. **Wall ball time and break pattern.** This is the key metric. You should see meaningful improvement from Week 10 because (a) your lunges should be more efficient, saving your quads, and (b) you've had 2 more weeks of wall ball practice.\n\n**Target improvements over Week 10:**\n- Wall balls: 30-60 seconds faster\n- Lunges: 10-20 seconds faster\n- Run consistency: half the drift\n\nIf you see these improvements, you're on track. The 4 weeks of taper ahead will add another 3-5% improvement from freshness alone."}]}

How do I modify the training plan?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No sled is a real problem — sled push and sled pull are two of the eight stations, and they're the most uniquely demanding movements in Hyrox. But we can work around it with targeted substitutions. Here's what I'd do:\n\n**Sled Push substitution — Heavy Prowler Alternatives:**\n- Option A: Heavy leg press (if your gym has one) — load it to race weight equivalent and do 4 sets of 20 reps with short steps/pulses at the top. This mimics the quad-dominant pushing pattern.\n- Option B: Heavy wall sits (45 sec holds) supersetted with 10 explosive broad jumps — replicates the isometric quad demand + horizontal force production\n- Option C: Heavy weighted sled push on turf if available, or heavy resistance band-resisted walking lunges for 50 m\n\n**Sled Pull substitution — Rope and Pulling Alternatives:**\n- Option A: Heavy seated cable row — 4x12 with explosive pulls and controlled return, heavy weight\n- Option B: Battle rope pulls — attach a heavy rope to a fixed anchor, sit on the ground with legs extended, and hand-over-hand pull yourself toward it\n- Option C: Heavy face pulls or band pull-aparts supersetted with 250 m rows at race pace\n\n**However — and this is non-negotiable:** You MUST get sled time before race day. Find a gym with a sled at least once per week during Phase 2, and twice per week during Phase 3. The neuromuscular pattern of pushing and pulling a loaded sled cannot be replicated by any substitute. The body angle, the foot contact, the full-body bracing — you need the real thing.\n\nSearch for CrossFit boxes, Hyrox training centers, or outdoor training facilities in your area. Many offer day passes or punch cards. Budget for 8-12 sled sessions across Phases 2-3 and you'll be fine."},{"role":"user","content":"There's a CrossFit box 20 minutes away. What if I go there just for sled sessions?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"That's the move. Here's exactly how to structure it:\n\n**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): No sled needed.**\nUse the substitutions at your regular gym. Sled loads in Phase 1 are only 80% race weight, and the focus is movement introduction. The substitutions will build the relevant strength.\n\n**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): 1 sled session per week at the CrossFit box.**\nSchedule it on Thursday (your HIIT day). Do the sled-specific HIIT workouts there:\n- Week 5-7: Sled Power Endurance — Every 3:00 x 8 sets, alternating sled push (137 kg) and sled pull (93 kg) for 50 m each. 24 minutes.\n- Week 8: Half-Simulation includes sled push and sled pull at full race weight.\n\n**Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12): 2 sled sessions per week.**\nAdd Monday PM in addition to Thursday. Phase 3 sessions at the box:\n- Race Pace Station Intervals (HIIT #12): 8 sets including sled push at 152 kg and sled pull at 103 kg\n- Block simulations (HIIT #14 or #16) that include sled work\n- Week 10 Full Sim and Week 12 Three-Quarter Sim both require sleds\n\n**Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16): 1 session per week, then none.**\n- Weeks 13-14: One race-weight sled touchpoint (half distance — 25 m push, 25 m pull)\n- Weeks 15-16: No sled needed. Neural patterns are established.\n\n**Total CrossFit box visits: roughly 15-18 sessions** across 12 weeks. If they offer a punch card or monthly pass, that's your best value.\n\n**Pro tip:** Before your first visit, email the box and ask what their sled weighs unloaded. Standard HYROX race sleds are about 52 kg. CrossFit sleds vary from 30-75 kg. You need to load to 152 kg total for race weight — do the math based on their sled's base weight."}]}

In Week 5 specifically, I'd do 6 sets instead of 8. Get used to the heavier load before adding full volume in Week 6.\n\n2. **Tuesday compromised run:** Keep it at 2 miles instead of 2.5 for Week 5. The front squat is a new movement pattern for your Tuesday strength session — your legs will be more fatigued than expected.\n\n3. **Saturday PM HIIT:** The Compromised Running Circuit calls for 4 rounds. Do 3 rounds in Week 5. The long run in the morning already has the new tempo finish — two new stimuli on the same day is enough.\n\n4. **Thursday HIIT:** Run as prescribed. This session (BBJ + Wall Ball + Lunge chipper) replaces the Phase 1 station introduction circuit. The movements are familiar; only the volume and intensity increase.\n\n**Week 5 → 6 → 7 progression:**\n- Week 5: Reduced sets/rounds on new sessions (80% of prescribed volume)\n- Week 6: Full prescription on everything\n- Week 7: Full prescription, push for slightly faster times or heavier loads where indicated\n- Week 8: Deload — volume drops 30-40%, Half-Sim on Saturday\n\n**Recovery priorities during the transition:**\n- Sleep: 7.5-8 hours minimum. Non-negotiable.\n- Easy run pace: Strictly 8:00-8:30/mi. No ego.\n- Nutrition: You're burning more calories with the 3rd HIIT session. Increase carb intake by 200-300 calories on HIIT days.\n- Sunday rest: True rest. Walk and foam roll only.\n\nThe body adapts faster than you think. By Week 6, the 3-HIIT structure will feel like your new normal."}]}

How do I mentally handle the volume drop?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Every athlete feels this way during the taper. It's so universal that sports psychologists have a name for it — \"taper madness.\" Here's the science and the strategy:\n\n**The physiological reality:** Fitness adaptations take 10-21 days to fully manifest after the training stimulus that created them. The hard work you did in Weeks 9-12 (Phase 3) is still converting into fitness gains during the taper. You are literally getting fitter while training less.\n\n**What's actually happening in your body during the taper:**\n- Glycogen stores are fully replenishing (takes 48-72 hours of reduced training)\n- Muscle microtrauma from 12 weeks of training is healing, converting inflammation into structural adaptation\n- Red blood cell production that was stimulated by weeks of VO2max work is completing its cycle\n- Your central nervous system is recovering from months of high-demand training\n- Testosterone-to-cortisol ratio is normalizing (training suppresses this; taper restores it)\n\n**You cannot lose meaningful fitness in 2-3 weeks.** Research shows it takes 4+ weeks of complete inactivity to lose significant aerobic capacity. You're not inactive — you're still running 28-30 miles per week and doing race-weight station touchpoints. You're maintaining every adaptation while shedding fatigue.\n\n**Mental strategies for taper anxiety:**\n\n1. **Redirect the energy into race prep.** Write out your race plan: pacing targets, break strategies, nutrition timing, gear checklist, warm-up protocol. This gives your mind a productive focus.\n\n2. **Review your data.** Pull up your Week 10 Full Sim splits. Look at how far you've come from Week 1 baselines. The numbers don't lie.\n\n3. **The dress rehearsal in Week 14 is your confidence builder.** Half-sim at RPE 6-7 with full race weight. If it feels easy, the taper is working. That's your proof."},{"role":"user","content":"What if the dress rehearsal doesn't feel easy?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"If the Week 14 dress rehearsal feels harder than RPE 6-7, we have a diagnostic tool. Here's how to interpret it:\n\n**Possible cause 1: Residual fatigue from Phase 3 hasn't cleared.**\nThis means your body needed a longer transition. The fix: extend the easy period. Cancel the Week 15 HIIT session entirely. Make every remaining run truly easy — no strides, no pickups. Add an extra rest day. You still have 8 days until race day after the dress rehearsal, which is enough recovery time.\n\n**Possible cause 2: You went too hard on the dress rehearsal.**\nRPE 6-7 is \"comfortable-hard.\" Many athletes let competitive instinct take over during simulations and push to RPE 8-9. Check your splits — if your run paces were faster than goal race pace, you overdid it. The purpose wasn't to test your limits; it was to confirm your pacing.\n\n**Possible cause 3: External stress factors.**\nPoor sleep, work stress, travel, illness — these all compound with training fatigue. If your resting heart rate is elevated 5+ bpm above baseline, it's likely an external factor rather than a training issue.\n\n**Possible cause 4: It felt hard but your times were on target.**\nThis is the most common scenario and it's actually fine. Perceived effort during a taper is unreliable. Your body is confused by the reduced volume and interprets the lower training load as \"something is wrong.\" But if your 1 km splits were at goal pace and your station times were on target, the fitness is there. Trust the numbers over the feeling.\n\n**The only red flag:** If your times are 10%+ slower than the corresponding splits from your Week 10 Full Sim (accounting for the reduced volume), AND you have elevated resting HR, AND you're not sleeping well — then we have an issue. In that case, the remaining 8 days become pure rest: walk, stretch, sleep. No running after Day -4. Arrive at race day as fresh as possible and rely on race-day adrenaline to close the gap."}]}

Sled push technique requires a 45-degree body angle, short explosive steps, and continuous forward drive. At 80% race weight, you can focus on these cues without the sled grinding to a halt. If I put you under 152 kg in Week 1, your technique would break down immediately, you'd develop bad habits, and you'd be so fatigued that the rest of your Thursday HIIT session would be garbage.\n\nThe load progression is linear: 80% in Phase 1 → 90% in Phase 2 → 100% in Phase 3. That gives your connective tissue, your quads, and your posterior chain 8 weeks to adapt before they face race weight. Jumping straight to race weight is how people get injured.\n\n**Wall balls at 15-25 reps (not 100):**\nIn Phase 1, your total wall ball volume is 50-75 per session. Race day requires 100. The gap is intentional — 100 reps at a 6 kg ball to a 10-foot target when you're already fatigued is a significant muscular endurance challenge. You need to build that capacity progressively:\n- Phase 1: Sets of 15-25, total 50-75 per session\n- Phase 2: Sets of 25, total 75-100 per session\n- Phase 3: Full 100-rep sets using the 4x25 break strategy\n\nDuring Phase 1 HIIT sessions like the Wall Ball Endurance Builder (EMOM 16), you'll do 15 reps per minute for a total of 162 wall balls plus air squats — that's actually higher total volume than 100, but distributed across manageable sets with built-in rest. This builds the muscular endurance foundation without the technique breakdown that happens when fatigued athletes try to do 100 straight.\n\nThe Phase 1 focus is technique, aerobic capacity, and movement quality. The volume and load will come."}]}

Let me explain why this feels different and why it's exactly right.\n\n**Phase 1 squat: 4x5 @ 80% = 20 total reps at 80%**\n**Phase 3 squat: 3x4 @ 82% = 12 total reps at 82%**\n\nThe intensity is actually HIGHER in Phase 3 (82% vs 80%). The volume is lower (12 reps vs 20). That's the key shift — you're maintaining the neural drive and force production capacity (which needs heavy loads) while cutting the volume that creates muscle damage and fatigue.\n\n**Why this matters for Hyrox:** In Phase 3, your HIIT sessions have jumped to 50-65 minutes at 100% race weight with 20-40 minute continuous pieces. Your recovery resources are being consumed by sled pushes at 152 kg, 100-rep wall ball sets, and 4 km of compromised running within single sessions. If you're still doing 20 heavy squat reps with progressive overload, your body can't recover from both.\n\nThe research on concurrent training is clear: when endurance training volume is high, strength training should shift to low-volume, high-intensity maintenance to avoid the interference effect. That's exactly what 3x4 at 82% does — it tells your nervous system to maintain the ability to produce high force, without creating the systemic fatigue that would compromise your HIIT quality.\n\n**The feel test:** Your squat should feel heavy but manageable. RPE should be 7-8 on the last set. If it feels like RPE 9+ and you're grinding reps, your recovery is being compromised by the HIIT volume and we need to address that — usually through better sleep, nutrition, or dropping to 2x4 instead of 3x4.\n\nYou'll squat heavy again after the race. Right now, the squat serves the race, not the other way around."}]}

The race is won in the back half.\n- Run 2: 4:35/km — slight pickup, you're warmed up\n- Run 3: 4:40/km — hold steady post-sled push\n- Run 4: 4:45/km — slight drift allowed post-sled pull\n- Run 5: 4:50/km — settle in for the back half\n- Run 6: 4:50/km — maintain\n- Run 7: 4:50/km — maintain\n- Run 8: 4:55/km — allow 5 sec drift on the final km\n\n**Total drift budget: 15 seconds from Run 1 to Run 8.** If you're drifting more than 20 seconds, you went out too hard on the early runs.\n\n**Station Pacing:**\n- SkiErg: 3:50 — hold 1:55/500m split. This is aerobic pacing, not a sprint. Consistent pulls.\n- Sled Push: 2:50 — continuous movement, never let the sled stop. 45-degree body angle, short steps.\n- Sled Pull: 3:30 — hip extension method, rapid hand-over-hand.

Same as SkiErg — pacing, not sprinting.\n- Farmers Carry: 1:40 — fast walk, tall posture, zero planned stops. If grip fails, stop for 3-5 seconds max.\n- Lunges: 4:30 — 0.9-1.0 m stride length, touch-and-go, continuous. NO quad-dominant short steps.\n- Wall Balls: 5:30 — 4x25 break strategy. 25 reps, 5-sec rest, 25, 5-sec rest, 25, 5-sec rest, 25.\n\n**Total target: 67-72 minutes.**\n\n**Nutrition during sim:** Take one gel (25-30g carbs) between BBJ and Run 5 — that's the midpoint, roughly 35-40 minutes in.

Can I skip the Week 4 deload and keep building?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No. The deload is not optional. I know you feel strong — that's actually the point. You feel strong because the first 3 weeks of progressive loading did their job. The deload is where you cash in that investment.\n\nHere's what happens physiologically during the deload:\n\n**Running volume drops 20-25%** — from 38 miles (Week 3 peak) to 30 miles. This allows your musculoskeletal system to complete the repair cycle. Running creates repetitive micro-trauma to tendons, fascia, and bone. Three weeks of building volume needs 5-7 days of reduced loading to consolidate those adaptations.\n\n**HIIT sets cut by 30-40%** — same exercises, fewer rounds. Your energy systems maintain their capacity but the accumulated metabolic stress clears.\n\n**Strength intensity stays at 85-90% but volume halves** — 2 sets instead of 4. Your neural pathways stay engaged with heavy loads while muscle glycogen fully replenishes.\n\n**One extra rest day** — psychological recovery matters. By Week 3 of a training block, most athletes are mentally accumulating stress even if they feel physically fine.\n\n**Here's what happens if you skip it:** Weeks 5-7 (Phase 2) demand a significant jump in training — you add a 3rd HIIT session, introduce compromised running, and increase station loads to 90% race weight. If you enter Phase 2 carrying 4 weeks of accumulated fatigue instead of 3 weeks plus a deload, you'll hit a wall by Week 6. I've seen it repeatedly — athletes who skip deloads perform worse in the next training block, not better.\n\n**The deload also includes your Simulation #1 baseline benchmark.** You want that test done when you're fresh enough to give an honest performance. If you're buried in fatigue from 4 straight weeks of building, your benchmark times will be artificially slow and won't give you an accurate baseline to track progress against.\n\nTrust the periodization.

Here's the exact prescription and why it replaces the Phase 1 tempo run:\n\n**The Protocol:**\n- 2-mile warm-up at easy pace\n- 4 x 4 minutes at 85-95% of max heart rate (target: 90% HRmax)\n- 3-minute active recovery jog between intervals\n- 2-mile cool-down\n- Total session: ~8 miles, ~60 minutes\n\n**Execution details:**\n- Each 4-minute interval should be at a pace you can barely maintain for the full 4 minutes. If you can hold a conversation, you're going too easy. If you have to stop before 4 minutes, you went too hard.\n- The 3-minute jog recovery should be truly easy — barely above walking pace. Full recovery is not the goal; partial recovery is. You should start each new interval at 65-70% HRmax.\n- Track your distance covered in each 4-minute interval. Variance greater than 30 meters between intervals is a pacing failure.\n\n**Why it replaces the tempo run in Phase 2:**\n\nPhase 1's tempo run (3 miles at half-marathon pace) develops your lactate threshold — the pace you can sustain for 60-90 minutes. That's important for Hyrox running, and you built it over 4 weeks.\n\nBut Hyrox doesn't require sustained running at threshold. It requires 1 km repeats with high-intensity station work between them. The Norwegian 4x4 is a better match because:\n\n1. **VO2max development:** Research by Helgerud et al. (2007) showed 4x4 intervals improved VO2max by 11-13% in 8 weeks. Higher VO2max means you recover faster between stations and maintain pace over 8 km of total running.\n\n2. **Interval structure mimics Hyrox:** 4 minutes of hard effort followed by 3 minutes of lower-intensity work mirrors the pattern of 1 km run (4-5 min) → station work → 1 km run.\n\n3. **Heart rate exposure:** Spending 16 minutes (4 x 4) in the 85-95% HRmax zone teaches your cardiac system to operate at the upper ranges it will experience during race stations and the runs immediately following them.\n\nYou'll continue 4x4 intervals through Phase 3 (increasing to 5x4 or 6x3), then taper to 3x4 before dropping them entirely in Week 15."}]}

Segments: Run → BBJ 80 m → Run → Row 1,000 m → Run → Farmers Carry 200 m → Run → Sandbag Lunges 100 m → Run → Wall Balls 100 reps.\n---"},{"role":"user","content":"Why is there a correlation between lunges and wall balls? How does one affect the other?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"This is one of the most important race-strategy insights in all of Hyrox. HyroxDataLab found a correlation coefficient of r = 0.738 between lunge station performance and wall ball station performance. That's a strong positive correlation — athletes who perform poorly on lunges perform even more poorly on wall balls.\n\n**Why they're connected:**\n\n1. **Shared muscle groups:** Sandbag lunges (100 m at 20 kg) hammer your quads, glutes, and hip flexors. Wall balls (100 reps at 6 kg to 10 ft) also require deep quad engagement for the squat component plus hip extension for the throw. If your quads are destroyed from lunges, your squat depth decreases, your throw height decreases, and you need more reps to hit the target — or you take longer rest breaks.\n\n2. **Stride length is the key variable:** Athletes who take short steps on lunges (0.7 m stride = ~140 total steps) use a quad-dominant movement pattern that creates significantly more eccentric quad damage than athletes who take proper 0.9-1.0 m strides (~100-111 steps). The data shows athletes with short-stride lunges averaged 75 seconds slower on wall balls than those with proper stride length.\n\n3. **Glycogen depletion:** Lunges are the second-to-last station. By this point, local muscle glycogen in the quads is critically depleted. Short, choppy lunges burn through the remaining glycogen faster because they require more total repetitions (140 vs 111 steps). When you start wall balls with depleted quad glycogen, every rep is harder.\n\n**Training application:**\n\nThis is exactly why Phase 3 HIIT sessions pair lunges immediately before wall balls. The 4-Station Hyrox Block (HIIT #14) ends with Run → Lunges 100 m → Run → Wall Balls 100 reps. You're training the exact sequence so your body learns to manage the fatigue transfer.\n\n**Race-day strategy:**\n- Lock in 0.9-1.0 m stride length on lunges. Practice counting: 100 m should take 100-111 steps.\n- Use continuous touch-and-go technique — rear knee touches ground, immediately drive up. No pausing in standing position.\n- If you feel your stride shortening below 0.9 m during the race, consciously extend it. The short-term discomfort of longer strides saves you 75 seconds on the next station.\n\nThink of lunges as the setup for wall balls, not an isolated station. Manage lunges well and wall balls become manageable. Blow up on lunges and wall balls become a nightmare."}]}

Shouldn't I just rest completely?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Complete rest would actually make you slower on race day. The research is definitive on this — the optimal taper reduces volume 40-60% while maintaining or slightly increasing intensity. Here's the physiology:\n\n**Why volume drops:**\nVolume is what creates fatigue. Every mile you run, every HIIT set you complete, every heavy squat you perform creates micro-damage that requires repair. After 12 weeks of progressive training, you have significant accumulated fatigue — even if you don't feel it. Dropping volume by 40-60% gives your body the 10-14 days it needs to complete the repair cycle, replenish glycogen stores, and normalize stress hormones.\n\nSpecifically in this plan: running drops from ~36 miles to ~28 in Week 15 to just 15 in race week. HIIT drops from 3 sessions to 1 to zero. Strength goes from 1-2 sessions to zero. Session duration shrinks from 60 minutes to 30 to 20.\n\n**Why intensity stays:**\nIf you drop intensity along with volume, three things happen:\n\n1. **Neural pathways degrade.** Your nervous system's ability to recruit fast-twitch muscle fibers diminishes within 5-7 days of no high-intensity work. Strides at mile pace and 30-second race-pace pickups maintain that neural activation.\n\n2. **Race-weight familiarity fades.** Your muscles and connective tissue need to remember what 152 kg on a sled feels like. The Race Primer EMOM (10 minutes, RPE 5-6) in Week 15 touches every station at race weight with minimal volume — 10 cal SkiErg, 8 wall balls, 10 cal row, 30 m farmers carry. Enough to keep the patterns sharp, not enough to create fatigue.\n\n3. **Psychological sharpness suffers.** Complete rest for 2 weeks makes athletes feel sluggish, anxious, and disconnected from their training. Short, sharp sessions maintain the competitive edge and confidence.\n\n**The analogy:** Think of a knife. The 12 weeks of training forged the blade. The taper sharpens it. If you just leave the knife sitting on a shelf (complete rest), the edge dulls. If you keep hammering it on the anvil (maintaining full volume), the blade gets damaged. The taper is the whetstone — light, precise passes that produce a razor edge.\n\nSleep quality (8+ hours per night), daily mobility work, and nutrition quality become your primary training tools during the taper. They matter more than any workout in Weeks 15-16."}]}

You can run 4:30/km fresh all day. But can you run 4:45/km after a sled push? That's the question this workout answers and trains.\n\n2. **The run consistency test:** Your 8 run splits across 4 rounds (2 runs per round x 4 rounds) should be within 10 seconds of each other. If your first 1 km run is 4:35 and your last is 5:05, that's a 30-second drift — exactly the kind of pacing failure that costs minutes on race day. This workout teaches pacing discipline under fatigue.\n\n3. **It combines two stations with running.** Sled push → run → row → run is a 4-movement sequence that mirrors the race structure of station → run → station → run. Your body learns the metabolic pattern: high-intensity anaerobic work (sled), transition to aerobic running, another high-intensity effort (row), another aerobic transition.\n\n4. **It's deployed in Phase 2** (Weeks 5-8) specifically on Saturday PM after an 11-mile long run in the morning. That means you're doing this workout already carrying aerobic fatigue from the morning session — adding a layer of compromised-ness before the workout even starts.\n\n**Scaling:** If 4 rounds exceed the 42-minute cap, drop to 3 rounds or reduce the sled to 80% race weight (122 kg).

Station Load: 80% → 90% → 100%**\nYes, sled push goes from 122 kg to 137 kg to 152 kg. But this is actually the most gradual change.\n\n**2. Session Duration: 35-45 min → 45-55 min → 50-65 min**\nPhase 3 sessions are 40-80% longer than Phase 1 sessions. Your body needs to sustain output for significantly longer.\n\n**3. Time Domains: 10-20 min → 15-25 min → 20-40 min continuous pieces**\nA 12-minute EMOM and a 38-minute for-time chipper are fundamentally different metabolic challenges.

Work:Rest Ratios: 1:1-1:2 → 1:0.75-1:1 → 1:0.5-1:1**\nThis is arguably the biggest driver of difficulty. In Phase 1, you rest as long as you work (or longer). By Phase 3, you're working twice as long as you're resting. The Sled + Row Superset in Phase 3 gives you ~60-90 sec rest in a 5:00 window after 3:30-4:00 of continuous work. Race day gives you zero planned rest.\n\n**5. Movements Per Session: 2-4 → 3-6 → 4-8 stations**\nPhase 1 sessions pair 2-4 movements. Phase 3 sessions like the 4-Station Hyrox Block include running, rowing, farmers carry, lunges, AND wall balls in a single workout. Managing fatigue across that many different movement patterns simultaneously is a skill that takes weeks to develop.\n\n**6.

Phase 3 has 2-4 km of running sandwiched between race-weight stations. Every km run is compromised by the station that preceded it.\n\n**Phase 4 reverses all of these EXCEPT load.** Station weight stays at 100% but every other variable drops back to Phase 1 levels (shorter sessions, longer rest, fewer stations, reduced volume). That's how you maintain familiarity with race weight while shedding fatigue.\n\nThe progression across these six variables is why the 16-week plan can't be compressed. Each phase builds on the adaptations created by the previous one."}]}

You should arrive at the venue 70-90 minutes before start to handle registration, gear check, bathroom, and mental prep before the warm-up begins.\n\n**Equipment needed during warm-up:**\n- SkiErg (usually available in the warm-up area at Hyrox events)\n- Wall ball at race weight (6 kg for Men's Open)\n- Open floor space for jogging, strides, and BBJ\n- Sled at race weight (if available in warm-up area — not always guaranteed)\n\n**The 7-phase protocol:**\n\n**Phase 1 (T-40, 8 min): Aerobic Activation.** Light jog around the venue or on a BikeErg. Zone 1-2 only. This raises core temperature and gets blood flowing to working muscles.\n\n**Phase 2 (T-32, 5 min): Dynamic Mobility.** Leg swings front/back and lateral, hip circles, arm circles, ankle rolls, thoracic rotation. Every joint that will work during the race. No static stretching — it temporarily reduces power output.\n\n**Phase 3 (T-27, 8 min): Intensity Ramp.** This is the key phase — you touch race-specific movements: 500 m SkiErg at race pace (1:55/500m), 400 m run at goal race pace, 5 wall balls at 6 kg to 10 ft target, 3 burpee broad jumps. This primes the specific energy systems and movement patterns.\n\n**Phase 4 (T-19, 5 min): Race-Pace Strides.** 4 x 100 m strides at race pace with walk-back recovery. These lock in running mechanics.\n\n**Phase 5 (T-14, 4 min): Station Priming.** If a sled is available: 1 x 12.5 m push at race weight. If not: 10 bodyweight squats, 10 push-ups, 5 broad jumps. Your muscles need to feel race-weight resistance one last time.\n\n**Phase 6 (T-10, 5 min): Mental Reset.** Deep breathing — 4-count inhale, 4-count hold, 6-count exhale. Visualize your first 3 stations. Review pacing targets on your arm. Find your race-day mantra.\n\n**Phase 7 (T-5): Assembly.** Enter Start Zone, timing chip on, confirm wave number.\n\n**If equipment is limited:** The minimum effective warm-up is Phase 1 (jog), Phase 2 (mobility), Phase 4 (strides), and Phase 6 (mental reset). You can skip the SkiErg, wall balls, and sled prime if they're not available — but the jog, mobility, strides, and mental prep are non-negotiable."}]}

Nothing major — just tightness, no pop or bruise. Can I still do the rest of the week?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Stop. Don't push through this. A hamstring tweak in Week 7 — even a mild one — has the potential to derail your entire 16-week plan if you handle it wrong. Here's the protocol:\n\n**Immediate (next 48 hours):**\n- Skip Wednesday's interval run entirely. Replace it with 30 minutes of easy cycling or swimming if pain-free, or complete rest if any discomfort.\n- Ice 15 min on / 15 min off, 3 rounds, for the first 24 hours.\n- Gentle hamstring stretching only if pain-free — if it hurts to stretch, don't.\n\n**Thursday HIIT decision:**\nIf on Thursday the tightness is gone at walking pace AND you can do a bodyweight RDL with no discomfort, do a modified HIIT session: remove all running components and all hip-hinge movements (BBJ, lunges). Do upper-body and erg-only work: SkiErg, Row, Wall Balls, Farmers Carry. These don't load the hamstring significantly.\n\nIf any tightness remains at walking pace, skip Thursday entirely.\n\n**Friday:** Test with a 2-mile easy run at 9:00/mi pace. If the hamstring feels normal throughout, you're cleared for the weekend. If you feel it at all, walk home and take another rest day.\n\n**Saturday:** If Friday's test run was pain-free, do a reduced long run (8 miles instead of 11, no tempo finish). Skip the PM HIIT session.\n\n**Sunday:** Rest as always.\n\n**Week 8 adjustment:** Week 8 is your deload week with the Half-Simulation. If the hamstring is fully resolved by Monday of Week 8, proceed as planned but reduce sled push volume by 50% (2 x 50 m instead of 4). If it's still lingering, postpone the Half-Sim to the following Saturday and treat Week 8 as a recovery week.\n\n**The bigger picture:** You're 9 weeks from race day. A mild hamstring tweak that gets 4-5 days of proper management costs you maybe 15 miles of running and one HIIT session. A hamstring tweak that gets pushed through and becomes a Grade 1 strain costs you 2-3 weeks — and that's a Phase 3 problem that's much harder to recover from.\n\nBe smart. Protect the investment."}]}

How do I get back on track without blowing up the plan?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Five days off in Week 9 is tough but recoverable. You've missed the first week of Phase 3, which means you haven't yet trained at 100% race weight. Here's the adjustment plan:\n\n**Day 1 back (today):** Easy run only. 4 miles at 8:30-9:00/mi. This is a systems check — see how your breathing feels, how your legs respond, how your energy holds. If this feels like a struggle, take one more rest day.\n\n**Day 2:** If the easy run felt normal, do a modified HIIT session. Use Phase 3 station loads (100% race weight) but at 50% volume. If the plan calls for 4 rounds, do 2. If it calls for 8 sets, do 4. Your body needs to re-adapt to the training stimulus without getting crushed.\n\n**Day 3:** Resume the Phase 3 template but swap in what you missed:\n- Do a strength maintenance session (Back Squat 3x4 @ 82%, Deadlift 3x3 @ 85%) if you missed your Week 9 strength day\n- Do an interval run if you missed Wednesday's session\n\n**Days 4-7:** Resume the normal Week 10 template.\n\n**What to do about the Week 10 Full Simulation:**\nThis is your biggest decision. You have two options:\n\n**Option A (my recommendation):** Push the Full Sim to Week 11. Do Week 10 as a modified Phase 3 training week (essentially catching up on what Week 9 should have been). Then do the Full Sim on Saturday of Week 11. This means Week 12 deload stays on schedule.\n\n**Option B:** Do the Full Sim in Week 10 as planned, but expect your time to be 5-8% slower than it would have been without the illness. Accept this as a data point, not a final result.\n\n**What NOT to do:**\n- Do NOT try to cram missed sessions into the remaining weeks. The volume is gone — accept it.\n- Do NOT extend Phase 3 and shorten the taper. The taper is sacred.\n- Do NOT increase session intensity to \"make up\" for lost time. Your immune system is still recovering; pushing RPE above 8 in the first 3-4 days back risks a relapse.\n\n**The math:** You lost ~5 days of training out of a 112-day plan (16 weeks). That's 4.5%. Your race performance impact from a well-managed return is minimal — maybe 1-2 minutes at most. A poorly managed return that leads to injury or relapse could cost you the race entirely.

The 4-Station Block Simulation (HIIT #14) has a 55-minute time cap but I'm finishing in 58-60 minutes. Should I be worried?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Going 5-10% over the time cap on a Phase 3 training session is a flag but not a crisis. Let me break down what it means and what to adjust.\n\n**First, context on HIIT #14:**\nThe 4-Station Block is: Run 1 km → Row 1,000 m → Run 1 km → Farmers Carry 200 m → Run 1 km → Sandbag Lunges 100 m → Run 1 km → Wall Balls 100 reps. Target time: 38-45 minutes. Time cap: 55 minutes.\n\nIf you're hitting 58-60 minutes, you're finishing but outside the cap. That puts your projected second-half race time at roughly 60 minutes, which combined with a first-half estimate would put you around 78-82 minutes total race time.\n\n**Key question: Where is the time going?**\n\nBreak down your splits into three categories:\n1. **Run splits** — Are they at goal pace (4:40-4:55/km) or are they drifting above 5:00?\n2. **Station times** — Compare each station to the race-day targets (Row 3:50, Farmers 1:40, Lunges 4:30, Wall Balls 5:30)\n3. **Transitions** — How long between finishing a station and starting the next run? Target: under 45 seconds.\n\n**If runs are slow:** Your compromised running needs more work. The fix is to consciously lock in pace during the first 200 m of each post-station run. Use your watch. Don't just \"feel\" it — check the actual numbers.\n\n**If stations are slow:** Identify which station is the bottleneck and prioritize it in your next 2-3 HIIT sessions. If wall balls are 7+ minutes, your break strategy needs work. If lunges are 5+ minutes, check stride length.\n\n**If transitions are slow:** Practice the Roxzone jog. Finish a station, immediately start jogging, ramp to running pace within 10 seconds. Every 15 seconds of transition time adds 2 minutes to your total race time across 16 transitions.\n\n**The adjustment:** Don't reduce the workout. Instead, pick the single biggest time bleed and attack it specifically. Train that movement 2-3 extra times this week at reduced volume — 50 wall balls on an off-day, or 2 x 50 m lunge practice before a run. Small targeted additions, not more volume.\n\nYou have 6 weeks until race day. That's enough time to close a 5-minute gap if you focus on the right limiter."}]}

You're at roughly 50-60% of the volume the baseline plan assumes (35-40 mpw, 4-5 strength days). Here's how I'd modify each phase:\n\n**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4) — Extended Base Building:**\n- Running: Start at 20-22 mpw, build to 25 mpw by Week 3. 4 runs/week instead of 5. All easy pace (8:30-9:30/mi). No tempo run until Week 3, and then only 2 miles at threshold.\n- Strength: Keep at 2 sessions/week but use the Phase 1 protocol (Back Squat 3x5 at 75%, not 4x5 at 80%)\n- HIIT: 1 session/week instead of 2. Use the Station Introduction Circuit at 60% race weight (not 80%). Focus on learning all 8 movements.\n- Total: 5 training days instead of 6. Two full rest days.\n\n**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8) — Gradual Specificity:**\n- Running: Build to 28-30 mpw. Add 5th run/week. Introduce one interval session (3x4 min instead of 4x4 min at 85-90% HRmax).\n- Strength: Maintain 2 sessions. Shift to Phase 2 protocol (Front Squat 3x8 at 68%).\n- HIIT: Increase to 2 sessions/week (not 3). Station loads at 70-80% race weight. Introduce compromised running at 1.5 miles (not 2.5).\n- Total: 5-6 training days.\n\n**Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12) — Modified Competition Prep:**\n- Running: Peak at 30-32 mpw. Keep 5 runs/week.\n- Strength: Drop to 1 session (maintenance).\n- HIIT: Stay at 2 sessions/week (not 3). Station loads at 90-100% race weight. Reduce HIIT distances: 50 m lunges instead of 100, 50 wall balls instead of 100. Build to full race specs by Week 11-12.\n- Full Sim in Week 10: Modified — do 6 stations + 6 km instead of all 8.\n\n**Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16) — Same Taper Structure:**\nThe taper protocol stays the same regardless of level. Reduce volume 40-60% from YOUR peak (not the baseline plan's peak). Maintain race-weight touchpoints.\n\n**Critical difference:** Your race-day target time will be different. Instead of 67-72 minutes, you're likely looking at 85-100 minutes for a first Hyrox. That's completely fine — the periodization structure is identical, only the volume and targets scale.\n\nThe most important thing: don't try to follow the baseline plan and collapse. A completed plan at your level beats an abandoned plan at someone else's level."}]}

Phase 3 calls for 100% weight. Should I stay at 90% longer?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No — you go to 100% race weight in Phase 3 as planned. Here's why, and what we'll do about the 30-second gap.\n\n**Why we don't delay the weight increase:**\nYou have 8 weeks until race day. You need a minimum of 4-6 weeks of practice at actual race weight to develop the neuromuscular patterning and confidence to execute on race day. If you stay at 90% through Week 10 and then jump to 100%, you only get 6 weeks at race weight — and the last 4 are taper weeks with minimal sled volume. That's not enough.\n\n**The 30-second gap diagnosis:**\nYour sled push target is 2:50 at 152 kg. You're at 3:20 at 137 kg. That gap comes from one of three places:\n\n1. **Technique:** Are you maintaining a 45-degree body angle with your arms locked out? Most athletes stand too upright, which dramatically reduces horizontal force. Short, choppy steps with maximum ground contact time are faster than long, explosive steps.\n\n2. **Specific pushing power:** This is different from squat strength. Sled push is a horizontal force production pattern with isometric arm engagement. If your squat is strong but your sled is slow, the issue is likely angle and step mechanics, not raw strength.\n\n3. **Pacing within the push:** Are you going out too hard and dying on lengths 3-4? The 50 m is split into 4 x 12.5 m lengths. Your first length should not be your fastest. Aim for identical time across all 4 lengths.\n\n**The Phase 3 fix protocol:**\n- Monday PM HIIT: Include 2 x 50 m sled push at 152 kg as part of the session. Focus on body angle and step cadence.\n- Thursday HIIT: Another 2-4 x 50 m at race weight within the prescribed workout.\n- Specific cue: Set a metronome app to 120 bpm. Take one step per beat. Short, rapid steps generate more consistent force than long, infrequent steps.\n\nIn Phase 2, you did 4 x 50 m per session at 137 kg. In Phase 3, you'll do 4 x 50 m at 152 kg. The volume stays the same — only the load increases by 15 kg. Your body can handle that jump.\n\n**Realistic expectation:** At 152 kg, your sled push time will initially be 3:30-3:40. By Week 11 (after 3 weeks of practice at race weight), target 3:00-3:10. By race day, with fresh legs from the taper, 2:50-3:00 is achievable. That 30-second gap narrows because you're adapting, not because we avoided the weight."}]}

Even though you feel fine during workouts, your autonomic nervous system is telling you something is off. This is exactly what HRV and resting HR monitoring is for — detecting overreaching before it becomes overtraining.\n\n**Most likely causes in Week 11:**\n\n1. **Accumulated fatigue from Phase 3.** You're in the third week of the highest-demand training block. Running is at 36 miles, you're doing 3 HIIT sessions at 100% race weight with 50-65 minute time domains, and work:rest ratios are at their tightest (1:0.5). This is exactly when overreaching manifests.\n\n2. **Subclinical illness.** Sometimes an elevated HR is the first sign of a viral infection 24-48 hours before symptoms appear.\n\n3. **External stress.** Work, travel, poor sleep quality, or emotional stress all elevate sympathetic nervous system activity.\n\n**Immediate protocol — the next 48 hours:**\n\n1. **Today and tomorrow: reduce all training to Zone 1-2 only.** No HIIT, no intervals, no strength. Easy runs at 8:30-9:00/mi only, capped at 4 miles.\n2. **Sleep 9+ hours for the next 3 nights.** Non-negotiable.\n3. **Increase hydration and nutrition quality.** Sometimes elevated HR is partly dehydration.\n4. **Check resting HR each morning before getting out of bed.** Same position, same time.\n\n**Decision points:**\n\n- If HR returns to within 3 bpm of baseline within 48 hours: Resume training with a modified Week 11 — drop the Thursday HIIT session, keep Monday and Saturday. You'll still get 2 HIIT sessions and your runs.\n\n- If HR is still elevated after 48 hours of rest: Treat the remainder of Week 11 as an unplanned deload. Easy runs only, 20-25 miles total, no HIIT. This effectively extends your planned Week 12 deload to start early.\n\n- If HR is still elevated AND you develop symptoms (sore throat, congestion, fatigue): Full rest until symptoms resolve plus 2 additional days.\n\n**Impact on the plan:** Week 12 is your deload week with the Three-Quarter Sim. If you need Week 11 as additional recovery, push the Three-Quarter Sim to Monday or Tuesday of Week 13 (early in the taper), then resume the taper protocol from Wednesday onward. This is a minor schedule shift, not a plan-breaker.\n\nYou're 5 weeks from race day. Arriving healthy and slightly under-trained beats arriving overtrained. Listen to your body's data."}]}

If you race through this circuit, you'll develop sloppy technique that becomes embedded and costs you time on race day. Smooth is fast. Practiced is efficient. Take the full rest between stations."}]}

This is your primary sled development session for Phase 2.\n\n**Format:** Every 3:00 x 8 Sets\n**Duration:** 24 minutes\n**RPE Target:** 7-8\n**Intent:** Build sustained sled push/pull output at 90% race weight with controlled rest\n\n| Set | Movement | Load | Distance | Notes |\n|-----|----------|------|----------|-------|\n| 1 | Sled Push | 137 kg (90% race weight) | 4 x 12.5 m (50 m total) | Continuous — never let sled stop |\n| 2 | Sled Pull | 93 kg (90% race weight) | 4 x 12.5 m (50 m total) | Hip extension method, rapid hand-over-hand |\n| 3 | Sled Push | 137 kg | 50 m | Same cues as Set 1 |\n| 4 | Sled Pull | 93 kg | 50 m | Same cues as Set 2 |\n| 5 | Sled Push | 137 kg | 50 m | Push pace — aim to beat Set 1 time |\n| 6 | Sled Pull | 93 kg | 50 m | Match or beat Set 2 time |\n| 7 | Sled Push | 137 kg | 50 m | Hold technique under fatigue |\n| 8 | Sled Pull | 93 kg | 50 m | Final effort — controlled finish |\n\n**Rest protocol:** Remaining time in the 3:00 window. Target: complete each 50 m in 90-120 seconds, leaving 60-90 seconds rest.\n\n**Pacing rules:**\n- Track your split time for every 50 m effort\n- Variance greater than 10 seconds across all push sets = poor pacing (same for pull sets)\n- Set 1 should NOT be your fastest. Aim for even splits.\n\n**Total volume:** 200 m sled push + 200 m sled pull at 90% race weight\n\n**Scaling:**\n- If you cannot complete any 50 m in under 2:00: Drop to 80% race weight (122 kg push / 82 kg pull)\n- Advanced: Use 100% race weight (152 kg push / 103 kg pull)\n\n**Why this format works:** The Every 3:00 structure gives you a fixed work window that simulates race conditions — in Hyrox, you don't get to rest until you finish the station. By Set 5-6, your quads and posterior chain are accumulating fatigue, and maintaining consistent split times becomes a mental discipline challenge. That's exactly what happens after Sled Push (Station 2) going into Run 3 and then Sled Pull (Station 3) on race day.\n\n**Pair this with:** A 2-mile compromised run immediately after the final set. Your legs will feel like lead. Run at 8:30-9:00/mi and practice normalizing your gait."}]}

Focus on relaxing your upper body.\n- Run 4 (pre-Wall Balls): 4:55/km — allow 5 sec drift. You're about to do 100 wall balls.\n\n**Lunge protocol:** 0.9-1.0 m stride length, continuous touch-and-go. Count your steps — you want 100-111 total. If you feel stride shortening, consciously extend. Your wall ball performance depends on it.\n\n**Wall ball protocol:** 4x25 break strategy. 25 reps → 5 sec rest → 25 → 5 sec rest → 25 → 5 sec rest → 25. Cadence: 1 rep every 3 seconds. If Set 1 takes longer than 80 seconds, slow your cadence slightly — you started too fast.\n\n**Post-session:** 10-minute easy walk cooldown. Record all splits in your training log immediately."}]}

If you're finishing with less than 15 seconds of rest, reduce by 2 cal or 2 reps.\n\n**What this session should feel like:** Practiced. Controlled. Smooth. Your body should move through each station with automatic technique — no thought required. The SkiErg pull feels natural. The wall ball catch-and-squat rhythm is locked in. The lunge stride is 0.9-1.0 m without conscious effort.\n\nIf it feels hard, something is wrong — either the taper hasn't had enough time to work (give it another 3-4 days), or you're carrying external stress that needs addressing (sleep, nutrition, work stress).\n\n**What this session does NOT include:** Sled work (unless you have easy access), BBJ (hip flexor recovery priority during taper), or farmers carry (grip recovery). These movements are touched in other taper sessions or omitted entirely. The four movements selected are the highest-skill stations where maintaining the neural pattern has the most race-day value."}]}

Target: complete wall balls in 35-45 seconds per set, leaving 15-25 seconds rest.\n\n**Total reps:** 162 wall balls + 60 air squats\n\n**Pacing guide:**\n- Minutes 1-4: Establish your rhythm. One rep every 2.5-3 seconds. Focus on full squat depth and a smooth catch-and-squat transition.\n- Minutes 5-8: Air squats at a controlled 2-second descent. This maintains quad engagement and time under tension while giving your shoulders a break from the overhead throw.\n- Minutes 9-12: Back to wall balls. Your shoulders and quads should be working harder now. If your throw height drops below the target, reset for one breath and continue.\n- Minutes 13-16: Volume drops to 12 reps per minute. This accounts for accumulated fatigue while maintaining technique quality.\n\n**Technique cues to lock in:**\n1. Catch the ball at chest height and absorb it directly into the squat — don't catch, pause, then squat\n2. Drive through heels on the squat, release the ball at the top of hip extension\n3. Target the ball 6 inches above the target line, not AT the line — gives you margin\n4. Breathe on the catch (inhale), exhale on the throw\n\n**Scaling:**\n- Beginner: 10 reps per minute wall balls, 10 air squats\n- Advanced: 20 reps per minute wall balls, or use 9 kg ball (Pro weight)\n\n**Intensity check:** If RPE exceeds 8 by minute 8, reduce to 12 reps per set for the remainder. The purpose is building endurance, not redlining. You have 12 more weeks to build to 100 continuous reps — there's no rush.\n\n**Why EMOM format:** It forces pacing. You can't go all-out on minute 1 because you have 15 more minutes of work. This self-regulating format teaches the sustainable output pattern you'll need for race-day wall balls."}]}

I need to get better at running after burpee broad jumps."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Here's HIIT #6 — the Burpee Broad Jump + Run Coupling workout. This directly trains your ability to transition from BBJ into goal-pace running.\n\n**Format:** 5 Rounds For Time\n**Duration:** 20-28 minutes (Time Cap: 30 minutes)\n**RPE Target:** 7-8\n**Intent:** BBJ pacing discipline + compromised running at goal Hyrox pace\n\n| Round | Movement A | Movement B |\n|-------|-----------|------------|\n| Each round | Burpee Broad Jump: 16 m | Run: 400 m @ goal Hyrox pace |\n\n**Burpee Broad Jump execution:**\n- Step-up method (not jump-up) — conserves energy for the run\n- Each BBJ covers approximately 1.3-1.5 m depending on your height\n- 16 m = roughly 10-12 reps\n- Target time: 60-75 seconds per 16 m\n\n**Run execution:**\n- 400 m at goal Hyrox run pace: 4:30-4:45/km = 1:48-1:54 per 400 m\n- Use GPS watch to hold pace. The first 100 m after BBJ will feel awful — your hip flexors are screaming, your breathing is elevated. Settle into pace by 200 m.\n\n**Rest:** None between BBJ and the run (that's the whole point). Walk 30 seconds between rounds ONLY if RPE hits 9 or above. Otherwise, transition immediately from the 400 m finish back to the next BBJ set.\n\n**Tracking:**\n- Record each 16 m BBJ time separately\n- Record each 400 m split separately\n- Variance check: BBJ times should be within 10 seconds of each other. 400 m splits should be within 5 seconds of each other.\n\n**Target total time:** 22-26 minutes for all 5 rounds\n\n**Scaling:**\n- Beginner: 12 m BBJ + 300 m run per round\n- Advanced: 20 m BBJ + 600 m run per round\n\n**Why 400 m and not 1 km:** In Phase 2, we're introducing the BBJ-to-run transition. A full 1 km after BBJ is race-specific but too fatiguing for 5 rounds in a Phase 2 workout. The 400 m gives you enough distance to practice the normalization pattern (first 100 m compromised, next 300 m at pace) without accumulating so much fatigue that your BBJ technique falls apart in later rounds. Phase 3 sessions will extend this to 1 km runs.\n\n**The key adaptation:** After 5 rounds of BBJ → immediate running, your body learns to flush lactate from your hip flexors, quads, and upper body while maintaining an efficient running gait. By Week 8, the post-BBJ compromised feeling should normalize within the first 150-200 m instead of lasting 400+ m. That acceleration in recovery time is the adaptation we're training."}]}
