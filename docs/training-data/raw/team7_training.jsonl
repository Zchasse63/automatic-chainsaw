If you're hitting 9+, you sandbagged. Under 6, the loads are too heavy or your pacing broke down.\n\n**RPE:** 7 overall. Individual movements should feel like RPE 6-7 in rounds 1-4, building to RPE 8 by rounds 6-8. You should never feel like you need to stop and rest between movements \u2014 that's the pacing discipline.\n\n**Why this works as a race simulator:**\n- The run opens every round, just like Hyrox opens every station with a 1 km run. The 200m distance is scaled to keep round times at ~2:30-3:00.\n- Wall balls and SkiErg are direct station simulators. The lunges simulate the sandbag lunge station with front-loaded DBs.\n- No single movement dominates: run ~50 sec, wall balls ~45 sec, SkiErg ~40 sec, lunges ~35 sec. That's balanced loading.\n- The 20-minute domain teaches sustained aerobic pacing \u2014 exactly what you need for a race that takes 60-90 minutes.\n\n**What to track:** Write down your round times. Rounds 1-3 vs. rounds 6-8 \u2014 the gap tells you everything about your pacing. If round 1 is 2:20 and round 7 is 3:40, you went out too hot. Target less than 15% degradation from first to last round.\n\n**Scaling for next month:** Once you're consistently hitting 8 rounds with even splits, add 50m to the run (250m), or bump wall balls to 18 reps."}]}

Each round should feel like 85-90% of your max effort.\n\n**Scoring:** Record calories every round. Target consistency \u2014 no more than plus or minus 2 calories between your best and worst round. If round 1 is 20 cals and round 6 is 13 cals, your pacing is broken.\n\n**Why 1:1 work:rest at 60 seconds:**\n- 60-second work bouts sit squarely in the glycolytic energy system window (30-90 sec). This is the primary system taxed during the SkiErg station.\n- 1:1 rest means incomplete recovery \u2014 you're accumulating lactate across rounds. Your body learns to produce force while buffering hydrogen ions.\n- 6 rounds gives you 6 minutes of total high-intensity work and 6 minutes rest \u2014 a 12-minute session that packs more SkiErg-specific conditioning than a 30-minute steady-state row.\n\n**Progression over 4 weeks:**\n- Week 1: 6 rounds, 60 sec work / 60 sec rest\n- Week 2: 6 rounds, 60 sec work / 50 sec rest\n- Week 3: 7 rounds, 60 sec work / 50 sec rest\n- Week 4: 8 rounds, 60 sec work / 45 sec rest\n\n**Warm-up:** 3 min easy SkiErg, then 3 x 20 sec at moderate pace with 40 sec rest.\n\n**Common mistake:** Athletes pull with their arms. The SkiErg is a hip hinge + lat pull. Drive your hips back, snap them forward, and let your arms follow. If your biceps are fried before your lungs, your technique needs work."}]}

This format trains the exact mental model you need.\n- Movement ordering mirrors the actual race sequence: row, carry, lunges, wall balls.\n- Runs between stations replicate the 1 km legs, scaled to 400m to keep total session under 25 minutes.\n- Wall balls come LAST, when you're most destroyed. In Hyrox, wall balls are station 8 and they break people.\n\n**Pacing strategy:**\n- Row: 1:55-2:05/500m split \u2014 steady, don't blow up your legs.\n- Farmer carry: unbroken if possible. One break max at the 100m mark.\n- Sandbag lunges: steady rhythm, 12-15 lunges per minute. Don't rush.\n- Wall balls: break into sets of 15-15-15-15-15.

The 2x32 kg load targets posterior chain strength-endurance.\n- Farmer carry is a direct race station simulator at race weight. 50m per round is manageable for maintaining posture and grip.\n- DB lunges simulate the sandbag lunge station and pre-fatigue your legs for the next round of deadlifts.\n- Row in minute 4 is active recovery \u2014 you're seated, which unloads legs, but cardiac output stays elevated.

Your sled push time is largely determined by how explosively you initiate each 12.5m length. Here's how we train that.\n\n**Phosphagen Power Sprints \u2014 8 Rounds:**\n- 10 sec: All-Out Assault Bike Sprint\n- 50 sec: Complete Rest (stand, walk, shake legs)\n\n**Total session time:** 8 minutes. Record peak watts every round.\n\n**Intensity:** 95-100%. Every sprint is absolute max effort.\n\n**Why 10:50 (1:5 work:rest):**\n- The phosphagen system provides immediate energy for 5-15 seconds of max effort. After 10 seconds, ATP stores are significantly depleted.\n- 50 seconds allows ~85-90% phosphagen recovery. Full recovery takes 3-5 minutes, but 50 seconds is enough to repeat near-maximal output.\n- If we shortened rest to 30 seconds (1:3), you'd start relying on the glycolytic system \u2014 different session, different purpose.\n\n**Why the Assault Bike:**\n- Safe for absolute max-effort sprints \u2014 no eccentric loading, no technique breakdown.\n- Full body engagement \u2014 arms and legs, similar to sled push explosive demands.\n- Watts are a precise, repeatable metric.\n\n**Quality check:** Track peak watts each round. If watts drop more than 15% from round 1, the session is no longer training phosphagen \u2014 you're drifting glycolytic. Stop or extend rest to 60 seconds.\n\n**Example:** Round 1: 850W. Below 722W (850 x 0.85) = time to stop.\n\n**Progression:**\n- Week 1: 6 rounds, 10 sec / 50 sec\n- Week 2: 8 rounds, 10 sec / 50 sec\n- Week 3: 8 rounds, 12 sec / 48 sec\n- Week 4: 10 rounds, 12 sec / 48 sec\n\n**Timing:** Early in session, after warm-up but BEFORE conditioning.

You control your own pace.\n- There's no built-in rest \u2014 you choose when and how long to rest.\n- Trains self-pacing and sustained output \u2014 you manage fatigue in real-time.\n- Best for: aerobic capacity (12-20 min), benchmarking (score = rounds + reps), competition simulation, mental toughness.\n\n**For Hyrox specifically:**\n\nUse EMOMs when you want to build station-specific strength-endurance with controlled quality. Example: alternating SkiErg cals and wall balls every minute forces consistent output. Ideal for general prep phases (8-12 weeks out) when building your conditioning base.\n\nUse AMRAPs when you want to simulate race conditions and practice pacing. Hyrox is essentially a long AMRAP \u2014 you manage your own pace across 8 stations. A 20-minute AMRAP with run-station structure teaches sustainable rhythm.

Most athletes can't maintain quality unless reps are extremely low.\n- Reserve for advanced athletes doing skill-focused work.\n\n**My rule for Hyrox athletes:** Stick with 1 movement per minute (alternating) for most EMOM training. It lets you go heavier, maintain better form, and get strength-endurance adaptations. Use 2-per-minute couplets occasionally as race-simulation sessions. Skip 3-per-minute entirely unless you have a specific reason.\n\n**The critical constraint:** Whatever you prescribe must fit within the minute and leave enough rest.

Shoulders rest during squats.\n- Engine + Strength: 15-cal row + 8 DB deadlifts. Systemic alternates with local.\n- Grip-heavy + Grip-free: KB swings + burpees.

Row, wall balls, run, farmer carry, run, lunges \u2014 the runs let heart rate settle before the next station. Mimics Hyrox structure.\n\n**Rule 5: End with simple, high-output movement.**\nBurpees, row cals, or running at the end lets athletes empty the tank without technical risk. When you're destroyed, you want something you can grind through without worrying about form.\n\n**Bad ordering:** Burpees, Heavy Lunges, Sled Push, SkiErg, Wall Balls.\nProblem: Burpees fatigue everything before technical work. Lunges before sled push destroys quads. SkiErg after sled push stacks upper body pulling.\n\n**Good ordering:** SkiErg, Wall Balls, Run, Sled Push, Run, Lunges, Run, Burpees.\nWhy: Technical work first, runs as transitions, alternating patterns, simple finisher."}]}

Safety net. A 15-min workout might take 25 min. Cap at 30.\n- Intermediate: Target x 120-130%. Allows moderate pacing errors. 15 min target = 18-20 min cap.\n- Advanced: Target x 100-110%. Tight cap demands aggressive pacing. Missing it means pacing was wrong.\n\n**Step 3: Reality-check with volume estimation.**\n1. List all movements and reps.\n2. Estimate time per rep x reps for each.\n3. Sum all movement times.\n4. Add 10-15% for transitions and rest.\n5. That's your intermediate target.\n6. Apply the multiplier from Step 2.\n\n**Example:** 30-cal SkiErg (~110 sec) + 30 wall balls (~90 sec) + 30 burpees (~150 sec). Raw work = ~5:50. Add 15% = ~6:45 intermediate target. Cap: 8-9 min intermediate, 10-12 min beginner, 7 min advanced.\n\n**Common mistake:** Setting the cap too tight for beginners. If they can't finish, the workout becomes a timed AMRAP by default \u2014 different stimulus. Either scale volume so they finish, or set a generous cap."}]}

You don't repeat stations.\n- Trains mental resilience \u2014 each station brings a new challenge.\n- Drawback: Can't compare pacing across rounds (there are none).\n\n**Repeated Rounds:**\n- Same movements multiple times.\n- Example: 5 Rounds \u2014 200m Run, 15 KB Swings, 10 Push-Ups, 5 Burpees.\n- Trains pacing consistency \u2014 directly compare round 1 to round 5.\n- Exposes pacing errors: round 5 is 40% slower than round 1 = started too hot.\n- Better for benchmarking with round-to-round degradation data.\n- Drawback: Can feel monotonous.

They teach managing transitions and mentally resetting. Program 2-3 chippers per mesocycle.\n\nUse repeated rounds during base building (8-16 weeks out). Better teaching tools because the data shows exactly where pacing breaks down. When you hold consistent times across 5-7 rounds, you've built a pacing engine.\n\n**My rule:** Start training blocks with repeated rounds. As race day approaches, shift to chippers. Repeated rounds build the engine; chippers teach you to drive it through unfamiliar terrain."}]}

The goal is literally to raise your body temperature and increase blood flow to working muscles. Nothing more.\n\n**Part 2: Dynamic Movement Prep (3-4 min)**\nTarget the movement patterns you'll use in the session.

Skipping this means your first 2-3 minutes of the workout ARE the warm-up, which means wasted training time and suboptimal performance.\n\n**What NOT to do:** Static stretching before conditioning.

The wall balls breaking into sets of 5 tells me two things: (1) your shoulder endurance isn't where it needs to be for 15 unbroken wall balls under fatigue, and (2) you probably went too hard on the runs in rounds 1-3.\n\n**Fix 1 \u2014 Pacing (immediate):**\nNext time you do this AMRAP, target 3:00-3:10 for EVERY round. Yes, round 1 will feel slow. That's the point. If you start at 3:00, your round 5 might be 3:15-3:20 instead of 4:00. That gets you to 7 rounds.\n\n**Fix 2 \u2014 Wall ball endurance (next 2-3 weeks):**\nYour wall ball issue is local muscular endurance in the quads and shoulders. Add this to your training:\n- 2x per week: 5 sets of 15 unbroken wall balls with 60 sec rest between sets. Focus on breathing rhythm: inhale on the catch, exhale on the push.\n- 1x per week: Wall ball Tabata (20 sec max reps / 10 sec rest x 8 rounds). Track total reps.\n\n**Fix 3 \u2014 Break strategy:**\nIf you MUST break the wall balls, use a planned break strategy instead of random breaks when you fail. Set strategy: 10-5 or 8-7 with a 3-breath rest. Planned breaks are faster than unplanned breaks because you transition deliberately.\n\n**RPE check:** Your runs in rounds 1-3 were probably at RPE 8-9. They should be RPE 7 max.

Let's get you comfortable at race weight.\n\n**Sled weight setup:** Most gym sleds weigh 30-40 kg empty. Weigh yours or ask the gym. If it's 35 kg, you need to add ~67 kg of plates to hit 102 kg.

These are hard but you should be able to maintain form.\n- Note: 12.5m is one length of the race course. You push 4 lengths total (4 x 12.5m = 50m).\n\n**Part 3 \u2014 Compromised Running (7 min):**\n3 rounds:\n- 12.5m Sled Push at 85% race weight (~87 kg)\n- 200m Run immediately after (target: race pace, not recovery jog)\n- Rest 60 sec\n\n**Progression (4-week block):**\n- Week 1: Part 2 at 75% race weight\n- Week 2: Part 2 at 85% race weight\n- Week 3: Part 2 at 100% race weight (as written)\n- Week 4: Part 2 at 100%, extend Part 3 to 5 rounds\n\n**Supplementary strength work:** Add 3x8 heavy goblet squats and 3x10 walking lunges (front-loaded) to your strength days.

If space is limited, regular burpees still capture 55% of the stimulus.\n- Farmer carry with 2x50 lb (100 lb total) is light compared to race weight (2x24 kg = 106 lb) but close enough for training purposes.\n- Goblet lunges with a single 50 lb DB held at chest height replicate the front-loaded sandbag position.\n\n**What's missing:** SkiErg and rowing. Add 2x30-sec bursts of mountain climbers between the run and thrusters to simulate the upper-body cardio demand of the SkiErg. Not perfect, but it adds metabolic cost.\n\n**Travel tip:** Save this workout in your phone. It works in any gym with dumbbells and a treadmill. Consistency beats perfection."}]}

The most precise tool for energy system development.\n\n**Session 2 (Thursday) \u2014 EMOM:**\nFormat: 16-20 min EMOM with strength-endurance movements\nEnergy system: Aerobic power + local muscular endurance\nDuration: 25-30 min\nExample: EMOM 16 alternating SkiErg cals and wall balls\nWhy: Clock-controlled rest ensures consistent quality. Builds the strength-endurance foundation for every station.\n\n**Session 3 (Saturday) \u2014 AMRAP or For Time:**\nFormat: Race-simulation AMRAP (15-20 min) or For Time chipper\nEnergy system: Aerobic capacity + pacing\nDuration: 30-35 min\nExample: 20-min AMRAP with run-station flow\nWhy: Teaches self-pacing under race-like conditions. The closest thing to a Hyrox practice run.\n\n**How this evolves over 10 weeks:**\n- Weeks 1-4 (base building): Keep all sessions at moderate RPE (7-8). EMOMs are 12-16 min. AMRAPs are 15-18 min. Focus on learning movement patterns.\n- Weeks 5-7 (build phase): Increase EMOM to 16-20 min. AMRAP to 20 min. Add a For Time chipper once every 2 weeks on Saturday. Increase interval intensity.\n- Weeks 8-9 (peak): Full simulation once. Intervals at max intensity. Highest volume week.\n- Week 10 (taper): Reduce session duration by 30%. Maintain intensity. Rest more.\n\n**Key rule:** Don't do the same format every session. Each format trains different qualities. Intervals develop precision. EMOMs develop consistency. AMRAPs develop pacing."}]}

A heavy deadlift is 3-5 seconds of max grip. A farmer carry at race pace is 90-120 seconds of submaximal grip. Totally different stimulus. Here's your grip fix protocol.\n\n**Immediate fix \u2014 breathing and tension strategy:**\nMost athletes grip-fail because they hold their breath and death-grip the handles from the start. Instead: breathe in rhythm with your steps (inhale for 4 steps, exhale for 4 steps). Grip at 80% max \u2014 leave a 20% reserve. Your forearms fatigue faster under maximal contraction because blood flow gets occluded.\n\n**Grip-specific training plan (add to your weekly routine):**\n\n**1. Farmer Hold for Time \u2014 3x per week after your workout:**\n- 2x24 kg KBs (race weight)\n- Hold in place for max duration. Record time.\n- Rest 2 min. Repeat 3 sets.\n- Target: 90-second holds unbroken. Once you can hold for 90 sec, the 200m carry (which takes 90-120 sec) is within reach.\n\n**2. Modified Heavy Tabata \u2014 1x per week:**\n- 40 sec KB farmer hold (2x24 kg) / 20 sec rest x 6 rounds\n- This trains grip endurance under repeated bouts of fatigue. Total time under tension: 4 minutes.\n\n**3. Dead Hangs \u2014 2x per week:**\n- Hang from a pull-up bar for max time x 3 sets with 90 sec rest.\n- Target: 60+ seconds. This builds forearm endurance and works the flexor muscles from a different angle.\n\n**4. Rice Bucket or Band Extensions \u2014 Daily (5 min):**\n- Extensors are the antagonists to your grip muscles. Training them improves blood flow recovery and reduces forearm pump.\n\n**Progression test every 2 weeks:** Time your 200m farmer carry at race weight. Track drops and total time. You should see drop count decrease: 3-4 drops becomes 1-2, then 0.\n\n**Timeline:** Most athletes see significant improvement in 3-4 weeks of dedicated grip work. You don't need massive forearms \u2014 you need endurance."}]}

What's the ideal EMOM duration for my conditioning sessions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For intermediate Hyrox athletes, the sweet spot is 12-16 minutes. Here's why.\n\nThe 12-16 minute EMOM duration mirrors the glycolytic-oxidative transition zone \u2014 the exact energy system crossover that Hyrox demands. In a race, you're constantly operating in that zone where your glycolytic system is generating lactate and your oxidative system is trying to clear it. A 12-16 minute EMOM trains your body to manage that tug-of-war.\n\n**How to set your work-to-rest within each minute:**\nAs an intermediate, you should target 30-40 seconds of work per minute, leaving 20-30 seconds of rest. That's the goldilocks zone \u2014 enough work to create a meaningful training stimulus, enough rest to maintain movement quality across all rounds.\n\n**Practical test:** Choose your EMOM movements and do a single minute. If you finish in under 25 seconds, add reps or load. If you finish after 45 seconds, reduce reps or load. The 30-40 second window is your target.\n\n**Progression path:**\n- Start at 12-min EMOMs when beginning a new training block\n- Progress to 16-min over 3-4 weeks\n- Advanced athletes can extend to 20-24 min EMOMs for aerobic endurance phases\n- Only go 30+ minutes if you're in peak Hyrox prep and have solid movement foundations\n\n**Don't default to longer = better.** An 8-minute EMOM at high intensity (40-50 sec work per minute) can be more productive than a 24-minute EMOM at low intensity if your goal is power development.

Fatigue stacking rules: Avoid deadlifts then bent-over rows (lower back fatigue compounds), pull-ups then KB swings then farmer carry (grip fatigue x3), rowing then deadlifts then KB swings (posterior chain + lower back x3), heavy lunges then running then sled push (quad fatigue x3). Golden Rule: Never stack more than 2 movements with the same primary fatigue site. Insert a contrasting movement in between.\n---"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I programmed a For Time workout: Deadlifts, KB Swings, Bent-Over Rows, Farmer Carry, then a 400m Run. My coach friend said the ordering is terrible. Why?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your friend is right \u2014 that ordering violates two of the most important sequencing rules and creates serious injury risk. Let me break it down.\n\n**Problem 1: Lower back fatigue stacking.**\nDeadlifts, KB swings, AND bent-over rows all load the lower back as a primary or secondary stabilizer. Doing them consecutively means your erector spinae are under load for 3 movements in a row with zero recovery. By the time you reach bent-over rows, your lower back is so fatigued that your spinal position degrades \u2014 that's a herniated disc waiting to happen.\n\n**Problem 2: Grip fatigue stacking.**\nDeadlifts (grip), KB swings (grip), bent-over rows (grip), farmer carry (grip) \u2014 that's FOUR consecutive grip-intensive movements. Your forearms will fail long before your target muscles are adequately trained. The farmer carry especially suffers because it comes after three movements that already destroyed your grip.\n\n**Problem 3: Technical work after fatigue.**\nDeadlifts and bent-over rows both require controlled spinal position. Placing them after fatigue-inducing work means the movements most likely to cause injury are being performed in the most fatigued state.\n\n**The fix \u2014 same movements, better order:**\n\nDeadlifts (fresh, technical, lower back demand) then Push-Ups or Wall Balls (upper push, zero lower back demand \u2014 gives back a break) then KB Swings (hip hinge returns, but back has recovered) then 400m Run (systemic, no grip, lower back unloaded) then Farmer Carry (grip is fresh after run) then Bent-Over Rows (grip only used on carry, not stacked)\n\n**The golden rule applied:** Never stack more than 2 movements with the same primary fatigue site. Insert a contrasting movement between them. In your original order, you stacked 4 movements with overlapping lower back and grip demands. In the fixed version, contrasting movements break up the fatigue."}]}

My gym has barbells, dumbbells, and kettlebells."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most critical element of the sandbag lunge is the front-loaded position. The sandbag sits on your shoulders in front of your body, which forces your anterior core (abs, obliques) to work overtime to prevent you from folding forward. Any substitute MUST be front-loaded \u2014 back-loaded alternatives like barbell back rack lunges miss this entirely.\n\n**Best option with your equipment: Goblet Lunge with Heavy KB or DB (75% match)**\n\nHold a heavy KB or DB at chest height in goblet position. This replicates the front-loaded demand well. For Men's Open race weight (20 kg sandbag), use a 20-24 kg KB goblet.\n\n**Setup:** Hold the KB by the horns at sternum height. Elbows tight. Step forward into a lunge \u2014 front knee tracks over toes, back knee kisses the ground.

A KB is compact and stable. The sandbag also sits higher (on shoulders) creating a longer moment arm. The goblet position is slightly easier to balance.\n\n**Second option: Front Rack Barbell Lunge (70% match)**\nClean a barbell to the front rack position and walk lunges. This gets the front-loaded demand right and can go heavier than goblet.\n**Downside:** Requires good front rack mobility (wrist and shoulder flexibility). The barbell is rigid \u2014 no shifting like a sandbag.\n\n**Third option: Zercher Lunge (65% match)**\nBarbell in the crooks of your elbows. Unusual position but very front-loaded.\n**Downside:** Elbow crease discomfort. Some athletes hate this and it limits load.\n\n**What NOT to do:** Back-loaded lunges (barbell on your back). These are a great strength exercise but they miss the anterior core demand that makes sandbag lunges so brutal in Hyrox. The sandbag wants to pull you forward \u2014 your abs fight it. A back squat position does the opposite.\n\n**My prescription:** Goblet lunges with a 20-24 kg KB, 4 sets of 20 alternating lunges (10 per leg) with 90-sec rest, 2x per week.

A 20-min AMRAP becomes 14 minutes.\n- Reduce reps per round by 30-40%. 15 wall balls becomes 9-10.\n- Use bodyweight alternatives for weighted movements.\n\n**For Time scaling:**\n- Increase the time cap by 50-100%.

If a workout is designed to be a 15-minute aerobic effort, your scaled version should also take ~15 minutes \u2014 just with less work per round.

Replace SkiErg training with assault bike or fan bike. You lose the pulling pattern but maintain cardiovascular demand. When training for race day, if you can tolerate the SkiErg at reduced pace, practice with lighter effort \u2014 but don't push through sharp pain.\n\n**Sled Pull (Station 3):** Hand-over-hand pulling can aggravate the shoulder depending on the angle. Modify by keeping elbows close to your body (reduce shoulder abduction) and pulling more with biceps/upper back than shoulder rotation. In training, use seated cable rows with a close-grip attachment as your simulator.\n\n**Burpee Broad Jumps (Station 4):** The push-up component and the ground-to-standing transition load the shoulder. Modify in training: do sprawl + broad jump (skip the push-up, just drop chest to floor and jump). On race day, you'll need to manage this \u2014 practice the modified version.\n\n**Wall Balls (Station 8):** Overhead throwing and catching loads the rotator cuff and anterior deltoid. In training, replace wall balls with front squats or goblet squats + a partial press to whatever pain-free angle you can achieve. Use a landmine press instead of overhead press for the pressing component.\n\n**Stations that are fine:**\n- Sled Push: Arms are locked out, no rotational shoulder demand. Should be OK.\n- Rowing: Pulling is horizontal and scapular-retraction dominant. Usually tolerable.\n- Farmer Carry: Grip + trap demand, minimal rotator cuff loading.\n- Sandbag Lunges: Sandbag rests on shoulders, no overhead component.\n\n**Critical rule:** Do NOT push through sharp pain in training. Dull ache that resolves within 24 hours is acceptable. Sharp pain during a movement = stop that movement immediately and find a modification.\n\n**Supplementary rehab:** Band external rotations (3x15 daily), face pulls (3x12 with light band), and prone Y-T-W raises (2x10 each). Do these BEFORE every session as part of your warm-up. The rotator cuff responds well to high-frequency, low-intensity strengthening."}]}

Cut the general cardio (the 5-min easy row or jog). Instead, do 2 rounds of the workout movements at light load.

The conditioning block will provide some strength stimulus.\n- Option B: Merge it \u2014 add the deadlifts into the conditioning piece (e.g., add 5 deadlifts per round of the AMRAP).\nMerging is almost always better because you preserve the movement pattern.\n\n**Conditioning: Reduce from 20-25 min to 15 min.**\nThis is where the rules matter:\n1. NEVER cut intensity \u2014 if it's supposed to be RPE 8, keep it at RPE 8.\n2. Reduce time domain by 30% \u2014 a 20-min AMRAP becomes 14 min.\n3. Reduce rounds in a For Time \u2014 5 rounds becomes 3 rounds.\n4. Keep ALL movements \u2014 reduce reps instead. 15 wall balls becomes 10. 200m run becomes 150m.\n5. NEVER remove the sport-specific movements. If the workout has wall balls and bicep curls, the bicep curls go first.\n\n**Cool-down: Cut to 2 min.**\nQuick walk and breathe. Acknowledge the trade-off and do full mobility work later.\n\n**Example transformation:**\nOriginal: 10 min warm-up, 10 min back squats 5x5, 20-min AMRAP (200m run, 15 wall balls, 12 KB swings, 8 burpees), 5 min cool-down.\nCompressed: 5 min warm-up, 14-min AMRAP (150m run, 10 wall balls, 5 back squats at moderate weight, 8 KB swings, 6 burpees), 2 min walk.\n\nThe squats got merged into the AMRAP.

The good news: you can train 80% of the stimulus without any forward travel. Here's how.\n\n**Best option: Burpee + Tuck Jump in place (80% match)**\nPerform a standard burpee (chest to floor, push up, stand) then immediately explode into a vertical tuck jump \u2014 pull your knees to your chest at the peak. Land softly and drop right into the next rep.\n\n**What it captures:** The full ground-to-standing-to-explosive-jump pattern, which is the primary physical demand. The metabolic cost is nearly identical to a burpee broad jump. The tuck jump requires explosive hip extension, which is the same engine that powers the broad jump.\n**What it misses:** Forward locomotion and the horizontal hip extension angle. In Hyrox, each broad jump propels you forward, and your jump distance determines how many total reps you need for 80m. The tuck jump is vertical, not horizontal.\n\n**Second option: Sprawl + Vertical Jump (65% match)**\nDrop to a sprawl (chest touches floor but skip the full push-up) then explode up into a max-height jump. This is faster than a full burpee, which lets you focus on explosive power.\n\n**Third option: Burpee + Step Forward (modified)**\nDo a standard burpee, then take 2 large steps forward instead of jumping. This preserves the locomotion component in minimal space. You'll cover about 1-1.5m per rep instead of 1.5-2m with a broad jump.\n\n**Training prescription for limited space:**\n- 2x per week: 5 sets of 10 burpee + tuck jumps with 90-sec rest. Focus on jump height and explosive intent.\n- 1x per week (if you can find outdoor space): Practice actual burpee broad jumps for distance. A hallway, driveway, sidewalk, or park. Even 15-20 reps of real broad jumps per week maintains the movement pattern.\n\n**Race day tip:** Your apartment training builds the engine (fitness, explosiveness, tolerance). But you NEED at least a few sessions with real broad jumps before race day \u2014 the horizontal hip angle is different enough that you want to be familiar with it. Find outdoor space once per week in the final 4-6 weeks."}]}

It provides full-body cardiovascular demand with significant leg drive \u2014 the two most important elements of the rowing station.\n\nWhat it captures: Full-body engagement, sustained effort, leg drive importance, cardiovascular demand similar to rowing.\nWhat it misses: No pulling pattern (bike is push/pull vs row is primarily pull), different muscle recruitment in the upper body, no flywheel resistance feel.\n\n**Training translation:** For every 1,000m row interval in your program, substitute with a time-equivalent bike interval. Most athletes row 1,000m in 3:30-4:30. Use that duration on the bike: 3:30-4:30 at equivalent RPE.\n\n**Calorie translation:** Roughly, 1,000m row = 30-40 cal on assault bike at similar intensity for men, 22-30 cal for women. These aren't exact \u2014 bike cals depend heavily on the athlete \u2014 but it's a starting point.\n\n**Supplementary rowing pattern work:**\nSince the bike doesn't train the pulling pattern, add this after your bike intervals:\n- 3 x 15 heavy bent-over DB rows (2x22.5 kg) with 60-sec rest\n- This adds the upper back and lat endurance that the bike misses\n\n**Combined approach for best results:**\nIf you occasionally have access to a rower, use it for technique and pacing practice (once per week). Use the bike for all your high-intensity conditioning intervals. The aerobic fitness transfers between the two \u2014 you won't lose cardiovascular capacity by biking instead of rowing.\n\n**Worst case \u2014 no bike either:**\nCombine ring rows + air squats in a circuit. 10 ring rows + 15 air squats, repeat for 3:30-4:30.

Hyrox transfer: Run = direct. Wall balls = Station 8 direct. KB swings = sled push/pull hip drive. Burpees = Station 4 direct. You're training for 4 race elements in one workout.\n5. Time balance: Run ~50 sec (30%), wall balls ~36 sec (22%), KB swings ~25 sec (15%), burpees ~30 sec (18%), transitions ~25 sec (15%). No bottleneck.\n\n**Estimated round time:** ~2:45.

Estimated time: 18-22 min for intermediate. Every rep is meaningful.\n\n**General rule:** If a For Time workout takes more than 30 minutes, question whether the volume is justified. Most Hyrox conditioning sessions should be 15-25 minutes of work. Save the 45+ minute sessions for full race simulations, and do those sparingly \u2014 once every 4-6 weeks."}]}

Should I skip them in workouts or is there a substitution that's actually worth doing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Never skip them \u2014 substitute with ring rows. Ring rows are not a consolation prize; they're a legitimate pulling exercise that builds the exact muscles you need for Hyrox (lats, biceps, upper back) while being infinitely scalable.\n\n**Why ring rows, not lat pulldowns:**\nRing rows train horizontal pulling in a bodyweight context. You control the difficulty by adjusting your foot position \u2014 the more horizontal your body, the harder the movement. Lat pulldowns are machine-stabilized and don't train your core to stabilize during the pull.\n\n**Scaling ring rows to match your level:**\n- Easiest: Feet close to the rings, body nearly vertical (~45 degrees). This is maybe 30% of a pull-up's difficulty.\n- Moderate: Feet further away, body at ~30 degrees from horizontal. This is roughly 50-60% of a pull-up.\n- Hardest: Feet on a box, body completely horizontal (parallel to floor). This is 70-80% of a pull-up's difficulty.\n- Beyond: Feet elevated on a box + weighted vest. Now you're approaching full pull-up difficulty.\n\n**How to substitute in workouts:**\nWherever a workout calls for pull-ups, do the same number of ring rows at a difficulty level where the last 2 reps are challenging but achievable. If the workout says 6 pull-ups, do 6 ring rows with your body at 30 degrees.\n\n**Hyrox relevance:** Pull-ups aren't a Hyrox station, but the pulling muscles (lats, biceps, upper back) are critical for SkiErg performance and sled pull. Ring rows train these muscles effectively. You're not missing out on Hyrox-specific adaptation by doing ring rows instead of pull-ups.\n\n**Progress toward pull-ups:** If you want to eventually do pull-ups, add 3x5 negative pull-ups (jump to the top, lower yourself for 5 seconds) after your conditioning sessions 2x per week. Most athletes achieve their first pull-up within 6-8 weeks of dedicated negative work."}]}

In 12 min, you can afford to push harder (RPE 7.5-8) because the duration is shorter.\n- Total volume decreases by ~40%: You'll do fewer rounds, which means less total practice of each movement.\n\n**Your options:**\n\n**Option A \u2014 Same workout, accept the different stimulus:**\nDo the exact same movements and reps for 12 minutes. Push the pace slightly harder than you would in 20 minutes. Accept that you're training a different energy system today. This is totally fine \u2014 you're still getting quality conditioning.\n\n**Option B \u2014 Adjust reps to preserve round count:**\nReduce reps per movement by 20-25% so that your round count is similar to what it would be in 20 minutes, compressed into 12. If the original calls for 15 wall balls per round, do 11-12. This keeps the pacing practice similar.\n\n**Option C \u2014 Switch to a different format entirely:**\nIf the purpose of today's session is aerobic capacity and 12 minutes isn't enough, switch to an EMOM 12 with the same movements. The EMOM format controls rest and keeps you in an aerobic zone even in a shorter time domain.\n\n**My recommendation:** Go with Option A most of the time. A 12-minute AMRAP at slightly higher intensity is still excellent training. Don't overthink it \u2014 getting the work done matters more than perfectly matching the original prescription."}]}

My gym doesn't have a wall ball target and I hate thrusters."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Front squats alone are not a sufficient wall ball substitute. They capture the squat pattern but miss the pressing component entirely, which makes them about a 50% match. Wall balls are a SQUAT-TO-PRESS movement \u2014 the overhead throw is what makes them so metabolically demanding and shoulder-fatiguing.\n\n**Why this matters for Hyrox:**\nThe wall ball station at the end of a Hyrox race is brutal specifically because your shoulders and quads are both working simultaneously for 75-100 reps. Front squats only train the quads. By race day, your quads might be ready but your shoulders will be untrained for that specific demand.\n\n**Better options since you hate thrusters:**\n\n**Option 1: Front Squat + Push Press as separate movements (65% match)**\nDo 1 front squat + 1 push press as a two-part complex. This isn't as fluid as a wall ball or thruster, but it trains both patterns.\nPrescription: Where a workout calls for 15 wall balls, do 15 front squat + push press complexes with a moderate barbell (30-40 kg).\n\n**Option 2: Goblet Squat + DB Push Press combined (70% match)**\nHold a single heavy DB in goblet position. Squat to full depth, drive up, transition to a push press overhead with both hands. Less awkward than a thruster if you dislike the front rack position.\nPrescription: Use a single 15-20 kg DB. Same rep count as prescribed wall balls.\n\n**Option 3: Med Ball Cleans + Press (60% match)**\nIf you have a med ball but no target, clean the ball from the ground to your shoulders (full squat), then press it overhead. This adds ball handling and squat depth but lacks the target accuracy and rhythm.\n\n**What I'd actually recommend:** Find a target. You don't need a commercial wall ball target \u2014 a mark on a wall at 10 feet (3.0m for men, 2.7m for women) works. Even a piece of tape on a garage wall or outdoor building wall. The target is critical because it forces full extension and creates the rhythm pattern that makes wall balls unique. Once you have a target, even a basketball or soccer ball works for practicing the movement pattern at lower loads.\n\n**If you truly cannot find ANY target:** Go with Option 2 (goblet squat + DB push press). It's the least awkward alternative that still trains both patterns."}]}

A Hyrox simulation is your dress rehearsal \u2014 it needs to be performed on relatively fresh legs. Heavy back squats the day before will leave you with DOMS, reduced power output, and compromised running. Your simulation data will be artificially worse, which defeats the purpose.\n\n**Modification option:** Instead of heavy squats (e.g., 5x5 at 80-85%), do a light squat primer: 3x5 at 50-60% of your max. This activates the motor pattern and gets blood flowing without creating fatigue or soreness. Think of it as movement prep for tomorrow.\n\n**If the strength session is the priority (base building, 10+ weeks out):**\nDo the squats. Modify tomorrow's simulation to account for fatigue \u2014 run at 90% pace, reduce station volumes by 20%. Your legs will be compromised, which actually has a training benefit: it simulates the kind of leg fatigue you'll experience mid-race. Just don't treat the simulation as a benchmark test when your legs are pre-fatigued.\n\n**The ideal scheduling solution:**\nSeparate heavy lower-body strength from simulation days by at least 48 hours. If your simulation is Saturday, do heavy squats Wednesday at the latest.\n\n**Weekly template example:**\n- Monday: Heavy squats + upper body strength\n- Tuesday: Easy run\n- Wednesday: Glycolytic intervals (moderate leg demand)\n- Thursday: Easy run or rest\n- Friday: Light movement prep only\n- Saturday: Hyrox simulation on fresh legs\n- Sunday: Recovery\n\n**Bottom line:** Heavy squats 24 hours before a simulation is poor scheduling. If it's a one-time conflict, modify the squats to a light primer. If this keeps happening, restructure your week."}]}

But the question of whether to train heavier is a good one.\n\n**Training at race weight (14 lb):**\nPros: Specificity. You practice the exact load and throwing rhythm you'll use on race day. The neuromuscular pattern \u2014 squat depth, press angle, ball velocity \u2014 is dialed in.\nCons: No overload stimulus. Your muscles adapt to 14 lb and plateau.\n\n**Training heavier (20 lb / 9 kg):**\nPros: Overload principle. When you return to 14 lb, it feels light. Your strength endurance improves faster. Your muscular ceiling rises.\nCons: Different rhythm \u2014 a heavier ball travels slower and requires more effort per rep, which changes your pacing pattern. Can be counterproductive if done exclusively.\n\n**My recommendation \u2014 periodize both:**\n\n**General prep (8+ weeks out):**\nTrain with a 20 lb ball, 2x per week. This builds the strength reserve. Do 5 sets of 15 at 20 lb with 60-sec rest. Your shoulders and quads will adapt to the heavier load.\n\n**Competition prep (4-8 weeks out):**\nSwitch to race weight (14 lb) exclusively. Now everything feels lighter. Focus on unbroken sets, rhythm, and hitting the target consistently. Practice your race break strategy (e.g., 25-25-25-25 or 20-20-20-15-5).\n\n**Peak week (1-2 weeks out):**\nRace weight only, reduced volume. 2 sets of 20 wall balls to keep the pattern sharp without accumulating fatigue.\n\n**Additional tip:** Always train to the correct target height (9 ft for Women's Open). Training with the right height matters as much as the right weight \u2014 the throwing angle and release point need to be automatic on race day."}]}

Running and lunges CAN be paired effectively \u2014 Hyrox literally requires you to run 1 km and then do 100m of sandbag lunges in sequence. The question isn't whether to pair them, but HOW to pair them in training.\n\n**When running + lunges is fine:**\n- When they're separated by another movement (run, wall balls, THEN lunges \u2014 the wall balls give your quads a partial break while loading shoulders).\n- When the run is moderate distance (200-400m) and the lunges are moderate volume (10-15 reps). The total quad demand is manageable.\n- When this is the specific race combination you're training for. You SHOULD practice running into lunges because that's what Hyrox demands.\n\n**When running + lunges is problematic:**\n- When they're immediately back-to-back with nothing in between AND the volume is high (800m run + 50 lunges). That's quad fatigue stacking without relief.\n- When you add a THIRD quad-dominant movement in the same circuit (run + lunges + sled push = triple quad stacking). This is the real danger.\n- When you're in early general prep and don't need that level of specificity yet.\n\n**The golden rule applied:** Never stack more than 2 movements with the same primary fatigue site. Running + lunges = 2 quad-dominant movements. That's fine. Running + lunges + sled push = 3. That's too much.\n\n**Good pairing example:**\n200m Run, 10 Lunges, 12 Wall Balls, 10 KB Swings\n(Run = quads, Lunges = quads, Wall balls = shoulders/quads shared, KB swings = posterior chain. The wall balls serve as a bridge between front-chain dominance and posterior chain.)\n\n**Bad pairing example:**\n400m Run, 20 Lunges, 50m Sled Push, 20 Box Jumps\n(Run = quads, Lunges = quads, Sled push = quads, Box jumps = quads. Four consecutive quad-dominant movements. Your legs will fail.)\n\n**Bottom line:** The person who told you that was protecting you from a real risk (quad fatigue stacking) but stated it too broadly. Run + lunges is a Hyrox-essential pairing. Just manage what goes around them."}]}

If a workout calls for 12 wall balls, do 18. If it's 5 rounds, do 7. This increases total work without changing the load, which preserves movement quality while pushing your conditioning ceiling higher.\nRep range: 110-120% of prescribed reps.\n\n**Lever 2: Increase load to Pro weights.**\nIf you're racing Men's Open (2x24 kg farmer carry, 20 kg sandbag, 6 kg wall ball), train with Men's Pro weights:\n- Farmer carry: 2x32 kg (instead of 2x24 kg)\n- Sandbag lunges: 30 kg (instead of 20 kg)\n- Wall balls: 9 kg/20 lb (instead of 6 kg/14 lb)\n- Sled push: 202 kg total (instead of 152 kg)\nThis builds a massive strength reserve. Race day at Open weights will feel comfortable.\n\n**Lever 3: Tighten time domains.**\nReduce AMRAP from 20 min to 15 min but keep the same prescribed reps. You have to work faster, which increases intensity without changing load.\n\n**Lever 4: Add complexity.**\nUpgrade movements: burpees become burpee broad jumps. KB swings become heavier. Push-ups become deficit push-ups. This increases difficulty per rep.\n\n**What NOT to do:**\n- Don't go above 120% of prescribed load for conditioning work. Heavy singles and triples belong in strength sessions, not AMRAPs.\n- Don't extend time domains beyond 30 minutes. Longer isn't harder \u2014 it's just longer. Increase density instead.\n- Don't stack all levers simultaneously. Increase ONE variable at a time.\n\n**Competition-phase scaling:** In the 4-6 weeks before race day, return to exact race weights but at higher volume and intensity.

Here's how to diagnose which one.\n\n**Technique check \u2014 the three common failures:**\n\n**1. Catching the ball too high.**\nIf you're catching the ball above your forehead and then squatting down, you're doing extra work. The ball should be caught at chin to chest height as you're already descending into the squat. The catch and the squat should be ONE motion, not two. Catching high means you absorb the ball, pause, THEN squat \u2014 that's two movements and your shoulders are doing isometric work holding the ball for an extra second each rep. Over 100 reps, that's 100 extra seconds of shoulder work.\n\n**2. Not using your legs.**\nThe power for the throw comes from your legs \u2014 it's a squat-to-press, not a squat-then-press. If you're muscling the ball up with your arms, your shoulders fatigue 2-3x faster. Cue: drive hard out of the bottom of the squat, and let the momentum carry the ball up. Your arms guide it; your legs launch it.\n\n**3. Arms too extended.**\nIf you're holding the ball away from your body (arms extended), the moment arm on your shoulders is longer. Keep the ball close to your chest, elbows tucked. Less lever arm = less shoulder demand.\n\n**Strength check:**\nIf your technique is good and your shoulders still fail at 50-60 reps, you need shoulder endurance work.\n\n**Shoulder endurance prescription:**\n- 2x per week: 5 sets of 15 unbroken wall balls with 60-sec rest. RPE 6-7. Focus on rhythm.\n- 1x per week: 3 sets of 20 DB push press (2x10 kg) with 45-sec rest. This builds the pressing endurance.\n- 1x per week: Wall ball Tabata (20 sec work / 10 sec rest x 8 rounds). Track total reps across all 8 rounds.\n\n**Break strategy for race day:**\nDon't try to go unbroken. Plan your breaks: 25-25-25-25 or 20-20-20-20-20. Planned breaks of 3-5 breaths are faster than unplanned breaks where you stare at the ball for 15 seconds trying to convince yourself to pick it up.\n\n**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks of dedicated wall ball volume + technique fixes and you'll push through 75+ unbroken."}]}

With a 10-minute mile, you're looking at 50-55 minutes of RUNNING ALONE in a Hyrox. Elite times for the full race are 55-65 minutes. You need to cut your mile pace significantly.\n\n**Running plan:**\n- Start: 3 runs per week. 2 easy runs (25-30 min at conversation pace, whatever pace that is) + 1 tempo run (15-20 min, 10-15 sec/mile faster than easy pace).\n- Progress: Add 5 minutes per week to easy runs. Add a 4th easy run in week 4.\n- Target by week 8: 4 runs per week, 35-40 miles total, easy pace under 9:00/mile.\n- Don't worry about speed yet. Volume first. The aerobic base comes from easy miles.\n\n**Priority 2: Convert strength to strength-endurance (ongoing).**\nYou can deadlift 500 lbs \u2014 that's irrelevant for Hyrox. What matters is whether you can carry 2x24 kg for 200m without stopping, push a 152 kg sled for 50m at a fast pace, and lunge with 20 kg for 100m. These are strength-ENDURANCE tasks. Your max strength is overkill; your endurance at sub-max loads is the question.\n\n**Strength-endurance conversion:**\n- Replace heavy low-rep strength (5x3, 3x5) with moderate-load high-rep work (4x15-20).\n- Add loaded carries and lunges for distance, not reps. Farmer carry: 4 x 50m at race weight. Goblet lunges: 4 x 25m.\n- Keep ONE heavy strength day per week (your existing powerlifting work) to maintain your base. Convert the other lifting days to EMOM or AMRAP conditioning.\n\n**Priority 3: Learn the stations (weeks 4-12).**\nYou need to practice wall balls (100 reps is a muscular endurance challenge even for strong athletes), SkiErg (technique-dependent), rowing (technique-dependent), and burpee broad jumps (cardio + full-body coordination).\n\n**Sample weekly schedule:**\n- Mon: Heavy strength (squat or deadlift, maintain) + 2 sets wall ball practice\n- Tue: Easy run 30 min + core work\n- Wed: EMOM 16 (station-specific conditioning) + easy run 20 min\n- Thu: Easy run 30 min\n- Fri: AMRAP 15-20 (Hyrox simulation movements)\n- Sat: Long easy run (40-50 min)\n- Sun: Rest\n\n**Timeline reality check:** With a 10-minute mile starting point, you need at minimum 12-16 weeks to be race-ready. Don't rush to race. Build the aerobic base first."}]}

Here's how to use it strategically.\n\n**Use 1: Rowing substitute (70% match)**\nWhen the rower is taken or unavailable, the assault bike replicates the full-body cardiovascular demand. For every 1,000m row in your program, substitute with a time-equivalent bike interval (typically 3:00-4:30 at matching RPE). The bike misses the pulling pattern but captures the leg drive and cardiac output.\n\n**Use 2: Phosphagen power sprints**\nThe bike is the safest tool for all-out max-effort sprints. No technique breakdown at max output, no eccentric loading, instant resistance.\n- 8 x 10 sec all-out / 50 sec rest. Record peak watts.\n- This develops the explosive power that transfers to sled push starts and burpee broad jumps.\n\n**Use 3: Glycolytic intervals**\n- 6 x 30-sec max-cal / 30-sec rest. Score = total calories.\n- Or: 5 x 60-sec hard / 60-sec easy (don't stop pedaling, just reduce effort)\n- These build the same lactate buffering capacity as SkiErg or rowing intervals.\n\n**Use 4: Active recovery between stations in a circuit**\nIn a multi-movement circuit, use 10-15 calories of easy bike as your \"running\" substitute if you can't run (weather, space, knee issues). It keeps cardiac output elevated while unloading legs from high-impact work.\n\n**Use 5: Warm-up tool**\n3-5 minutes of easy biking is one of the best warm-ups \u2014 full body engagement, zero impact, easy to control intensity. Better than a treadmill walk for Hyrox because it engages arms.\n\n**Sample assault bike session for Hyrox:**\nEMOM 16:\n- Min 1: 12/10-cal Assault Bike (hard)\n- Min 2: 12 Wall Balls (20 lb)\n- Min 3: 10 KB Swings (24 kg)\n- Min 4: 200m Run\n\nThe bike replaces the SkiErg in this rotation. You get upper body + lower body cardio (bike), pushing/squatting (wall balls), hip hinge (swings), and running. Four patterns, four stations, well-balanced."}]}

Then you run 1 km on those dead quads. Then you do 75-100 wall balls which are ALSO quad-dominant (deep squat every rep). Here's how to train specifically for that sequence.\n\n**Lunge-to-Run-to-Wall Ball Circuit \u2014 4 Rounds For Time:**\nTime Cap: 28 min\n\n- 50m Goblet Lunges (20 kg KB/DB, front-loaded)\n- 400m Run (race pace \u2014 NO walking, NO jogging)\n- 25 Wall Balls (20 lb to 10-ft target)\n\n**RPE:** 8-9 by rounds 3-4. The first round should feel hard but manageable. By round 4, your quads should be on fire and the wall balls should require planned breaks.\n\n**Target time:** 20-24 min for intermediate. Under 20 is advanced.\n\n**Why this specific structure:**\n- 50m lunges per round (200m total across 4 rounds) replicates the race volume. Front-loaded goblet position mimics the sandbag.\n- 400m run immediately after lunges trains the compromised running that kills most athletes. Your quads are full of lactate, your stride shortens, your pace drops. This is where you learn to keep moving.\n- 25 wall balls per round (100 total across 4 rounds) matches the race volume exactly. And they come when your quads are already cooked from lunges and running \u2014 just like the race.\n\n**Pacing strategy:**\n- Lunges: Steady rhythm, 12-14 lunges per minute. Short steps = more reps = more time. Take full steps.\n- Run: The first 100m will be ugly. Focus on upright posture and arm drive. Don't try to force pace \u2014 let it come. Target 5:00-5:30/km.\n- Wall balls: Break into planned sets. Round 1: 15-10 or 13-12. Round 4: 10-8-7 or 8-8-5-4. Accept smaller sets in later rounds.\n\n**Progression:**\n- Weeks 1-2: 3 rounds, 30m lunges, 300m run, 20 wall balls\n- Weeks 3-4: 4 rounds as written\n- Weeks 5-6: 4 rounds, increase lunges to 75m and wall balls to 30\n- Week 7-8: 5 rounds at original volume (this overshoots race volume for a training buffer)"}]}

Complete rest for a full week actually detrains you \u2014 you lose cardiovascular fitness faster than you'd expect (measurable VO2max decline in as few as 7-10 days of inactivity). A deload week reduces volume and intensity while maintaining frequency and movement patterns.\n\n**The deload formula:**\n- Volume: Reduce by 40-50% (fewer rounds, fewer reps, shorter durations)\n- Intensity: Reduce to RPE 5-6 (everything should feel easy to moderate)\n- Frequency: Keep the same (if you train 5x per week, still train 5x)\n- Movements: Keep the same exercises \u2014 just lighter and shorter\n\n**Example deload week (assuming a 4-session/week Hyrox program):**\n\n**Session 1 \u2014 Easy EMOM 12 (instead of hard EMOM 20):**\n- Min 1: 10-cal SkiErg (easy pace)\n- Min 2: 8 Wall Balls (14 lb or lighter)\nRPE: 5. Should feel like warming up.\n\n**Session 2 \u2014 Easy Run + Movement Practice:**\n- 25-min easy run at RPE 5 (conversation pace)\n- Then: 2 rounds of 10 wall balls, 5 burpees, 25m farmer carry at light weight. Just practicing movements, not training hard.\n\n**Session 3 \u2014 Light Intervals:**\n- 4 x 60-sec SkiErg / 90-sec rest at RPE 6 (instead of 8 x 60-sec / 60-sec rest at RPE 8-9)\n- Then: Light core work \u2014 3 rounds of 20-sec plank, 10 dead bugs.\n\n**Session 4 \u2014 Short AMRAP at low intensity:**\n- 10-min AMRAP (instead of 20-min) at RPE 5-6:\n  - 150m Run, 8 Wall Balls, 6 KB Swings, 4 Burpees\n- Not chasing a score. Moving well, breathing easy.\n\n**When to deload:**\n- Every 3-4 weeks during a training block\n- After a full simulation workout\n- When resting heart rate is elevated 5+ bpm for 3 consecutive days\n- When motivation drops, sleep quality declines, or performance stagnates for 2+ weeks\n\n**What a deload does:** Allows the connective tissues (tendons, ligaments, fascia) to recover. Muscles recover quickly (48-72 hours) but tendons and joints need 7-10 days of reduced loading to fully adapt. That's why deload weeks exist \u2014 they let the slow-adapting tissues catch up to the fast-adapting muscles."}]}

Each minute should take 40-50 seconds, leaving only 10-20 seconds rest. This is advanced territory \u2014 the rest windows are tight by design.\n\n**Why this is peak prep appropriate:**\n- 24 minutes is the longest EMOM duration I recommend for Hyrox. It simulates sustained output over race-relevant time.\n- Four movements covering four different Hyrox stations means you're training transitions and pattern switching under fatigue.\n- The density is high: 40-50 sec work per minute means your body is working at near-continuous output. This mirrors the race where there's no real rest between stations and runs.\n- 6 complete rounds means you practice maintaining quality from minute 1 to minute 24. If your round 6 performance craters compared to round 1, your race-day fitness has a gap.\n\n**Performance benchmarks:**\n- SkiErg: 18 cals should take 38-45 sec. Under 35 sec = you're underperforming. Over 50 sec = reduce to 15 cals.\n- Wall balls: 15 unbroken should take 40-48 sec. If breaking into sets by round 4, reduce to 12.\n- Farmer carry: 50m should take 30-40 sec with setup. If grip fails, you need more carry-specific work.\n- Burpee broad jumps: 12 should take 40-50 sec. If form degrades (short jumps, lazy chest-to-floor), reduce to 10.\n\n**Warm-up:** Extensive \u2014 8-10 min. 3 min easy row, then 2 rounds of each movement at 50% intensity.\n\n**Post-session recovery:** 5 min walk, full-body stretch. This session creates significant delayed-onset soreness. Plan an easy day tomorrow.\n\n**Next 3 weeks:** Do this session once. Then taper: Week 2 = EMOM 16 at same movements but reduced reps. Week 3 = EMOM 12 at low intensity."}]}

Is CrossFit enough to train for Hyrox?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "CrossFit builds a strong general fitness base that absolutely helps with Hyrox \u2014 but it's not sufficient as your primary preparation. Here's why.\n\n**What CrossFit gives you for Hyrox:**\n- Broad conditioning across multiple time domains and movement patterns. This is valuable.\n- Wall ball proficiency \u2014 wall balls are a CrossFit staple.\n- Rowing and SkiErg familiarity \u2014 many CrossFit gyms have these.\n- Mental toughness under fatigue \u2014 CrossFit competition formats teach this well.\n- General strength-endurance \u2014 varied high-rep work with moderate loads.\n\n**What CrossFit does NOT give you:**\n\n**1. Enough running.** Hyrox has 8 km of running. Most CrossFit programming includes maybe 200-400m runs within workouts \u2014 not the sustained 1 km repeats at race pace that Hyrox demands. Your running needs specific training.\n\n**2. Sled-specific work.** CrossFit rarely programs sled pushes and pulls at Hyrox race weights for Hyrox distances. The 50m sled push at 152 kg (Men's Open) is a unique strength-endurance challenge.\n\n**3. Farmer carry at distance.** CrossFit might do a 50m carry in a workout. Hyrox is 200m with heavy KBs. The grip endurance required is significantly higher.\n\n**4. Sandbag lunges.** CrossFit uses barbells and DBs for lunges. Sandbag lunges with the weight on your shoulders in a bear hug position have a completely different anterior core demand.\n\n**5. Compromised running.** The ability to run well after heavy station work is the single most Hyrox-specific skill. CrossFit rarely trains this because CrossFit workouts don't typically have 1 km runs between stations.\n\n**6. Race-specific pacing.** Hyrox is 60-90 minutes of sustained effort. Most CrossFit workouts are 8-20 minutes. The pacing strategies are completely different.\n\n**My recommendation:** Keep doing CrossFit 2-3x per week for general conditioning, but ADD:\n- 3-4 runs per week (including one long run of 45-60 min)\n- 1 Hyrox-specific simulation per week (compromised running circuit or race simulation AMRAP)\n- 1 station-specific session (sled work, farmer carry, sandbag lunges)\n\nCrossFit is a solid foundation.

The key is making your breaks short, planned, and strategic rather than random and desperate.\n\n**The break strategy framework:**\n\n**Step 1: Know your unbroken capacity under fatigue.**\nAfter a hard conditioning session, test how many wall balls you can do unbroken at race weight before form breaks down (short squat, missing target, resting with ball on floor). Whatever that number is, plan your race sets at 70-80% of it.\n\nExample: You can do 25 unbroken when fresh, maybe 18-20 after a hard workout. Race day sets: 15-17 reps.\n\n**Step 2: Pick a break pattern that totals your race number.**\n\nFor Men's Open (100 reps):\n- Conservative: 10 sets of 10 with 3-breath breaks. Total break time: ~45 sec.\n- Moderate: 5 sets of 20 with 5-breath breaks. Total break time: ~30 sec.\n- Aggressive: 4 sets of 25 with 3-breath breaks. Total break time: ~18 sec.\n\nFor Women's Open (75 reps):\n- Conservative: 5 sets of 15 with 3-breath breaks.\n- Moderate: 3 sets of 25 with 5-breath breaks.\n- Aggressive: 2 sets of 37-38 with one 5-breath break.\n\n**Step 3: Practice the EXACT break strategy in training.**\nDo the strategy 2x per week for 4 weeks before race day. Your body and brain need to know exactly when breaks happen. On race day, execute the plan mechanically \u2014 don't think, just follow the count.\n\n**Break execution rules:**\n1. NEVER put the ball on the floor. Hold it at your chest or rest it on your thigh. Picking it up off the floor costs extra energy and time.\n2. Take exactly 3-5 breaths. Count them. Do NOT look at the clock or other athletes. Breathe, count, go.\n3. Start each set before you feel fully ready. If you wait until you feel ready, you're resting too long.\n\n**Why planned breaks beat unbroken attempts:**\nAn athlete who does 25-25-25-25 with 3-breath breaks finishes in about 5:30-6:00. An athlete who tries to go unbroken, makes it to 50, then falls apart and does 15-12-10-8-5 with long desperate breaks finishes in 7:00-8:00. The planned breaks save 1-2 minutes.\n\n**The math:** 3-breath breaks take ~5-6 seconds each. With 3 breaks in a 4-set strategy, you lose 15-18 seconds. But you maintain a consistent rep pace of 12-15 reps/min instead of crashing to 6-8 reps/min. Consistency wins."}]}

After that, it becomes a problem.\n\n**Why repeating works short-term (weeks 1-4):**\n- Your body hasn't adapted to the stimulus yet. Each session creates a meaningful training response.\n- You're learning the workout \u2014 pacing, transitions, break strategies. Repetition builds competence.\n- You have a clear benchmark: if your score improves week over week, the training is working.\n\n**Why repeating fails long-term (week 5+):**\n\n**1. Adaptation plateau.** Your body becomes efficient at that exact stimulus. It learns the minimum energy expenditure needed. AMRAP scores stop improving because you've adapted to those specific movements at those specific reps in that specific time domain.\n\n**2. Overuse injury risk.** The same movement patterns loaded the same way every week create repetitive stress on the same joints and tendons. Wall balls every week at the same volume = cumulative shoulder stress. KB swings every week = cumulative lower back loading.\n\n**3. Energy system imbalance.** Every workout has a primary energy system emphasis. If you only do a 20-minute AMRAP, you're training aerobic capacity but never glycolytic power or phosphagen speed. You develop blind spots.\n\n**4. Mental staleness.** Doing the same workout loses its challenge mentally. You stop pushing because you know exactly what's coming. Novel workouts force you to problem-solve under fatigue.\n\n**The solution \u2014 the benchmark + variation model:**\n- Keep your favorite workout as a monthly benchmark test. Do it on the same day, under the same conditions, once every 4 weeks. Track your score over time.\n- The other 3 weeks, use different workout formats (EMOM one week, intervals the next, For Time the next), different movements, and different time domains.\n\n**This gives you the best of both worlds:** consistent benchmarking (you can prove you're improving) plus stimulus variety (you keep adapting and avoid plateaus).\n\n**Rule of thumb:** No single workout should appear more than once every 3-4 weeks. Between appearances, change the format, movements, or time domain."}]}

Now you have strength work AND metabolic conditioning.\n\n**The key principle:** A main conditioning session needs 15+ minutes of effective work at an appropriate intensity. A single 4-min Tabata doesn't meet that threshold. But stacking multiple Tabatas or using modified formats (40:20) gets you there.\n\n**My recommendation:** Use Tabata as a finisher 2x per week and as a main session component (triple Tabata or heavy modified) 1x per week max. Don't make it your only conditioning format \u2014 you need longer-duration work (15-20 min AMRAPs, 20-min EMOMs) to build the aerobic capacity Hyrox demands."}]}

I want something that builds through the workout."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Progressive intervals are one of my favorite tools for teaching pacing under increasing demand. Each round strips away rest or adds volume, forcing you to manage fatigue in real-time \u2014 exactly like a Hyrox race where each station gets harder because you're more fatigued.\n\n**Progressive Descent Intervals \u2014 Row + Wall Ball:**\n\nRound 1: 2:00 work (250m Row + 10 Wall Balls) / 2:00 rest\nRound 2: 2:00 work (250m Row + 12 Wall Balls) / 1:45 rest\nRound 3: 2:00 work (250m Row + 14 Wall Balls) / 1:30 rest\nRound 4: 2:00 work (250m Row + 16 Wall Balls) / 1:15 rest\nRound 5: 2:00 work (250m Row + 18 Wall Balls) / 1:00 rest\nRound 6: 2:00 work (250m Row + max Wall Balls in remaining time) / Done\n\n**Total session time:** ~19 minutes.\n\n**RPE:** Starts at 6-7 in round 1, should reach 9 by round 5-6.\n\n**Why this structure:**\n- Work stays at 2:00 per round, but the wall ball volume increases (10 to 18). This means you need to row faster or the wall balls won't fit in the 2-minute window. The intensity escalates automatically.\n- Rest decreases from 2:00 to 1:00. Each round starts with less recovery. By round 5, you're working at 2:1 work-to-rest with 18 wall balls \u2014 that's brutal glycolytic territory.\n- Round 6 is the test: same 250m row, then max wall balls until the 2-minute mark. This round shows your capacity under accumulated fatigue.\n\n**Score:** Total wall balls across all 6 rounds. Typical intermediate: 75-90 total. Advanced: 90-110.\n\n**What this trains:** Progressive lactate accumulation and the ability to maintain output as conditions worsen. This is the exact Hyrox skill \u2014 station 1 feels manageable, station 8 feels impossible. This workout teaches you to keep performing as the difficulty escalates.\n\n**Scaling:**\n- Beginner: Start at 8 wall balls, increase by 1 per round. Rest starts at 2:30 and decreases by 15 sec.\n- Advanced: Start at 12 wall balls, increase by 3 per round. Rest starts at 1:30 and decreases by 15 sec."}]}
