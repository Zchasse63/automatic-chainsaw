I've seen coaches recommend both and I'm confused."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is one of the most genuinely debated technique points in Hyrox, and I want to be honest with you: there is no single \"correct\" answer. Both positions have legitimate biomechanical arguments. Let me present both fairly so you can make an informed choice.\n\n**Extended / Locked-Out Arms:**\n- Maximizes **force transfer through a rigid kinetic chain**. When your arms are straight, your skeletal structure transmits force from your legs directly into the sled with minimal energy loss.\n- Preferred by many **elite athletes** for heavy sled work (like Men's Open at 152kg or Pro at 202kg). The heavier the sled, the more a rigid kinetic chain matters.\n- Creates a longer lever arm, which allows you to maintain a lower body angle \u2014 and body angle is the single most important variable on sled push.\n- **Downside:** Puts more load on the shoulder joint and can fatigue deltoids over 50m if shoulder stability is a weakness.\n\n**Bent Arms (90-120 degrees):**\n- Allows the arms to act as **shock absorbers**, which can improve control especially on the turns (4 x 12.5m format).\n- Recruits the triceps and chest more actively, which some athletes find helps them \"push through\" sticking points.\n- Provides better **fine motor control** for steering on lighter sleds (Women's Open at 102kg).\n- **Downside:** Energy \"leaks\" through the elbow joint \u2014 the muscles must actively maintain the bend, costing metabolic energy over 50m.\n\n**My Recommendation:**\nTry both in training over 2-3 sessions and **time yourself.** Whatever moves YOUR sled fastest across 50m on a consistent basis is the right answer for you. Individual limb proportions, shoulder mobility, and relative strength all influence which position works better for a given athlete.\n\n**General guidelines:**\n- Heavier sled (Men's Open/Pro): Extended arms tend to perform better\n- Lighter sled (Women's Open): Either works; bent arms give more control\n- Shoulder issues: Slight bend (not full lockout) reduces joint stress\n\n**What IS non-negotiable regardless of arm position:**\n- **Body angle at 45 degrees or lower** \u2014 this matters 10x more than arm position\n- **Short, rapid steps** (6-8 inches, 120+ SPM)\n- **Drive from your legs**, not your arms \u2014 your arms are connectors, not engines\n- **Head down**, eyes on the ground 6 feet ahead\n\nDon't let anyone tell you one arm position is categorically \"wrong.\" The biomechanics support both approaches depending on the athlete and the load."}]}

I feel like I'm too upright."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you feel too upright, you almost certainly are \u2014 and it's costing you significant time. Body angle is the **single most important technique variable** on sled push. Let me give you the mechanics.\n\n**The Target: 45 Degrees or Lower**\n\nImagine a line from your shoulders to your ankles. That line should form a **45-degree angle or less** with the ground. Think of a sprinter in the first 10 meters out of the blocks \u2014 that's the body position you want to maintain for the entire 50m push.\n\n**Why 45 Degrees Matters \u2014 The Physics:**\n- At 45 degrees, roughly **70% of your force** goes horizontally (moving the sled forward) and 30% goes vertically (into the ground).\n- At 60 degrees (too upright), only about **50% of your force** goes forward \u2014 the rest pushes the sled INTO the carpet, creating MORE friction. You're literally making the sled harder to push by standing too tall.\n- At 30 degrees (very aggressive lean), nearly **87% of your force** goes forward. This is ideal but requires significant core strength to maintain.\n\n**How to Achieve and Hold the Angle:**\n\n1. **Set your position BEFORE the first step.** Walk up to the sled, place your hands, then drop your hips and lean in. Be at 45 degrees before you take step one. The first 3 steps are the hardest because you're breaking static friction \u2014 you need maximum mechanical advantage from the start.\n\n2. **Head position drives body angle.** Look at the ground about **6 feet ahead** of you, NOT forward at the end of the lane. The moment you look up, your chest rises, your angle opens, and you lose power. Head down, eyes down.\n\n3. **Hips below shoulders.** This is the key cue. If your hips are at the same height or higher than your shoulders, you're too upright.\n\n4. **Drive through the balls of your feet,** not your toes and not your heels. Ball of the foot gives you the optimal power transfer into the ground.\n\n**The Turn Problem:**\nThe 50m is done as 4 x 12.5m with 180-degree turns. Most athletes stand up at the turns and lose their angle. **Fix:** As you approach the turn, maintain your low position, reposition your hands quickly, and immediately reset to 45 degrees before driving again. The turn should take under 3 seconds.\n\n**Training drill:** Film yourself from the side during sled push training. You'll be shocked \u2014 almost every athlete thinks they're lower than they are. Use the video to correct in real time. Place a piece of tape on the wall at your 45-degree shoulder height as a visual reference."}]}

And how do I brace properly?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hand-over-hand is the standard and most efficient method for the 50m Hyrox sled pull. Big sweeping arm pulls are less efficient because they create a stop-start pattern where the sled decelerates between pulls. Let me break down the full technique.\n\n**The Hand-Over-Hand Method:**\n\n**Step 1: Establish Your Base (This Is Where Most Athletes Fail)**\nBefore you pull a single inch of rope, you need a rock-solid base. Here's how:\n- **Sit back** with your hips low, like the bottom of a squat or a rowing catch position\n- **Brace your feet** against the ground, the base of the sled lane, or any available foothold. Many Hyrox setups have a small lip or bar at the front of the pulling station \u2014 use it\n- Your feet are your anchor. If your feet slip, every pull moves YOU toward the sled instead of the sled toward you. **Brace first, then pull.**\n\n**Step 2: The Pull Rhythm**\n- Grab the rope with both hands, one above the other\n- **Short, rapid hand-over-hand pulls** \u2014 about 12-18 inches per pull\n- Keep the rope taut between pulls. If you let slack develop, you waste energy re-tensioning\n- **Use your entire posterior chain**, not just your biceps. Lean back slightly and drive with your back and hips as you pull\n\n**Step 3: Rope Management**\n- As rope accumulates behind you, let it fall to ONE side (choose your dominant side)\n- Don't let it pile between your legs \u2014 you'll trip or it'll tangle\n- Keep your pulling hands in front of your chest, not reaching overhead\n\n**The Bracing Technique in Detail:**\n- Core tight \u2014 think \"anti-extension.\" Your body wants to fold forward under the pull. Resist it.\n- Exhale with each pull to maintain intra-abdominal pressure\n- Reset your foot brace every 10-15 pulls if you feel yourself sliding forward\n- **The moment your base fails, stop and rebrace.** A 3-second reset is better than 20 seconds of inefficient pulling from a compromised position.\n\n**Key Principle: Keep the Sled Moving**\nStatic friction (sled at rest) is MUCH higher than kinetic friction (sled in motion). Every time the sled stops completely, it takes significantly more force to restart it. Your pull cadence should be fast enough that the sled maintains continuous forward momentum \u2014 even if each individual pull is small.\n\n**Use chalk.** Your hands will be sweaty from three prior stations and a run. Chalk is permitted and it transforms your grip. Apply it to both palms before the station starts."}]}

I've been told different numbers."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let me clear this up definitively. The optimal SkiErg stroke rate for Hyrox race pace is **28-35 strokes per minute (SPM)**. Here's the breakdown by athlete level and why going above this range is counterproductive.\n\n**Stroke Rate Targets by Level:**\n\n| Level | SPM Range | Focus |\n|---|---|---|\n| Beginner | 25-30 SPM | Power per stroke. Long, controlled pulls. Learning the hip hinge. |\n| Intermediate | 30-35 SPM | Balanced power and tempo. This is the sweet spot for most Hyrox athletes. |\n| Advanced/Elite | 32-36 SPM | High power maintained at moderate tempo. Efficiency is king. |\n\n**The Efficient Zone: 30-34 SPM**\nFor most Hyrox athletes, the optimal cadence is right around **30-34 SPM**. This allows you to:\n- Generate high power per stroke using the lat and hip hinge pattern\n- Maintain a sustainable cardiovascular demand over 1000m\n- Complete the recovery phase fully (which is your micro-rest each stroke)\n\n**Why Going Above 38-40 SPM is Counterproductive:**\nWhen you push past 38-40 SPM, several things break down:\n1. **Power per stroke drops dramatically.** You physically cannot complete a full hip hinge and lat pull at that speed. You end up shortening the range of motion and pulling with arms only \u2014 small muscles that fatigue in under 2 minutes.\n2. **The recovery disappears.** At 40+ SPM, there's no time for a controlled recovery. You lose your micro-rest, and heart rate spikes unnecessarily.\n3. **Metabolic cost increases disproportionately.** You're moving faster but NOT generating proportionally more power. The result is higher heart rate, faster fatigue, and a slower overall 1000m time.\n\n**The Math That Proves It:**\n- Athlete A: 32 SPM with strong power per stroke = **1:50/500m split** = 3:40 total\n- Athlete B: 42 SPM with weak power per stroke = **2:05/500m split** = 4:10 total\n- Athlete B works harder, has a higher heart rate, AND finishes 30 seconds slower.\n\n**Practical Application:**\n- **First 300m:** 28-30 SPM. Settling in from Run 1, establishing rhythm and breathing.\n- **300-700m:** 30-34 SPM. Race pace. Controlled, powerful strokes.\n- **700-1000m:** 32-36 SPM. Push slightly as you approach the finish.\n\n**Training drill:** Set the SkiErg monitor to show strokes per minute. Do 5 x 250m intervals at your target SPM range. If you drift above 35, force yourself to slow down and add power. Quality over quantity on every single stroke."}]}

I need to cover 80 meters and I'm dreading it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BBJ is the most systemically fatiguing station in Hyrox. Most athletes need 40-55 reps to cover 80 meters. The good news: technique and pacing improvements can save 60-90 seconds without any fitness change. Here's the efficient method.\n\n**The Burpee Phase \u2014 Step-Back, Not Jump-Back:**\n\n1. **Lower to the ground:** From standing, place your hands down and **step back one leg at a time** (not jump back). Stepping back costs about 0.5 seconds more per rep than jumping back, but saves an enormous amount of energy over 40-55 reps. The jump-back method spikes your heart rate significantly and is unsustainable over 80m for all but elite athletes.\n2. **Chest touches the floor.** This is mandatory \u2014 you'll get no-repped if your chest doesn't make contact. Don't resist the descent \u2014 let gravity help you down and save your arms.\n3. **Get up using the step-up method:** Plant one foot (your dominant foot) close to your hands, push off that leg to stand. This is what most elite athletes use. It keeps heart rate lower and is biomechanically easier on fatigued legs than the explosive jump-up.\n\n**The Broad Jump Phase \u2014 Forward, Not Up:**\n\n1. **Explosive jump forward** with a coordinated arm swing. Your arms generate roughly 10-15% of your jump distance \u2014 use them aggressively.\n2. **Think \"long jump\" not \"high jump.\"** Every inch of vertical height is wasted energy. You want a **low, flat trajectory** that maximizes forward distance.\n3. **Target 60-70% of your max jump distance.** If you can broad jump 2.5m fresh, aim for **1.5-1.8m per rep** in the race. This means you'll need roughly 45-53 reps instead of 35-40, but each rep costs dramatically less energy. Athletes who jump at 90%+ max burn out by the halfway point and end up resting.\n4. **Land soft with bent knees.** Absorb the landing \u2014 don't slam into the ground with straight legs. A soft landing transitions smoothly into the next rep.\n\n**Rhythm Is Everything:**\n- Establish your tempo within the first 3 reps and hold it for 80 meters\n- Each rep should take roughly the same amount of time: 5-7 seconds for intermediate athletes, 3-5 seconds for advanced\n- If you need to rest, rest **lying chest-down on the floor**, not standing. Heart rate drops faster in a horizontal position. Take 3-5 breaths and resume.\n\n**Foot Rules:**\n- Feet must be **parallel** on takeoff and landing \u2014 no staggered stance\n- Hands placed no more than **30cm in front of your feet** before the burpee\n- Landing: both feet together, don't take extra steps forward after landing\n\n**Mental Game:**\nCount DOWN, not up. \"Only 20 more\" beats \"I've done 30.\" Break the 80m into mental segments \u2014 two 40m halves, or four 20m quarters. Give yourself a tiny mental celebration at each checkpoint."}]}

I feel like I'm suffocating by rep 30."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you're suffocating by rep 30, your breathing is almost certainly unstructured \u2014 you're holding your breath on some reps, double-breathing on others, and it cascades into oxygen debt fast. Let me give you the pattern that works.\n\n**The Wall Ball Breathing Pattern:**\n\n**Exhale on the push/throw.** As you drive up from the squat and release the ball, exhale forcefully. This is the exertion phase \u2014 forced expiration helps maintain intra-abdominal pressure and stabilizes your core under the squat-to-throw movement.\n\n**Inhale on the catch/squat.** As the ball descends and you catch it while beginning your squat, inhale. The eccentric phase (lowering into the squat) is your micro-recovery \u2014 use it.\n\n**One breath per rep.** That's the goal. One full breath cycle (exhale + inhale) for every single wall ball rep. At a rate of 15-20 reps per minute, that's 15-20 breaths per minute \u2014 a sustainable respiratory rate for moderate exertion.\n\n**Why This Matters Physiologically:**\n- Holding your breath (even for 2-3 reps) triggers a Valsalva response that spikes blood pressure and heart rate. Over 100 reps, this accumulates into significant cardiovascular stress.\n- Unstructured breathing leads to shallow chest breathing instead of diaphragmatic breathing. Shallow breathing means less O2 per breath, more breaths needed, more respiratory muscle fatigue.\n- A rhythmic breathing pattern creates a **metronome effect** that actually helps pace your reps. Your body locks into the breathe-squat-throw-catch rhythm and it becomes automatic.\n\n**How to Establish the Pattern:**\n1. **First 5 reps:** Deliberately exaggerate the exhale on each throw. Audible, forceful exhale. This sets the pattern.\n2. **Reps 5-20:** The rhythm should feel natural now. Don't think about it \u2014 just maintain.\n3. **When breaking for rest:** Take **3 deep, slow breaths** \u2014 inhale through nose for 3 counts, exhale through mouth for 5 counts. This activates your parasympathetic nervous system and brings heart rate down faster than rapid panting.\n4. **Resuming after a break:** First rep back, exaggerate the exhale again to re-establish the rhythm.\n\n**The Break Breathing Protocol:**\nWhen you set the ball down for a rest:\n- Breath 1: Deep inhale through nose, slow exhale through mouth\n- Breath 2: Same pattern \u2014 you should feel your heart rate start to settle\n- Breath 3: One more deep breath, then pick up and go\n\nThat's 5-8 seconds. More than 3 recovery breaths means you pushed too hard in the previous set \u2014 make your next set shorter.\n\n**Training drill:** During your next wall ball session, count your breaths instead of your reps. One breath per rep. If you find yourself holding your breath, stop the set, take 3 recovery breaths, and restart with the conscious exhale pattern."}]}

I feel like I'm holding my breath the whole time and I'm dizzy after."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Dizziness after sled push is a classic sign of breath-holding under maximal exertion. The sled push is one of the highest-intensity stations \u2014 it's essentially a 30-120 second all-out effort \u2014 and athletes instinctively hold their breath because it feels like it creates more power. It does, briefly, but then you crash hard. Here's the fix.\n\n**Sled Push Breathing Pattern:**\n\n**Short, forceful exhales with every step.** Not full breaths \u2014 short, sharp exhalations timed to your foot strikes. Think of a boxer throwing rapid punches \u2014 each punch gets a short \"tss\" exhale. Same principle here.\n\n**The rhythm:** Step-exhale, step-exhale, step-exhale. Every time your foot hits the ground and you drive, exhale sharply. The inhale happens naturally between steps \u2014 you don't need to think about it.\n\n**Why This Works:**\n1. **Maintains intra-abdominal pressure** without the Valsalva response. A forceful exhale against a braced core creates the pressure you need for power production without the blood pressure spike of full breath-holding.\n2. **Prevents the \"breath-hold-crash\" pattern.** When you hold your breath for 5-10 steps, CO2 builds rapidly. When you finally exhale, your body overcorrects \u2014 blood pressure drops, you get dizzy, and power output collapses. This is exactly what you're experiencing.\n3. **Keeps your respiratory muscles active.** During a 30-120 second max effort, your respiratory muscles (diaphragm, intercostals) need to work continuously. Holding your breath shuts them down and they \"cold start\" when you resume \u2014 causing that gasping, dizzy feeling.\n\n**The Practical Protocol:**\n- **Steps 1-10:** Establish the step-exhale pattern. Exaggerate it. Loud, forceful exhalations.\n- **Steps 10-halfway:** Maintain the pattern. Your body will want to hold breath \u2014 resist it.\n- **Turns:** Take 2-3 deeper breaths at each turn while repositioning. This is your only real breathing window.\n- **Final 12.5m push:** The pattern may break down here as effort goes truly maximal. That's OK for the last 10-15 seconds \u2014 but not before.\n\n**Training drill:** Practice sled pushes at 60% race weight focusing ONLY on the breathing pattern. Don't care about your time \u2014 just lock in the step-exhale rhythm. Then gradually increase weight while maintaining the pattern. It takes 3-4 sessions to make it automatic.\n\n**Race-day tip:** The run immediately after sled push is critical. Your breathing will be chaotic. First 200m of Run 3, focus exclusively on getting to a controlled inhale-exhale running pattern. The pace will come \u2014 get the breathing right first."}]}

I usually set it to 10 because I want maximum resistance."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Stop setting it to 10. This is one of the most common misconceptions in rowing and it's costing you time and energy. The damper is NOT a \"resistance\" dial \u2014 it controls **airflow to the flywheel**, which changes the feel of each stroke but not necessarily the difficulty. Higher damper does NOT equal a harder or better workout. Let me explain.\n\n**What the Damper Actually Does:**\n- **Low damper (1-3):** Less air enters the flywheel. Each stroke feels lighter and quicker. Rewards technique and stroke rate.\n- **Medium damper (4-7):** Moderate airflow. Balanced feel. Most athletes produce their best average watts here.\n- **High damper (8-10):** Maximum airflow. Each stroke feels heavy and slow \u2014 like rowing through mud. Heavily taxes the legs and back.\n\n**Why Damper 10 Hurts You in Hyrox:**\n1. **Muscular fatigue:** At damper 10, each stroke requires significantly more force from your legs and back. After 5 runs and 4 stations, your legs are already fatigued. Damper 10 accelerates that fatigue for the remaining stations (farmer carry, lunges, wall balls).\n2. **Lower stroke rate:** The heavy flywheel resistance naturally slows your stroke rate. Most athletes at damper 10 drop to 20-22 SPM, which often produces SLOWER split times than 26-28 SPM at damper 5-6.\n3. **Energy cost is disproportionate:** The extra force per stroke at damper 10 doesn't proportionally improve your split time. You might pull 5 watts more per stroke but burn 15% more energy doing it.\n\n**Recommended Damper Settings for Hyrox:**\n\n| Athlete Size | Damper Setting | Drag Factor |\n|---|---|---|\n| Lighter athletes (<75kg / 165lbs) | 4-5 | ~110-125 |\n| Medium athletes (75-90kg / 165-200lbs) | 5-6 | ~125-145 |\n| Heavier athletes (>90kg / 200lbs) | 6-7 | ~135-155 |\n\n**Note:** Some Hyrox events preset the damper by division. If it's preset, you work with what you're given. If adjustable, use the ranges above.\n\n**The Real Performance Lever \u2014 Drag Factor:**\nDrag factor is the actual measure of resistance, and it varies between machines even at the same damper setting. If you train on a Concept2, check your drag factor in the settings menu and find the damper setting that gives you ~130-145 for most male athletes. Then on race day, adjust the damper to match that drag factor on the specific machine.\n\n**Pacing at the Right Damper:**\nAt damper 5-6, target these splits for intermediate male athletes:\n- **1:45-2:00/500m** \u2014 sustainable race pace\n- **24-28 SPM** \u2014 optimal stroke rate for this damper range\n- Negative split the 1000m \u2014 first 500m at 1:55-2:00, second 500m at 1:45-1:55\n\nTrust me on this \u2014 dropping from damper 10 to 5-6 will feel \"too easy\" for the first few sessions. Then you'll notice your splits are the same or faster, your heart rate is lower, and your legs feel fresher for the rest of the race. That's the win."}]}

And should I plan for breaks?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Grip failure on farmer carry is almost never just a grip problem \u2014 it's usually a combination of accumulated fatigue from prior stations (especially sled pull), poor shoulder posture, and a grip strategy that starts too aggressive. Let me fix all three.\n\n**Grip Technique:**\n\n1. **Use chalk if permitted.** This is non-negotiable. Sweaty hands after 6 runs and 5 stations make the kettlebell handles slippery. Chalk alone can add 30-50m to your unbroken carry distance.\n\n2. **Full hand wrap, not fingertip grip.** Get the handle deep into your palm, wrap all four fingers completely around, and lock your thumb over your index finger. A fingertip grip engages the small finger flexors that fatigue quickly. A full palm grip distributes the load across the entire hand.\n\n3. **Grip tight from the start \u2014 but not maximum.** Start at about **70-80% of your max squeeze.** This sounds counterintuitive \u2014 shouldn't you save grip for later? No. If you start too loose, the kettlebells shift and bounce, which creates unpredictable loads that spike forearm fatigue. A firm initial grip keeps the bells stable and reduces the total grip work over 200m. Gradually increase squeeze as fatigue builds \u2014 you're ramping from 70% to 100% rather than starting at 100% with nowhere to go.\n\n4. **Shoulders packed.** Pull your shoulders down and back \u2014 retracted and depressed. This is critical because when your shoulders round forward and elevate (shrugging), the kettlebells hang in a biomechanically disadvantaged position and grip fatigue accelerates exponentially. Dr. Adam Storey calls this a \"postural endurance test\" more than a grip test.\n\n**Break Strategy:**\n\nFor Men's Open (2x24kg), here's what I recommend based on your carry capacity:\n\n| Carry Capacity | Strategy |\n|---|---|\n| Can carry 200m unbroken in training | Go unbroken on race day. You have a margin. |\n| Can carry 150-200m in training | Plan ONE break at 100m. Brief 3-5 second reset \u2014 set down, shake hands, re-chalk if available, pick up. |\n| Can carry 100-150m in training | Plan TWO breaks at ~70m and ~140m. Same 3-5 second protocol. |\n| Under 100m in training | Three planned breaks at 50m intervals. Priority is building carry capacity in training. |\n\n**The Break Protocol (When You Do Stop):**\n- Set kettlebells down deliberately \u2014 don't drop them\n- Shake your hands vigorously for 2-3 seconds\n- Re-apply chalk if you have it\n- Take 1-2 breaths\n- Pick up and GO. Total break: **3-5 seconds maximum**\n\n**Critical principle:** A planned 5-second break at the halfway mark is FAR better than carrying to grip failure at 160m and then needing a 20-30 second recovery. If you feel your grip moving from \"manageable\" to \"about to fail,\" set down IMMEDIATELY. Don't push to failure.\n\n**Downstream consideration:** After farmer carry, you still have sandbag lunges (where dropping the bag = 5-second penalty, second drop = DQ) and 100 wall balls. Manage grip fatigue as a resource that must last through three more tasks, not just this one."}]}

This station crushes me and I can barely run afterward."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you can barely run after lunges, you're almost certainly doing them in a quad-dominant pattern with short steps. This is the most common mistake on this station, and it has a devastating downstream effect on wall balls and Run 8. Let me rebuild your approach.\n\n**Sandbag Position \u2014 High and Tight:**\n- **Bear hug the bag** \u2014 wrap both arms around it, clasping your hands or gripping your forearms\n- Keep the bag **HIGH on your chest**, almost at collarbone level. If the bag slides down to your belly, your center of gravity shifts forward and every step costs more energy. Plus the bag becomes harder to hold.\n- Maintain an **upright torso**. The moment your trunk folds forward under the weight, metabolic cost skyrockets and the bag starts sliding.\n\n**Step Length \u2014 This Is the Game-Changer:**\nTarget **0.9-1.1 meters per step.** For 100m, that's roughly **90-110 total steps.**\n\nWhy this range specifically:\n- **Short steps (0.7m or less, 140+ total steps):** These are quad-dominant by biomechanical necessity. Short steps keep your shin vertical, which loads the quadriceps almost exclusively. After 140 quad-dominant reps, your quads are shredded and wall balls become a nightmare. HyroxDataLab found athletes with short-step lunges averaged **75 seconds slower on wall balls.**\n- **The right step length (0.9-1.1m):** Allows your shin to angle forward slightly and your torso to maintain a slight forward lean, which recruits your **glutes and hamstrings** to share the load. This distributes fatigue across your entire lower body instead of concentrating it in your quads.\n- **Too-long steps (1.2m+):** Create balance problems, especially with a sandbag shifting on your chest, and slow your tempo.\n\n**Pacing: Continuous Touch-and-Go**\n- Rear knee touches the ground, immediately drive up into the next step\n- No standing pauses between reps. Every 1-second pause adds up to ~100 seconds of wasted time over 100+ steps\n- Set a **metronome-like rhythm** within the first 3-4 steps and hold it for the entire 100m\n- **RPE target: 7-8/10.** This station should feel hard but sustainable. If you're at RPE 9-10, shorten your steps slightly \u2014 you're overreaching.\n\n**The Downstream Effect \u2014 Why This Matters:**\nThis station sits at position 7 of 8. After lunges, you face:\n- **Run 8:** Often the slowest run of the race. If your quads are destroyed from short-step lunges, you might walk significant portions.\n- **Wall Balls (100 reps):** A quad-dominant station. If your quads are already cooked, your wall ball time will balloon by 60-90 seconds.\n\nThink of lunges and wall balls as a **combined station.** A slightly slower lunge time with posterior chain emphasis that saves you 60+ seconds on wall balls is a net win every time.\n\n**The Penalty Reminder:**\n- First sandbag drop: **5-second penalty**\n- Second drop: **Disqualification**\n- Secure your grip before starting. If you feel the bag slipping, stop lunging momentarily and reposition. A 2-second adjustment beats a 5-second penalty or a DQ."}]}

Is he right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your buddy is giving you one perspective, but he's wrong to call straight arms a \"mistake.\" This is one of the most debated technique points in Hyrox, and the honest answer is that BOTH arm positions have legitimate use cases.\n\n**What your buddy is right about:**\n- Bent arms do engage the chest and triceps more, which some athletes find helpful\n- Bent arms provide better control, especially on turns\n- For lighter sled weights, bent arms work fine\n\n**Where your buddy is wrong:**\n- Calling extended arms a \"mistake\" is incorrect. Many elite athletes \u2014 including several top Pro competitors \u2014 push with extended or nearly locked-out arms, especially at heavier sled weights\n- Extended arms create a **rigid kinetic chain** that transmits leg power directly to the sled with minimal energy loss through the joints\n- At Men's Open weight (152kg) or Pro weight (202kg), the rigid kinetic chain argument becomes very strong because the force requirements are high\n\n**The real answer:**\nNeither position is categorically right or wrong. The variables that matter are:\n1. Your sled weight (heavier = extended arms tend to win)\n2. Your individual proportions and strengths\n3. What actually moves the sled fastest for YOU\n\nCan you tell me what weight you're pushing and what your current sled push time is? That will help me give you a more specific recommendation."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I'm doing Men's Open so 152kg sled.

Here's my recommendation for YOU specifically.\n\nAt Men's Open weight, I'd suggest trying **extended or nearly-extended arms** in your next training session. Here's why:\n\n**For 152kg sleds specifically:**\n- The force required to move 152kg on competition carpet is substantial. At this weight, you need maximum force transfer from your legs to the sled.\n- Extended arms create a rigid skeletal bridge \u2014 force travels from your legs, through your braced core, through locked-out arms, directly into the sled. No energy leaks through an actively-maintained elbow bend.\n- Your chest and triceps are relatively small muscles. At 152kg, they'll fatigue well before your legs do. With bent arms, those muscles become the limiting factor \u2014 not your legs.\n\n**The test:**\nNext training session, do 4 x 12.5m at race weight:\n- Sets 1-2: Bent arms (your buddy's method)\n- Sets 3-4: Extended arms\n\nTime each set and note which felt more powerful and sustainable. Also film yourself from the side \u2014 check your body angle in each position.\n\n**What I predict you'll find:**\nMost athletes at 152kg find that extended arms allow them to maintain a lower body angle (closer to 45 degrees) because the rigid arm position creates a longer lever. Lower body angle = more horizontal force = faster sled.\n\n**However \u2014 the non-negotiables regardless of arm position:**\n- Body angle at **45 degrees or lower** (this matters 10x more than arm choice)\n- Short, rapid steps (**120+ steps per minute**)\n- Head down, eyes on the ground 6 feet ahead\n- Driving from your LEGS, not your arms\n\nFix those four things and you'll drop from 3:45 to sub-3:15 regardless of which arm position you choose. The arm position debate is about the last 10-15 seconds of optimization \u2014 body angle and step cadence are about the first 30-45 seconds of improvement."}]}

I know it feels counterintuitive \u2014 more strokes should mean more distance, right? But on the SkiErg, there's a point of diminishing returns, and you're well past it. Let me explain the physics and give you the fix.\n\n**Why 40+ SPM is Hurting Your Time:**\n\nAt 40+ SPM, you physically cannot complete a full range of motion on each stroke. Here's what happens:\n\n1. **Shortened pull:** You're initiating the next stroke before completing the current one. The hip hinge \u2014 which is where 60-70% of your power comes from \u2014 gets cut short. You end up pulling with arms only.\n2. **No recovery:** Each stroke has a power phase (the pull) and a recovery phase (arms returning to the top). The recovery is your micro-rest. At 40+ SPM, the recovery disappears \u2014 you're working continuously with no rest, and your heart rate skyrockets.\n3. **Less power per stroke:** You might be doing 25% more strokes per minute, but each stroke produces 40-50% less power. The net result is LESS total output at a HIGHER metabolic cost.\n\n**The Fix \u2014 Drop to 30-34 SPM:**\n\nHere's what I want you to do:\n- **Session 1:** 4 x 250m at 30 SPM. Use the monitor to check. Focus on: full hip hinge to 45 degrees, pull with lats not arms, complete recovery at the top.\n- **Session 2:** 4 x 250m at 32 SPM. Same technique focus. Check your average watts \u2014 I predict they'll be HIGHER than your 40+ SPM watts.\n- **Session 3:** 2 x 500m at 32-34 SPM. Check your 500m split time.\n\n**What you should see:**\n- Split times improve by **5-15 seconds per 500m** within 2-3 sessions\n- Heart rate is noticeably lower at the same or better output\n- You feel less panicked and more controlled\n- Your lat and core engagement increases dramatically\n\n**The targets for your 1000m:**\nAt 32-34 SPM with full power strokes, a 4:00-4:15 finish is realistic \u2014 that's a **15-30 second improvement** from a technique change alone. With continued training at the correct cadence, sub-4:00 is absolutely achievable.\n\n**Breathing at the Correct Rate:**\nAt 30-34 SPM, you can easily sync one full breath per stroke:\n- **Exhale** on the pull (as you hinge down)\n- **Inhale** on the recovery (as you stand up)\n- This rhythmic breathing is impossible at 40+ SPM \u2014 there's no time for it\n\nThe biggest mental hurdle is that 30-34 SPM will feel \"too slow\" compared to what you're used to. Push through that feeling. Watch the power output on the monitor \u2014 when you see higher watts at a lower stroke rate, you'll be convinced."}]}

I can do 3:30 fresh but I pulled 4:45 after the BBJ station. That's a huge drop-off. How do I fix this?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A 75-second deterioration from fresh to post-BBJ is actually within the expected range \u2014 but it IS on the high side. Most competitive athletes see a **10-20% drop** from fresh to in-race times. Your fresh 3:30 would predict an in-race time of about 3:50-4:12. At 4:45, you're dropping 36% \u2014 which tells me it's not just fatigue, it's a technique breakdown under fatigue. Let me diagnose.\n\n**The Three Most Likely Causes of Your 75-Second Drop:**\n\n**1. Arms-First Pulling Under Fatigue (Most Likely)**\nWhen you're gassed from BBJ, your body defaults to pulling with arms because it's the \"easiest\" path. But arms-only rowing produces a fraction of the power of proper legs-back-arms sequencing. Under fatigue, you need to CONSCIOUSLY force the leg drive. Cue yourself: \"Legs. Back. Arms.\" Say it out loud for the first 10 strokes.\n\n**2. Rushing the Recovery**\nPost-BBJ, your heart rate is screaming. The instinct is to rush \u2014 faster strokes, faster recovery. But rushing the recovery eliminates your micro-rest and keeps heart rate elevated. The fix: slow the recovery to a 2:1 ratio (recovery twice as long as the drive). The first 200-250m should be deliberate recovery \u2014 you'll be faster overall.\n\n**3. Death-Gripping the Handle**\nAfter BBJ, your forearms are already taxed. Then you grab the rowing handle and squeeze like your life depends on it. This accelerates grip fatigue and sends tension up your entire arm chain. Fix: loose hook grip. Fingers draped over the handle.\n\nTell me \u2014 what was your stroke rate during that 4:45 row? And did you feel like the power per stroke was weak, or like you just couldn't maintain your cadence?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "My stroke rate was around 32 SPM which is normal for me. But each stroke felt weak, like I couldn't get any power. My legs just felt dead from the burpees."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "32 SPM with dead legs and weak power \u2014 that confirms my suspicion. Your stroke rate is fine, but your power per stroke is collapsing because your legs are fried from BBJ. This is a very specific and fixable problem. Here's the two-part solution.\n\n**Part 1: Tactical Use of the Row as Recovery**\n\nThe row is the only station in Hyrox where you SIT DOWN. Smart athletes use the first 200-250m as active recovery from BBJ rather than trying to immediately hammer the pace.\n\n**Your new pacing plan for the in-race row:**\n\n| Segment | Split | Effort | Purpose |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 0-250m | 2:05-2:15/500m | 65-70% | **Active recovery.** Let heart rate drop. Focus on controlled breathing and technique. DO NOT chase a fast split here. |\n| 250-500m | 1:55-2:05/500m | 75-80% | Legs starting to respond. Gradually increase leg drive. |\n| 500-750m | 1:50-1:55/500m | 85% | Building. You should feel your legs coming back online. |\n| 750-1000m | 1:45-1:50/500m | 90%+ | Push to finish. This is where you make up time. |\n\nThis negative split approach will likely produce a **4:00-4:15 total** instead of your 4:45 \u2014 because you preserved energy in the first 250m and let your legs recover before asking them to work hard.\n\n**Part 2: Train the BBJ-to-Row Transition Specifically**\n\nYour body needs to learn how to produce rowing power on fatigued legs. This is a trainable adaptation. Here's the workout:\n\n**The \"BBJ-Row Transition Drill\" \u2014 Do this once per week:**\n- 40m BBJ at race pace \u2192 immediately sit on rower \u2192 500m row at target split\n- Rest 3 minutes\n- Repeat 3-4 times\n\n**Week 1-2:** Target row split of 2:00/500m after the BBJ\n**Week 3-4:** Target 1:55/500m\n**Week 5-6:** Target 1:50/500m\n\n**The physiological adaptation you're building:** Your body learns to redirect blood flow from the muscles BBJ hammered (hip flexors, shoulders, cardio system) to the muscles rowing demands (legs, lats, core). This cardiovascular \"switching\" is a trainable skill. After 4-6 sessions, you'll notice the row feels dramatically less terrible post-BBJ.\n\n**Also consider this strategic insight from Rox Lyfe:** Going 15-20 seconds slower than your absolute max 1000m row saves enormous energy and costs only seconds in a 70-80 minute race \u2014 but likely saves you minutes across farmer carry, lunges, and wall balls. A 4:00 row that leaves your legs fresh for the final three stations beats a 3:45 row that destroys them."}]}

Which stations will feel familiar and which do I need to worry about?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As a CrossFitter, you have a significant advantage on several stations \u2014 but there are also some Hyrox-specific traps that catch CrossFit athletes constantly. Let me break it down station by station.\n\n**Stations Where Your CrossFit Background Helps:**\n\n**Wall Balls \u2014 Your Biggest Advantage**\nYou've probably done thousands of wall balls. You know the squat depth, the catch-and-squat rhythm, the breathing pattern. Just be aware: in Hyrox, you're doing wall balls after 7 runs, 7 stations, and 100m of sandbag lunges. Your fresh capacity matters less than your fatigued capacity. Still, this is where you'll shine relative to non-CrossFit athletes.\n\n**Rowing \u2014 Strong Overlap**\nIf you've done serious CrossFit, your rowing mechanics are probably solid. The key difference: Hyrox rowing comes after BBJ, so it's about managing the fatigue transition. Use the row as tactical recovery \u2014 don't sprint it like a CrossFit workout. Target 24-28 SPM with strong leg drive. Damper at 5-6 for your weight class.\n\n**Burpee Broad Jumps \u2014 Partial Overlap**\nYou know burpees, but Hyrox BBJ is different from CrossFit burpees. Key differences:\n- The BROAD JUMP component is the differentiator. Jump forward (60-70% max distance), not up.\n- It's 80 meters of continuous work, not a set number of reps in a WOD. Pacing discipline matters more than speed.\n- Step-up method is recommended even for fit athletes \u2014 save your heart rate for 80m of sustained work.\n\n**Stations Where You Need to Adjust:**\n\n**SkiErg \u2014 Moderate Concern**\nCrossFit uses the SkiErg but often in short bursts. In Hyrox it's 1000m and it's Station 1 \u2014 you can't redline it. Target 30-34 SPM with lat-dominant pulls. Resist the CrossFit instinct to go all-out.\n\n**Sled Push \u2014 Technique Warning**\nCrossFit athletes tend to push sleds with bent arms and an upright posture because gym sleds are often lighter. Hyrox sleds at 152kg (Men's Open) on competition carpet feel MUCH heavier. You need a **45-degree body angle** and short rapid steps (120+ SPM). Film yourself \u2014 you're probably more upright than you think.\n\n**Sled Pull \u2014 Major Adjustment Needed**\nCrossFit rarely programs hand-over-hand sled pulls in a confined space with rope management. This is unfamiliar territory. Key technique: brace your feet FIRST, then pull hand-over-hand with hip extension. Keep the sled moving \u2014 static friction is your enemy.\n\n**Farmer Carry \u2014 Different Context**\nIn CrossFit, farmer carries are usually short and heavy. Hyrox is 200m at moderate weight (2x24kg men's) after 6 runs and 5 stations. It's a postural endurance test, not a grip test. Shoulders retracted, chest up, move as fast as possible \u2014 time under tension is non-linear.\n\n**Sandbag Lunges \u2014 The CrossFit Trap**\nCrossFit athletes often lunge with short, quick steps (quad-dominant). In Hyrox, this DESTROYS your quads before wall balls. Use 0.9-1.1m steps with posterior chain emphasis. This will feel weird coming from CrossFit \u2014 train it before race day.\n\n**The Running \u2014 Your Likely Weakness**\nLet's be honest: most CrossFit athletes undertrain running. Hyrox has 8km of running that accounts for 55-60% of your total time. If you're not running 20-30+ miles per week, your running will cap your overall performance regardless of how strong your stations are. Start building run volume immediately."}]}

Is that right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That video is giving you bad advice on both counts. Let me explain why, because this misconception is incredibly common and it's costing athletes significant time and energy.\n\n**Damper at 10 \u2014 Wrong:**\n\nThe damper controls airflow to the flywheel. At 10, maximum air enters, making each stroke feel heavy and sluggish \u2014 like rowing through mud. This does NOT make you faster. Here's what actually happens:\n\n- Your stroke rate drops because each stroke takes more force to complete\n- Your legs and back fatigue faster because of the higher force per stroke\n- In Hyrox specifically, you're destroying legs that need to last through farmer carry, lunges, wall balls, and two more runs\n\n**The correct damper range:** 4-7 for most athletes. Lighter athletes (under 75kg): 4-5. Medium (75-90kg): 5-6. Heavier (over 90kg): 6-7. This produces the best combination of power output and sustainable effort.\n\n**Highest Stroke Rate Possible \u2014 Also Wrong:**\n\nMore strokes per minute does not mean faster rowing. There's an optimal zone of 24-28 SPM for Hyrox where each stroke has maximum power and the recovery phase provides a micro-rest. Going above 30-32 SPM typically causes:\n\n- Shortened drive phase (less power per stroke)\n- Eliminated recovery (no micro-rest, heart rate spikes)\n- Technique breakdown (arms pulling before legs, hunched posture)\n\n**The correct approach:** Moderate stroke rate (24-28 SPM) with maximum power per stroke and a controlled recovery phase. The drive should be explosive; the recovery should be slow and deliberate \u2014 roughly a 2:1 recovery-to-drive ratio.\n\nWhat's your current 1000m row time and what have you been setting your damper at?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I've been rowing at damper 8-9 with about 34-36 SPM. My 1000m fresh is 3:50."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "3:50 at damper 8-9 with 34-36 SPM tells me you have genuinely strong rowing fitness but you're leaving time on the table through settings and technique. Let me project what's possible with adjustments.\n\n**The Experiment I Want You to Run:**\n\nNext rowing session, do 3 x 500m with full recovery:\n\n| Set | Damper | Target SPM | Focus |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | Your usual (8-9) | Your usual (34-36) | Baseline \u2014 note your 500m split and how your legs feel |\n| 2 | 5-6 | 28-30 | Longer, more powerful strokes. Full leg drive. Slow recovery. |\n| 3 | 5-6 | 26-28 | Even more deliberate. Maximum power per stroke. |\n\n**What I predict you'll find:**\n- Set 2 will produce a **similar or better split** than Set 1, at a lower heart rate\n- Set 3 will feel \"too slow\" but the actual split will surprise you\n- Your legs will feel noticeably fresher after Sets 2-3 compared to Set 1\n\n**Why this matters for your 3:50 fresh time:**\nAt damper 5-6 with 26-30 SPM, your 1000m should come in around **3:35-3:45** \u2014 that's a 5-15 second improvement purely from settings and technique. More importantly, in a RACE context (after BBJ, with stations remaining), the lower damper and stroke rate will:\n\n- Preserve leg energy for farmer carry, lunges, and wall balls\n- Keep heart rate 5-10 BPM lower\n- Produce an in-race row time of roughly **3:50-4:10** instead of what would probably be **4:30-4:50** at your current high-damper, high-rate approach\n\n**The Core Principle:**\nIn standalone rowing, you can get away with suboptimal settings because you rest afterward. In Hyrox, the row is Station 5 of 8 \u2014 everything you do on the rower affects the remaining three stations plus two runs. The goal isn't the fastest possible row; it's the fastest possible TOTAL race time. A 3:50 row that leaves your legs dead is worse than a 4:05 row that keeps them functional.\n\nDrop the damper to 5-6 and the stroke rate to 26-30. Trust the process for 3 sessions. Your splits and your overall race time will thank you."}]}
