Each cycle has clear progression targets. Compare that to most affiliates where the programming is \"constantly varied\" with no real thread connecting Monday's workout to next Monday's. PRVN's structure means your strength actually progresses \u2014 they use 5-3-1 style progressions for squat, deadlift, and press, building toward 1RM testing at cycle's end.\n\n**Themed Daily Structure**\n\nEvery day has a clear training intent:\n- **Monday**: Battery work + absolute strength (e.g., Back Squat 5RM paired with a 21:00 EMOM couplet)\n- **Wednesday**: Absolute leg strength (heavy 3s on Back Squat + 8:00 AMRAP leg stamina triplet)\n- **Thursday**: Aerobic/bodyweight focus (Every 3:00 x 10 sets alternating stations)\n- **Friday**: Olympic lifting + sprint chipper tester\n\nThis means you're not guessing what today's session is trying to accomplish.\n\n**Multi-Level Scaling**\n\nEvery WOD comes with Level 1, 2, and 3 prescriptions \u2014 distinct loading and rep schemes for each tier, not just \"scale as needed.\" This is huge for progressive development.\n\n**60-Minute Architecture**\n\nEach session follows a tightly managed template: 3-min whiteboard brief, 9-min warm-up, 6-min barbell primer, 5-min build, 12-min strength piece, 12-min conditioning, then mobility. Nothing is wasted.\n\n**The Hyrox Track**\n\nPRVN now offers a dedicated Hyrox track at $45/month with 8-week structured cycles, race-day prep protocols, and year-round programming. This is the biggest differentiator \u2014 they've built a purpose-specific track for Hyrox athletes alongside their CrossFit programming.\n\nIf you're considering Hyrox, the PRVN Hyrox track is one of the best commercial options available. If you want to stay CrossFit-focused but with better structure, the Affiliate track is a major upgrade from generic programming."}]}

I keep hearing it's percentage-based but I want to understand the actual system."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "HWPO's strength programming is one of the most systematically designed systems in the CrossFit space, and it translates well to Hyrox preparation if you know what to keep. Here's the architecture:\n\n**The Block System**\n\nHWPO operates on a **4-week block** structure: 3 weeks of progressive loading followed by 1 deload week. Two 4-week blocks form an 8-week cycle, and the macro structure runs in **16-week super-cycles** (16-16-16 across the year). This is textbook undulating periodization.\n\n**Percentage-Based Loading**\n\nAll strength work is prescribed as percentages of your tested 1RM. For example, a typical heavy squat day might look like:\n- 5 x 3 @ 82-88% 1RM, building across sets\n\nIf you haven't tested your maxes, they provide RPE-based fallbacks so you can still train within the right intensity zones.\n\n**Weekly Lift Distribution**\n\n- **Squats 2x/week**: One heavy back squat day, one lighter front squat day\n- **Deadlifts 1x/week**\n- **Bench press 1x/week**\n- **Olympic lifts ~3x/week** (volume varies by cycle phase)\n\nEach session includes 10-22+ working strength sets before you even touch the conditioning piece.\n\n**The Deload Week**\n\nThis is critical \u2014 the deload isn't a week off. It's reduced intensity and volume, but you're still training. Fraser designed this to prevent the accumulated fatigue that kills progress in weeks 5-6 of most programs.\n\n**Session Volume**\n\nA Flagship session runs roughly 2 hours: coaching video brief, intentional warm-up, strength progressions with accessories, gymnastics work, metcon or monostructural conditioning, more accessories, and an optional Zone 2 bonus session (40 minutes at 145 BPM).\n\n**For Hyrox application**, keep the 4-week block structure and percentage-based squat/deadlift work. Drop the Olympic lifting volume entirely \u2014 snatches and cleans have zero Hyrox transfer. Redirect that training time toward sled work, rowing intervals, and running."}]}

Here's what makes it distinct:\n\n**\"Program for the Majority, Not the Top 10%\"**\n\nBergeron's core principle is that programming for your best athletes and scaling for everyone else doesn't work. CompTrain designs workouts that are \"doable but difficult for most\" \u2014 the whole class does the same work. This is the opposite of HWPO or PRVN Competitor, which target high-level athletes.\n\n**Concurrent Development**\n\nThis is the biggest philosophical difference. Most programs block their periodization \u2014 strength month, then endurance month, then capacity month. CompTrain builds strength, endurance, and capacity **every single week, all year round.** They never enter a \"strength-only\" phase. For Hyrox, this is actually ideal because you need all three qualities simultaneously on race day.\n\n**Running as a Cornerstone**\n\nCompTrain includes running 2-3 times per week at varying intensities and distances, plus a dedicated Sunday run of 2-3 miles. This is **rare** for CrossFit programming. Most programs treat running as an afterthought. Bergeron calls it \"as functional as it gets.\"\n\n**Weekly Structure**\n\n- **Monday/Wednesday/Friday**: Strength (Press/Pull/Squat rotation) + 8-18 min conditioning\n- **Tuesday/Thursday**: Longer conditioning (20-35 min)\n- **Saturday**: Team workouts\n- **Sunday**: Dedicated 2-3 mile run\n\n**Benchmark Testing Every 2 Weeks**\n\nThey repeat 24 workouts annually for progress tracking. This gives you objective data on whether your fitness is improving.\n\n**No Complex Gymnastics**\n\nBergeron deliberately excludes muscle-ups, handstand walks, and other high-skill gymnastics. His reasoning: \"The reality of your member's lives demands strength, endurance, and capacity. It doesn't require them to know how to walk on their hands.\"\n\nFor your Hyrox goals, the running emphasis and concurrent development model are huge wins. The gap is zero sled work and insufficient race-specific station practice \u2014 but the foundation CompTrain builds is excellent."}]}

Am I leaving gains on the table?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good question \u2014 and the answer depends on what you're training for.\n\n**What Flagship 60 Removes**\n\nFlagship 60 is the time-constrained version of the full Flagship. To fit within ~60-70 minutes (including warm-up and cleanup), it makes these specific cuts:\n\n- **Drops either a strength piece or accessory work** from the full session\n- **Occasionally shortens metcons** by 25-33% (e.g., a 12-min AMRAP becomes an 8-min AMRAP)\n- **Lightens strength percentages slightly** on certain days\n- **Removes the optional bonus work** (which is typically a 40-min Zone 2 session on the bike or a run at 145 BPM)\n\nThe full Flagship runs approximately **1:45 to 2:00 hours** per session with 10-22+ working strength sets before conditioning. That's a massive training dose.\n\n**Are You Leaving Gains on the Table?**\n\nFor pure CrossFit competition \u2014 yes, somewhat. The extra volume in full Flagship builds more absolute strength and training density.\n\nFor Hyrox preparation \u2014 **Flagship 60 is actually the better choice**, and here's why:\n\n1. **Time efficiency**: 60-minute sessions free up time for dedicated running, which HWPO chronically underserves. You should be running 3-4x per week for Hyrox, and those 60+ minutes you save from full Flagship are better spent on the road.\n\n2. **Recovery management**: Hyrox prep requires concurrent training \u2014 running, strength, station work. A 2-hour strength session leaves you too depleted for quality running the next morning.\n\n3. **The cuts are smart**: Accessories and bonus work are the first things to go, and they're the least impactful for Hyrox performance.\n\n**My recommendation**: Stay on Flagship 60 for your strength foundation (squat, deadlift, bench progressions are preserved), and use the time savings to add 3-4 weekly running sessions and 2 Hyrox station practice sessions. That combination will outperform full Flagship for Hyrox every time."}]}

Two of these blocks form an 8-week cycle. The macro plan runs 16-week super-cycles (16-16-16).\n\nDuring the deload week, you're **not sitting on the couch**. Here's what changes:\n\n- **Strength volume drops ~30-40%** \u2014 fewer working sets, not necessarily lighter weights\n- **Conditioning intensity decreases** \u2014 shorter metcons, lower RPE targets\n- **Olympic lifting shifts to technique focus** \u2014 lighter complexes, positional work\n- **Zone 2 cardio remains or increases** \u2014 this is active recovery, not rest\n- **Mobility and accessory work stays consistent**\n\n**Why This Matters Physiologically**\n\nYour body doesn't get stronger during training \u2014 it gets stronger during recovery FROM training. Three weeks of progressive overload creates accumulated fatigue in your muscles, connective tissue, and central nervous system. The deload week allows:\n\n1. **Supercompensation**: Your body overshoots its previous fitness level when given adequate recovery after a training stimulus\n2. **Connective tissue repair**: Tendons and ligaments recover slower than muscles \u2014 the deload lets them catch up\n3. **CNS recovery**: Heavy squats and deadlifts tax your nervous system. Three weeks of grinding without a break leads to diminishing returns\n4. **Psychological reset**: Mental freshness is a real performance variable\n\n**For Hyrox Athletes Specifically**\n\nThe deload week is where I'd actually **increase your easy running volume slightly** while dropping strength volume. Your aerobic system benefits from consistent stimulus, and the reduced lifting load means your legs can handle more Zone 2 miles without accumulating excessive fatigue.\n\nThink of deloads as **investing in your next three weeks of progress**, not wasting a week.

It runs on the same platform as their other tracks (BTWB app and Wodify Marketplace) at **$45/month** with discounts for longer commitments \u2014 $128 for 3 months, $243 for 6 months, $432/year. All plans include a 7-day free trial.\n\n**Cycle Structure**\n\nThe program uses **8-week structured cycles** that run year-round. This is the same cycle length as their CrossFit affiliate programming, which means the periodization expertise transfers directly. Each cycle builds progressively with clear benchmarks.\n\n**What It Includes**\n\n- **Daily programming** specifically designed for Hyrox athletes at all levels\n- **Race-day preparation protocols** \u2014 priming workouts, warm-up sequences, pacing strategies\n- **Multi-level scaling** \u2014 the same Level 1/2/3 system they use in their CrossFit track, so beginners and competitive athletes can follow the same program\n- **Year-round training** \u2014 not just a 12-week pre-race block, but continuous programming you can follow between race seasons\n\n**What Transfers from PRVN's CrossFit DNA**\n\nThe Hyrox track inherits several strengths from PRVN's CrossFit programming:\n- **EMOM and interval formatting** that closely replicates work-rest pacing demands of transitioning between Hyrox running segments and stations\n- **Sled work** is already programmed in their CrossFit accessories (crossover sled drags, farmer carries)\n- **60-minute session architecture** with time-blocked phases\n- **Conditioning balanced across time domains** \u2014 short sprints, medium grinds, long endurance pieces\n\n**Honest Assessment**\n\nPRVN Hyrox scores an **8/10 for Hyrox readiness**. It's purpose-built, well-structured, and scalable. The only gap is for elite sub-55-minute athletes who need ultra-high running volume (35-40+ miles per week) \u2014 you'd need to supplement with additional dedicated running sessions beyond what the track prescribes.

My friend says Fraser programs metcons in a unique way."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your friend is right \u2014 Fraser's conditioning design is one of the most distinctive elements of HWPO. Here's what's different:\n\n**Forced-Break Interval Structure**\n\nThis is the signature HWPO conditioning format. Instead of long unbroken AMRAPs where athletes inevitably settle into a comfortable pace, Fraser programs **short work windows with built-in rest**. For example:\n\n- **4 x 2:00 AMRAPs with 1:00 rest** between rounds\n- **Tabata buy-in** (8 rounds: 20s on / 10s off) followed by 5 rounds of work\n\nThe logic is simple but powerful: shorter windows force **higher actual intensity per work period**. When you know you only have 2 minutes, you push harder than you would in a 20-minute AMRAP where you're subconsciously pacing. Then the rest period lets you partially recover before hitting the next window hard again.\n\n**Monostructural Separation**\n\nHWPO frequently programs dedicated rowing, biking, or running pieces **separate from metcons**. A typical Saturday might be a 40-minute EMOM alternating between rowing calories, wall balls, KB swings, and box jumps \u2014 10 full rounds. This is sustained mixed-modal conditioning at moderate intensity, building your aerobic engine.\n\n**Metcon Duration**\n\nHWPO metcons typically last **12-20 minutes**, which is a deliberate sweet spot. Long enough to create real metabolic stress, short enough to maintain quality movement patterns.\n\n**Zone 2 Bonus Work**\n\nEvery session has optional bonus work, often a **40-minute spin bike or run at 145 BPM** (Zone 2). This is the aerobic base building that most CrossFit programs completely ignore.\n\n**For Hyrox Application**\n\nThe forced-break interval format is **directly transferable** to Hyrox prep. Program it like this: 4 x 3:00 work windows of Hyrox station movements (sled push, wall balls, rowing) with 1:00 transitions simulating the run-to-station changeover. This trains your ability to sustain high output across transitions \u2014 exactly what Hyrox demands.\n\nThe Zone 2 bonus work is also critical. Don't skip it. Your aerobic base determines how well you recover between stations on race day."}]}

Is it linear progression or something else?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "CompTrain's strength approach is distinctive \u2014 it's neither classic linear progression nor traditional percentage-based block periodization. Here's how it works:\n\n**The Weekly Rotation**\n\nStrength follows a consistent **Press-Pull-Squat** rotation across the week:\n- **Monday**: Press (Bench Press or Shoulder Press)\n- **Wednesday**: Pull (Deadlift or Sumo Deadlift)\n- **Friday**: Squat (Back Squat or Front Squat)\n\nEach strength day is paired with a shorter conditioning piece (8-18 minutes). The non-strength days (Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday) are dedicated to longer conditioning work (20-35 minutes).\n\n**The Loading Method**\n\nThis is where CompTrain differs from HWPO's strict percentages. They use a combination of approaches that rotate across training weeks:\n\n1. **Max Reps at a fixed percentage**: e.g., \"Max Reps Back Squat @ 85%\" \u2014 this tests your strength-endurance at a given intensity\n2. **Climbing sets within a time window**: e.g., \"12:00 to build to a Heavy Single Deadlift\" \u2014 auto-regulated progression\n3. **Add weight from last attempt**: e.g., \"Back Squat: Add 10# from your 2/26 attempt\" \u2014 long-term tracking across months\n4. **Negative tempos**: e.g., \"Sumo Deadlift with 5-second negatives\" \u2014 eccentric loading for structural adaptation\n\n**The Benchmark System**\n\nEvery 2 weeks, one of 24 annual benchmark workouts replaces the scheduled conditioning. This creates a built-in progress tracking system \u2014 you repeat the same tests throughout the year and can objectively measure improvement.\n\n**For Hyrox Athletes**\n\nCompTrain's approach has real advantages for Hyrox prep:\n- The **\"Max Reps at percentage\"** format directly trains muscular endurance under load \u2014 exactly what you need for 100 wall balls or 200m lunges\n- The **concurrent development model** (never dropping strength, endurance, or capacity) matches Hyrox's simultaneous demands\n- The **\"Add weight from last attempt\"** tracking is something an AI coaching system should replicate for sled push/pull loads, row times, and wall ball pace\n\nThe gap is specificity \u2014 you'd need to swap some of the press/pull movements for Hyrox station work while keeping the loading methodology intact."}]}

Now let me be direct about which program gives you the best Hyrox ROI in 16 weeks.\n\n**My Recommendation: PRVN Hyrox Track**\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **You don't need more general strength.** A 315 squat means you already have more than enough raw strength for every Hyrox station. What you need now is **sport-specific conditioning and running volume** \u2014 and PRVN's Hyrox track delivers exactly that with 8-week structured cycles, station-specific programming, and race-day prep protocols.\n\n2. **PRVN Hyrox scores 8/10 for Hyrox readiness** compared to HWPO Flagship at 4/10 and CompTrain at 5/10. It's purpose-built for the event.\n\n3. **The scaling system works for you.** With your strength numbers, you'd operate at Level 2-3 on PRVN's scaling system, which means you'll be pushed appropriately without needing to modify everything yourself.\n\n**Why Not HWPO?**\nHWPO Flagship is a 2-hour per session commitment that's heavily weighted toward Olympic lifting and gymnastic skills \u2014 movements with **zero Hyrox transfer**. You'd spend significant time on snatches and muscle-ups when you should be doing sled pushes and running intervals. The HWPO Hyrox track (7/10) is better, but it's a newer program with less proven track record.\n\n**Why Not CompTrain?**\nCompTrain's running emphasis (2-3x/week) and concurrent development are excellent, but it has **no sled work, no race simulation, and no Hyrox-specific periodization.** You'd be building a great general fitness base while missing race-critical specificity.\n\n**What I'd Actually Prescribe**\n\nFollow PRVN Hyrox as your primary program, then supplement with:\n- **2-3 additional running sessions per week** (1 Zone 2 long run of 8-10 miles, 1 tempo run, 1 interval session)\n- **Maintain your squat and deadlift** at 1x/week each, but drop to 70-80% for sets of 5-8 (strength-endurance, not maximal strength)\n\nAt $45/month with a 7-day free trial, it's low risk to start immediately.

CompTrain deliberately excludes complex gymnastics and prioritizes accessible movements.\n\n2. **Running is already a cornerstone.** You're running 15 miles/week, and CompTrain programs running 2-3 times per week \u2014 more than any other CrossFit platform. This means the conditioning pieces will complement your existing running habit rather than conflict with it.\n\n3. **The concurrent development model is beginner-friendly.** You'll build strength, endurance, and capacity every week rather than doing a confusing periodization scheme. The weekly structure is predictable: strength + short conditioning on Monday/Wednesday/Friday, longer conditioning on Tuesday/Thursday, team workout Saturday, run Sunday.\n\n4. **Benchmark testing every 2 weeks** gives you concrete proof you're improving \u2014 critical for beginner motivation.\n\n**Your 16-Week Plan Structure**\n\n- **Weeks 1-4**: Follow CompTrain's daily programming to build general fitness. Add 1 extra easy run per week (bump to ~20 miles/week total).\n- **Weeks 5-12**: Continue CompTrain for strength days (Mon/Wed/Fri). Replace Tuesday and Thursday conditioning with Hyrox station practice \u2014 learn sled push/pull technique, wall balls, burpee broad jumps, rowing, ski erg, farmer carries, and lunges at light loads.\n- **Weeks 13-15**: Add a weekly Hyrox simulation \u2014 run 1km, do a station, run 1km, do another station. Start with 4 stations and build to 6-8.\n- **Week 16**: Taper \u2014 reduce volume by 40%, keep intensity moderate, practice race-day nutrition.\n\n**Immediate Priority**: Learn the sled push and sled pull. These are the stations that catch beginners off guard because you can't fake them \u2014 you either have the strength-endurance or you don't. Start with light weight and build."}]}

And with the PRVN Hyrox track, the conditioning pieces are already Hyrox-specific.\n\n**Second Option: HWPO Flagship 60**\n\nThis variant caps at 70 minutes including warm-up and removes either a strength piece or accessories from full Flagship. It preserves the percentage-based progressions for squat and deadlift while shortening metcons by 25-33%. The trade-off: it's CrossFit-focused, not Hyrox-specific, so you'd need to self-modify.\n\n**Avoid: Full HWPO Flagship**\n\nAt 1:45-2:00 hours per session, this is completely incompatible with your schedule. Don't try to cram it into 60 minutes \u2014 you'll just do everything badly.\n\n**My Actual Prescription for Your 5 Days**\n\n| Day | Focus | Time |\n|-----|-------|------|\n| **Monday** | Strength (Squat or Deadlift) + Hyrox station practice | 60 min |\n| **Tuesday** | Running \u2014 Tempo run 5-6 miles | 50-55 min |\n| **Wednesday** | Strength (Press/Pull) + conditioning finisher | 60 min |\n| **Thursday** | Running \u2014 VO2 max intervals (5x4 min @ 90-95% HR) | 50-55 min |\n| **Friday** | Hyrox simulation \u2014 3-4 stations with 1km runs between | 60 min |\n| **Weekend** | One easy Zone 2 run, 45-60 min | Optional |\n\nThis gives you 2 strength days, 2 running days, 1 race simulation, and an optional weekend run \u2014 all within 60 minutes. The PRVN Hyrox track fits perfectly into Monday, Wednesday, and Friday with your running layered on top."}]}

Supplement with:\n- 2 additional easy runs per week (Zone 2, 4-6 miles each)\n- 1 long run on weekends (build from 6 to 10 miles over 12 weeks)\n\n**Option B \u2014 Hybrid Approach (2x/week Hyrox add-on)**:\nFollow HWPO Strong 2.0 for 3 days/week (60-75 min sessions: primary lift + secondary lift + optional metcon). Layer in 2x/week HWPO Hyrox sessions. Add 2-3 running sessions independently.\n\n**I'd recommend Option A** for 12 weeks out. Here's why:\n- 12 weeks is short \u2014 you need maximum specificity\n- Your strength base from HWPO is already built \u2014 maintaining it with 2 strength sessions per week is sufficient\n- Running and station-specific conditioning are where you'll gain the most in this timeframe\n\n**Key Modifications**\n\nEven within the HWPO Hyrox track, apply these principles from Fraser's own philosophy:\n- Use the **forced-break interval format** for all station work: 4 x 2-min AMRAPs with 1-min rest\n- Keep the **4-week block periodization**: Weeks 1-4 build, Week 4 deload, Weeks 5-8 build, Week 8 deload, Weeks 9-11 peak, Week 12 taper\n- Hit the **Zone 2 bonus work** at least 3x/week \u2014 this is where your aerobic base for race day gets built\n\nYou're already paying for All Access. Use it."}]}

Here's my analysis:\n\n**Option 1: PRVN Hyrox Track ($45/month per athlete)**\n\n**Pros:**\n- Purpose-built Hyrox programming with 8-week cycles and race-day prep\n- Multi-level scaling (Level 1/2/3) so you can run a mixed-ability class\n- Coached by James Kelly, backed by Toomey/Orr's programming expertise\n- Daily programming year-round \u2014 less work for your coaching staff\n\n**Cons:**\n- Your athletes pay PRVN directly, not your gym\n- Less control over programming customization\n- Your coaches still need to understand the programming to deliver it well\n\n**Option 2: CompTrain for Your Regular Classes + Custom Hyrox Add-On**\n\n**This is what I'd actually recommend.** Here's the structure:\n\n- **Use CompTrain for your main group classes.** It's designed for affiliate class settings, has built-in coaching cues (\"Look For\" format), class management guidance, and the concurrent development philosophy builds broad fitness. The running emphasis (2-3x/week) already gives your members better Hyrox readiness than most CrossFit programming.\n\n- **Build a custom 2x/week Hyrox prep class** that layers on top. Schedule it in the evenings or on off-days. Focus on:\n  - **Session 1**: Hyrox station practice \u2014 rotate through 2-3 stations each week at race-specific loads and volumes (100 wall balls, 50m sled push, 1km row, etc.)\n  - **Session 2**: Race simulation \u2014 run 1km between 3-4 stations, building to full 8-station simulations as race day approaches\n\n**Why This Combination Works**\n\nCompTrain's benchmark testing every 2 weeks gives you progress data. Their strength programming (Press/Pull/Squat rotation) builds the foundation for sled and lunge performance. The running cornerstone closes the biggest gap in most CrossFit programming. And your custom Hyrox class adds the race-specific layer that no general CrossFit program provides.\n\n**Revenue Model**: CompTrain is a gym-level subscription. Your Hyrox prep class can be an add-on membership ($50-75/month) that drives incremental revenue while differentiating your gym from competitors. Much better economics than sending your athletes to PRVN."}]}

But \"for fun\" and \"competitive\" are different things, and I know how Quarterfinal athletes think. Let me give you the real talk.\n\n**What Your CrossFit Background Gives You**\n\nAs a Quarterfinal-level athlete, you already have:\n- **Work capacity across time domains** \u2014 Hyrox is a 60-90 minute chipper, and you've trained for this duration\n- **Movement familiarity** \u2014 you know wall balls, rowing, ski erg, sleds, carries, and burpees. CrossFit's own article calls Hyrox \"one heck of a chipper\"\n- **Mental toughness** \u2014 Hero WODs and long chippers have prepared you for the pain cave\n- **Metabolic conditioning** \u2014 you're adapted to phosphocreatine, glycolytic, and oxidative energy systems\n\n**What Will Bite You**\n\nMat Fraser himself admitted after his first Hyrox: \"The stations I was keeping up just fine. But on the running, there were a couple times I was like, 'O'Keefe, chill.'\" Fraser \u2014 the greatest CrossFitter ever \u2014 got caught by the running.\n\nHere's what CrossFit doesn't prepare you for:\n\n1. **8km of total running.** Your CrossFit programming includes 200m-1600m runs within WODs. Hyrox demands sustained running between every station. If you're not running 15-20+ miles per week regularly, the cumulative running fatigue will destroy your station times in the back half.\n\n2. **Pacing across 60-90 minutes.** CrossFit rewards all-out intensity. Hyrox punishes it. If you redline on the sled push, your next 1km run falls apart. This is a different skill.\n\n3. **Compromised running.** Running immediately after sled pushes and lunges is a specific capacity CrossFit doesn't train. Your legs will feel completely different than a fresh 1km.\n\n**Minimum Viable Prep (6 Weeks)**\n\n- Add **3 runs per week**: 1 easy (5-6 mi Zone 2), 1 tempo (3-4 mi at 75-85% HR), 1 interval (6x800m at race pace)\n- Do **1 weekly Hyrox simulation**: 4 stations with 1km runs between \u2014 practice pacing\n- Practice **sled push/pull at Hyrox race weights** (152kg push / 103kg pull for men). These loads are lighter than what you CrossFit with, but doing them after 5km of running is a different animal.\n\nSix weeks of this plus your existing CrossFit fitness, and you'll compete, not just finish."}]}

Let me lay out both paths clearly.\n\n**Option A: Switch to PRVN Hyrox Track**\n\nThis is the cleaner option. The Hyrox track runs 8-week cycles with race-day prep protocols built in. At 10 weeks out, you'd catch the beginning of a new cycle and still have 2 weeks for a taper/peak. The programming is purpose-built \u2014 sled work, station practice, running intervals, and scaled difficulty levels.

Here's what you'd change:\n\n1. **Replace all Olympic lifting days** (Friday snatch/clean work) with Hyrox station practice\n2. **Replace Tuesday gymnastics** (Ring MU, CTB pull-ups) with rowing/ski erg intervals\n3. **Keep Monday strength** (Back Squat 5RM + EMOM conditioning) \u2014 squat strength drives sled and lunge performance\n4. **Keep Thursday aerobic work** \u2014 the Every 3:00 x 10 sets format with running is already Hyrox-relevant\n5. **Add 2-3 running sessions per week** outside of PRVN programming\n\nWhat's your current running volume looking like?

Drop the long run distance to 4-5 miles. Focus on race-day nutrition practice and pacing strategy.\n\n**The critical rule**: Your easy runs must be **truly easy**. If you can't hold a full conversation, slow down. You're building aerobic infrastructure, not testing fitness. The hard work happens in the PRVN Hyrox sessions and your tempo/interval runs.\n\nThe jump from 3 to 13 miles in Week 1 is aggressive but manageable because most of it is Zone 2. Your CrossFit conditioning means your cardiovascular system can handle it \u2014 it's your running-specific musculature that needs to adapt. Expect some calf and shin soreness in weeks 1-2.

Total weekly running volume: ~20-25 miles.\n2. **Sled work 1-2x/week** fills CompTrain's biggest gap (no sled programming).\n3. **Station benchmarking** on Tuesday/Thursday mornings gives you objective data \u2014 track your 100 wall ball time, 1km row time, 50m sled push time every 2-3 weeks.\n4. Morning sessions are **separated from evening class by 10+ hours**, minimizing interference between running and strength work.\n5. **Friday morning is rest** \u2014 you hit CompTrain's heaviest strength day (squats) fresh.\n\nThis approach lets you keep the community, keep the coaching, and keep the programming you love while adding the Hyrox-specific layers that CompTrain doesn't provide."}]}

Forces higher intensity per work window than long unbroken AMRAPs\n- **Long EMOMs**: 40-minute EMOMs alternating between rowing, wall balls, KB swings, and box jumps (10 rounds)\n- **Monostructural separation**: Dedicated rowing, biking, or running pieces separate from mixed-modal metcons\n- **Zone 2 bonus work**: Optional 40-min spin/run at 145 BPM after every session\n- **Metcons run 12-20 minutes** typically\n\n**CompTrain Conditioning**\n- **Duration split**: 8-18 min pieces on strength days (Mon/Wed/Fri), 20-35 min pieces on conditioning days (Tue/Thu/Sat)\n- **Running integrated**: Running appears within conditioning 2-3x/week \u2014 \"Run Up\" has 4km of total running within the workout\n- **Sustainable intensity**: Movement pairings designed for \"sustainable power output\" rather than all-out sprints\n- **Team formats**: Saturday team workouts build pacing awareness under competitive pressure\n\nWhich builds the best Hyrox engine?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, which one?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For pure Hyrox engine building, here's my ranking:\n\n**1st: CompTrain's conditioning approach** \u2014 and it's not close for one reason: **running integration.** Hyrox is roughly 50% running by time. CompTrain is the only program that treats running as a cornerstone of conditioning, programming it 2-3x/week plus Sunday's dedicated run. Their longer conditioning pieces (20-35 min) also better approximate the sustained effort Hyrox demands. The concurrent development model \u2014 building endurance every week, all year \u2014 means your aerobic base never regresses.\n\n**2nd: HWPO's forced-break intervals + Zone 2** \u2014 Fraser's interval format is the best conditioning *template* for Hyrox station work. The 4 x 2-min AMRAP format, repopulated with Hyrox movements, directly simulates the run-to-station-to-run transitions. And the Zone 2 bonus work, if you actually do it consistently, builds the aerobic base that CompTrain builds through running. The issue: if you skip the bonus work (many athletes do because it's \"optional\"), you miss the aerobic development entirely.\n\n**3rd: PRVN's conditioning** \u2014 the time-domain variety is excellent for general fitness but not optimized for Hyrox's specific demands. The EMOM and interval formats are transferable, but the conditioning movements are too CrossFit-specific (ring muscle-ups, chest-to-bar pull-ups, snatches). The PRVN *Hyrox track* would rank much higher because it repopulates these formats with Hyrox movements.\n\n**The Optimal Approach for Your Hyrox Prep**\n\nSteal from all three:\n1. Use **CompTrain's running-as-cornerstone** philosophy \u2014 run 3-4x/week minimum\n2.

What exactly do I get?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let me give you a straight cost-benefit analysis based on what PRVN Hyrox actually delivers.\n\n**What You Get for $45/Month**\n\n1. **Structured 8-week training cycles** running year-round \u2014 this is continuous periodized programming, not a one-time 12-week plan. Each cycle builds progressively with clear benchmarks and transitions.\n\n2. **Daily programming** specifically designed for Hyrox athletes at all levels. Sessions follow PRVN's proven 60-minute architecture:\n   - 3-min whiteboard brief (intent and pacing guidance)\n   - 9-min movement-specific warm-up\n   - 6-min skill/barbell primer\n   - 5-min build to working loads\n   - 12-min strength piece\n   - 12-min conditioning\n   - 5-min mobility + cool-down\n\n3. **Multi-level scaling** \u2014 every workout comes with Level 1, 2, and 3 prescriptions with distinct loads and rep schemes. You're not just \"scaling down\" \u2014 each level is purposefully designed for different athlete capabilities.\n\n4. **Hyrox-specific movement integration** \u2014 sled work (crossover sled drags), farmer carries, and station-specific conditioning are built into the programming. These are the movements most general fitness programs completely miss.\n\n5. **Race-day preparation protocols** \u2014 priming workouts, warm-up sequences, and pacing strategies for competition.\n\n**Cost Comparison**\n\nYou can reduce the cost significantly with longer commitments:\n- Monthly: $45/month\n- 3-month: $128 (~$42.67/month)\n- 6-month: $243 (~$40.50/month)\n- Annual: $432 ($36/month \u2014 20% savings)\n\nAll plans include a **7-day free trial**, so you can evaluate the programming before committing.\n\n**Is It Worth It?**\n\nCompared to alternatives:\n- HWPO All Access ($49/month) includes a Hyrox track but it's newer with less Hyrox-specific track record\n- HAOS ($39.99/month) is multi-sport, not Hyrox-exclusive\n- A personal Hyrox coach: $150-300+/month\n\nAt $36-45/month, PRVN Hyrox is one of the best value propositions for structured, expert-designed Hyrox programming. The 8-week cycles with built-in periodization and multi-level scaling would cost you significantly more from a personal coach.\n\n**My honest recommendation**: Start the 7-day trial, evaluate the first week's programming quality, and commit to at least a 3-month block to get through a full cycle. If you're serious about Hyrox, this is a solid investment."}]}

HWPO Strong 2.0 was practically designed for this kind of layering. Here's why and how:\n\n**Why HWPO Strong Works as a Hyrox Strength Base**\n\n- **Session length**: 60-75 minutes \u2014 compact enough to pair with running or station work on the same day or as a separate session\n- **Structure**: Warm-up \u2192 primary lift \u2192 secondary lift \u2192 accessory work \u2192 optional metcon. Clean, efficient, no wasted time on gymnastics or Olympic lifting\n- **Periodization**: 4-8 week blocks with deload every 4th week \u2014 this aligns perfectly with Hyrox prep mesocycles\n- **Loading**: Hybrid percentage + RPE progression \u2014 auto-regulates when you're fatigued from running\n\n**The Combination Plan**\n\nHere's how I'd structure a week combining HWPO Strong with Hyrox training:\n\n| Day | AM Session | PM Session |\n|-----|-----------|------------|\n| **Mon** | Easy run, 4-5 mi (Zone 2) | HWPO Strong (Squat focus) |\n| **Tue** | Tempo run, 5 mi | Hyrox station practice (30-40 min) |\n| **Wed** | \u2014 | HWPO Strong (Upper body focus) |\n| **Thu** | VO2 max intervals (6x4 min @ 90-95% HR) | Hyrox station practice (30-40 min) |\n| **Fri** | Easy run, 4 mi (Zone 2) | HWPO Strong (Deadlift/hinge focus) |\n| **Sat** | Long run 7-9 mi (Zone 2) + race simulation | \u2014 |\n| **Sun** | Rest or light mobility | \u2014 |\n\n**Volume Management**\n\nTotal weekly load:\n- 3 HWPO Strong sessions (~3.5 hours)\n- 4-5 runs (~4-5 hours)\n- 2 station practice sessions (~1.5 hours)\n- **Total: ~9-10 hours/week**\n\nThis is manageable because:\n1. HWPO Strong's **optional metcon** \u2014 skip it on days you have station work. The primary and secondary lifts are sufficient strength stimulus.\n2. The **deload every 4th week** reduces both HWPO Strong volume AND running volume simultaneously. During deload: drop to 2 Strong sessions, reduce running mileage by 30%, keep 1 easy station practice session.\n3. **RPE-based loading** means on days after hard running, you naturally adjust weights downward without abandoning the session structure.\n\n**The Key Rule**\n\nSeparate AM running from PM lifting by **6+ hours minimum**. The interference effect between endurance and strength training is minimized with adequate separation. Never run hard in the morning and squat heavy that same evening \u2014 one of them will suffer.\n\nUse HWPO Strong's deload weeks as your recovery valve. When fatigue accumulates from the combined training load, the programmed deload catches you before you overtrain."}]}

You must supplement with additional runs.\n- **Session length**: 60 minutes \u2014 efficient and manageable\n\n**CompTrain \u2014 Best Foundation Builder for Hyrox**\n- **Hyrox readiness**: Medium-High (strong general preparation)\n- **Running**: The clear winner \u2014 2-3x/week plus Sunday runs. No other CrossFit program takes running this seriously. This is the single most important differentiator for Hyrox.\n- **Best transfer elements**: Running volume, concurrent development (never drops any quality), sustainable intensity philosophy, benchmark testing for progress tracking\n- **Biggest gap**: Zero sled work and insufficient race-length sessions. No Hyrox-specific programming at all.\n- **Session length**: ~60 minutes\n- **No complex gymnastics** \u2014 deliberately excluded, which means zero wasted training time for Hyrox athletes\n\n**HWPO \u2014 Best Strength Engine, Worst Hyrox Fit**\n- **Hyrox readiness**: Medium-Low (needs heavy modification)\n- **Strength**: Unmatched. Percentage-based, high-volume programming with the best periodization structure (4-week blocks, 16-week macros with deloads)\n- **Best transfer elements**: Rowing volume (Fraser loves the rower), Zone 2 bonus work, forced-break interval conditioning format, block periodization\n- **Biggest gaps**: Running is essentially absent, no sled/lunge specificity, Olympic lifting and gymnastics consume massive training time with zero Hyrox transfer. Flagship sessions run 2 hours \u2014 incompatible with adding running.\n- **Session length**: ~2 hours (Flagship) or 60 min (Flagship 60 / Strong)\n\n**The Verdict**\n\nIf you can only pick one:\n1. **PRVN Hyrox track** if you want the closest thing to a complete Hyrox program (supplement with running)\n2. **CompTrain** if you want the best general fitness foundation and running base (supplement with sled work and race simulations)\n3. **HWPO** only if you're already subscribed and want to use Strong 2.0 as your strength base while building everything else independently\n\n**What I'd actually prescribe**: Take CompTrain's running philosophy, HWPO's periodization structure and forced-break interval format, and PRVN's Hyrox-specific station programming. Combine them into a custom plan. No single program scores a 10/10 for Hyrox \u2014 but the synthesis of all three gets close."}]}

Filly is a 6-time CrossFit Games athlete who pivoted his entire training philosophy after experiencing severe burnout and physical breakdown following the 2016 CrossFit Games. The program blends traditional bodybuilding hypertrophy methods with functional movement patterns, controlled tempos, and an explicit emphasis on recovery and longevity.\n\n**The Core Philosophy**\n\nPersist is built on the principle of **\"Look Good, Move Well\"** \u2014 building visible muscle while maintaining joint health, mobility, and movement competence. It uses progressive overload through **multiple levers**, not just adding weight:\n- Load, reps, volume, rest periods, range of motion, tempo, frequency, and exercise complexity all serve as progression variables\n- RPE-based loading (Rate of Perceived Exertion) rather than fixed percentages\n- **Controlled tempo** is the signature tool \u2014 notation like **32X1** means 3 seconds down, 2-second hold at bottom, explosive up, 1-second pause at top\n\n**Program Structure**\n\nPersist offers 5 tracks on 6-week training cycles:\n- **Pillars** (4 days/week, 60 min) \u2014 compound lifts + conditioning finishers\n- **Pump Condition** (5 days/week, 75 min) \u2014 hypertrophy + conditioning\n- **Pump Lift** (5 days/week, 75 min) \u2014 pure hypertrophy, no conditioning\n- **Perform** (5 days/week, 90 min) \u2014 Olympic lifts + functional fitness\n- **Minimalist** (5 days/week, 60 min) \u2014 minimal equipment\n\nAll tracks include 2-3 dedicated mobility sessions per week and one full rest day.\n\n**For Hyrox: Honest Assessment \u2014 2/10 Readiness**\n\nI'm going to be direct: Persist is a **terrible standalone Hyrox program**. Here's why:\n- **Zero running programming** \u2014 Hyrox has 8km of total running\n- **No Hyrox-specific movements** \u2014 no sled push/pull, no wall balls, no rowing at race volumes, no burpee broad jumps\n- **Limited aerobic base development** \u2014 conditioning finishers exist but aren't designed for a 60-75 minute race\n- **No race-specific periodization** \u2014 continuous 6-week cycles with no taper or peak\n\n**Where Persist IS Valuable for Hyrox Athletes**\n\nDon't write it off completely. Persist's tempo-controlled lifting builds **resilient connective tissue and muscular endurance** \u2014 directly transferable to sled pushes, lunges, and wall balls performed under extreme fatigue. The RPE-based auto-regulation system is also valuable when you're managing fatigue from concurrent running and strength training. And the integrated mobility sessions help prevent the overtraining injuries that plague Hyrox athletes.\n\nUse Persist as an **off-season hypertrophy and structural balance block** (one 6-week cycle between race seasons), not as your primary Hyrox training."}]}

How do those tempo prescriptions work and why should I care?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Tempo prescriptions are one of the most underutilized tools in Hyrox preparation, and Filly has made them a core pillar of his Functional Bodybuilding system. Let me break down exactly how they work and why they matter for you.\n\n**How Tempo Notation Works**\n\nA tempo like **32X1** describes four phases of a rep:\n- **3** = 3 seconds on the eccentric (lowering/lengthening phase)\n- **2** = 2-second pause at the bottom position\n- **X** = eXplode on the concentric (lifting phase)\n- **1** = 1-second pause at the top before the next rep\n\nSo a back squat at 32X1 tempo means: 3 seconds down, 2-second hold in the hole, explode up, 1-second pause standing. Each rep takes approximately 7 seconds. A set of 6 reps is 42 seconds of time under tension \u2014 compared to maybe 18 seconds with normal tempo.\n\n**Why This Matters for Hyrox**\n\n1. **Muscular endurance under load.** A Hyrox sled push is essentially a slow, grinding concentric contraction sustained over 50 meters. Tempo squats and deadlifts train your muscles to produce force for extended durations \u2014 the exact quality the sled demands.\n\n2. **Connective tissue resilience.** The controlled eccentric and pause phases load tendons and ligaments progressively. Hyrox athletes accumulate enormous mechanical stress across 8 stations \u2014 tempo training builds the structural integrity to absorb that stress without injury.\n\n3. **Movement quality under fatigue.** When you're 60 minutes into a Hyrox race performing your 75th wall ball, your movement patterns degrade. Tempo training forces you to maintain positional control through every phase of the rep, building motor patterns that hold up when you're exhausted.\n\n4. **Hypertrophy at lower loads.** Tempo increases time under tension dramatically, which drives muscle growth without requiring maximal loads. This means you can build Hyrox-relevant muscle while managing overall training stress.\n\n**Practical Application for Your Hyrox Prep**\n\nI'd integrate tempo work into 1-2 strength sessions per week:\n\n- **Back Squat** at 30X1 tempo: 4 sets x 6 reps, RPE 7-8, rest 2:30\n- **Romanian Deadlift** at 40X0 tempo: 3 sets x 8 reps, RPE 7, rest 2:00\n- **DB Walking Lunge** at 20X1 tempo: 3 sets x 10/leg, moderate load\n\nThe eccentric control on lunges directly simulates the deceleration phase of sandbag lunges in Hyrox. The pause squat builds the bottom-position strength needed for wall balls.\n\nDon't use tempo on every lift \u2014 save it for your compound movements that have direct Hyrox transfer. Keep your Hyrox station practice at normal speed so you're also training race-pace movement patterns."}]}

That's a legitimate elite performance, especially for someone who didn't train exclusively for Hyrox.\n\n**His Training Philosophy**\n\n1. **Two-a-days as the default**: Morning runs, evening strength training. Separating modalities by 6+ hours minimizes the interference effect between endurance and strength adaptations.\n\n2. **\"Don't add \u2014 replace\"**: When incorporating running, cut lifting from 5 days to 3 and add 2-3 running days. Don't just pile on more total sessions.\n\n3. **\"Stimulate, don't obliterate\"**: Get the training stimulus without destroying recovery capacity \u2014 critical when managing concurrent running and lifting stress.\n\n4. **Polarized running**: Follow the 80/20 model. His current weekly split shows 4 of 6 running days are easy-pace efforts, with only 1 quality session (Wednesday tempo/track workout).\n\n**His Hyrox-Phase Training Split (October 2024)**\n\n| Day | Morning | Afternoon |\n|-----|---------|----------|\n| Mon | 10 easy miles | Hyrox circuit training |\n| Tue | \u2014 | Upper body strength + core |\n| Wed | Tempo/track workout (10-12 mi) | Lower body strength |\n| Thu | 10 easy miles | Hyrox circuit training |\n| Fri | ~8 easy miles | Upper body strength + core |\n| Sat | Long run + accessory work | \u2014 |\n| Sun | 8-10 easy miles | \u2014 |\n\n**Weekly running: ~65 miles/week**\n\nThat's an extremely high volume reflecting years of progressive base building. He trains Hyrox circuits 2x/week (Monday and Thursday afternoons) with sport-specific stations: sled push, sled pull, wall balls, burpee broad jumps, farmers carry, and rowing.\n\n**Where He Lost Time**\n\nAnalysis of his Hyrox result showed he lost time on **sled pull, burpees, rowing, and wall balls** \u2014 the more technical Hyrox-specific movements. His running and carry stations were strong. This suggests more dedicated station practice (beyond 2x/week) could improve his race performance.\n\n**Key Takeaway for You**\n\nBare's methodology proves that a high aerobic base combined with sport-specific circuits is a viable Hyrox approach. But you don't need 65 miles/week \u2014 that reflects his marathon/ultra background. For most Hyrox athletes, 25-40 miles/week with 2-3 dedicated station sessions is the sweet spot."}]}

Here's the straightforward breakdown:\n\n**What You Get**\n\n- **Cost**: Completely free \u2014 unlimited access to all programming\n- **Programs available**: 4 programs \u2014 Hybrid Athlete, 5K, Half Marathon, Marathon\n- **Duration**: 12-16 weeks each\n- **Creators**: Nick Bare and Jeff Cunningham\n- **Integration**: Garmin Connect compatibility for syncing health and fitness data\n- **Content**: Exercise library with video demonstrations, educational articles on fitness and nutrition\n\n**The Hybrid Athlete Program**\n\nThis is the flagship program and follows a **Push/Pull/Lower** strength training split combined with running workouts:\n\n| Day | AM | PM |\n|-----|-----|-----|\n| Day 1 | Easy Run | Push Strength |\n| Day 2 | Easy Run | Pull Strength |\n| Day 3 | Interval Run | Lower Body Strength |\n| Day 4 | Optional Aerobic | Dedicated Mobility |\n| Day 5 | Threshold Run | Upper Body Hypertrophy |\n| Day 6 | Rest | Dedicated Mobility |\n| Day 7 | Easy Run | Lower Body Hypertrophy |\n\nIt includes 5 weight training sessions, 5 running workouts, and 2 dedicated mobility days per week. The strength programming uses traditional bodybuilding rep schemes (4x8-12) with supersets.\n\n**For Hyrox: Honest Assessment \u2014 Not Recommended as Primary Training**\n\nHere's the critical gap: **BPN Training has zero Hyrox-specific programming.** None of the four programs include sled push/pull, wall balls, burpee broad jumps, ski erg, rowing for distance, farmer carries, or sandbag lunges. The Hybrid Athlete program cleanly separates running and strength training \u2014 there's no equivalent to Hyrox circuit work or race simulation.\n\n**What It IS Useful For**\n\n1. **Building a concurrent training foundation**: If you're coming from pure strength training and have never combined running with lifting, BPN's Hybrid Athlete program is a free, well-structured on-ramp to hybrid training.\n2. **The running programs are solid**: The 5K through Marathon progressions demonstrate structured running periodization knowledge that supports aerobic development.\n3. **Garmin integration**: Adaptive programming based on real physiological data is valuable for managing training load.\n\n**My Recommendation**\n\nUse BPN Training as a **free entry point** if you're new to hybrid training. Follow the Hybrid Athlete program for 12 weeks to build your concurrent training base. Then transition to a Hyrox-specific program (PRVN Hyrox, LEVLS, or a custom plan) that adds station work, race simulation, and Hyrox periodization. BPN gives you the chassis \u2014 you still need to install the Hyrox-specific engine."}]}

I heard it's very methodical."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Persist's session architecture is one of the most thoughtfully designed in the industry. Every workout follows a consistent structure that Filly has refined over years. Here's exactly how it's organized:\n\n**The Five-Phase Session Architecture**\n\n**Phase 1: Warm-Up / Pre-Fatigue**\nLight cardio (ski, row, run) plus movement-specific prep. The key innovation here is **pre-fatigue** \u2014 you target the muscle groups of the day with higher-rep, lighter-load exercises before the main lifts. For example, before a pressing session, you might do Bradford Z Press for 1-2 sets of 10-15 reps. The goal is to prepare the body and activate the target muscles without fatiguing them enough to compromise the main lifts.\n\n**Phase 2: Strength Intensity (Main Lifts)**\nThe core of the session. Compound movements with progressive overload using multiple loading formats:\n- **Building sets**: RPE 6 \u2192 7 \u2192 8 across sets, then a back-off set at 80% of top weight for max reps\n- **Reverse pyramid**: Start heaviest (4-6 reps) \u2192 medium (6-8 reps, 5-10% lighter) \u2192 lightest (8-10 reps, 5-10% lighter again)\n- **Timed intervals**: e.g., Every 2:30 x 4 sets, building across\n\nAll with specific **tempo prescriptions** (e.g., 30X0 or 20X1) controlling every phase of every rep.\n\n**Phase 3: Strength Balance (Accessories)**\nSupersets or agonist pairings targeting smaller muscle groups. Higher volume, moderate intensity, shorter rest. Example: JM Press 3x8-10 \u2192 Inverted Skull Crusher 3x12-15, alternating on a 3:30 clock with 15-second transitions.\n\n**Phase 4: Conditioning Finisher** (Pillars and Pump Condition tracks only)\nEMOMs, AMRAPs, or circuits combining monostructural cardio with loaded movements. Example from Pump Condition: Row 12 Cal Sprint \u2192 6 KB Deadlifts (70 lb) \u2192 200 ft KB Farmers Walk \u2192 6 KB Deadlifts \u2192 12 Body Rows, every 3:00 x 4 sets.\n\n**Phase 5: Hypertrophy Finisher / Cool-Down**\nDrop sets, isolation work, and/or stretching/mobility. Final set often includes a drop set to failure (reduce weight 30% and continue).\n\n**The \"Short on Time\" Option**\nFor sessions over 60 minutes, Persist provides a condensed version \u2014 typically reducing sets (e.g., 2 instead of 4) or cutting the conditioning section.\n\n**For Hyrox Application**\n\nThis Pre-Fatigue \u2192 Strength Intensity \u2192 Strength Balance \u2192 Conditioning Finisher architecture is a transferable framework. Apply it to Hyrox strength days: warm-up with light sled work or rowing as pre-fatigue, squat or deadlift as the main lift with tempo control, superset accessories targeting lunge/carry muscles, finish with a 10-minute Hyrox station circuit."}]}

What does that actually mean for training?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Stimulate, don't obliterate\" is Bare's most important training principle, and it's especially critical for Hyrox athletes managing concurrent training stress. Let me unpack what it means practically.\n\n**The Core Concept**\n\nEvery training session needs to provide enough stimulus to trigger adaptation \u2014 but not so much that it destroys your ability to recover and train effectively the next day. This sounds obvious, but most athletes get it wrong in one of two ways:\n\n1. **They obliterate**: Going to absolute failure on every set, running every run at tempo pace, finishing every session on the floor. This creates so much fatigue that subsequent sessions are compromised.\n\n2. **They under-stimulate**: Being so afraid of overtraining that sessions lack the intensity needed to drive adaptation.\n\nBare's principle sits in the middle: **get the training effect, then stop.**\n\n**What This Looks Like in Practice**\n\n**Strength training:**\n- Stop sets 1-2 reps short of failure (RPE 7-8, not RPE 10)\n- If prescribed 4x8 squats at RPE 8, and you could do 10 reps with that weight \u2014 stop at 8. Don't chase the extra reps.\n- Exception: Occasional max-effort testing (every 4-6 weeks) where you push to RPE 10\n\n**Running:**\n- Easy runs are truly easy \u2014 conversational pace, Zone 1-2. Most athletes run their easy days too fast, turning what should be recovery into additional stress.\n- Quality sessions (tempo, intervals) are hard \u2014 but you don't add extra reps or extend the duration because you \"feel good.\" Hit the prescription, cool down, leave.\n\n**Hyrox station work:**\n- Practice stations at race pace and race volume, but don't turn every practice session into a time trial\n- 2-3 focused station sessions per week is sufficient. More than that and you accumulate fatigue without additional adaptation.\n\n**Why This Matters for Hyrox Specifically**\n\nHyrox demands **concurrent training** \u2014 running, strength, and station-specific conditioning. Each modality creates fatigue that affects the others:\n\n- A leg-destroying squat session on Monday means your Tuesday run suffers\n- An all-out 10-mile tempo run on Wednesday means your Thursday sled practice is weak\n- Obliterating yourself at every session creates a cascade of compromised training\n\nBare manages this through:\n1. **AM/PM splits** \u2014 separate running from strength by 6+ hours\n2. **Auto-regulation** \u2014 adjust training based on how the body responds that day\n3. **Purposeful sessions** \u2014 every session has a clear objective, and you stop when the objective is achieved\n\n**The Practical Rule**\n\nAfter every session, ask: \"Could I do this again tomorrow if I absolutely had to?\" If the answer is no, you went too hard. The exception is your 1 weekly race simulation \u2014 that should leave you spent. Everything else should stimulate, not obliterate."}]}

I've always trained with percentages and don't get how RPE works."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is a great question, and understanding RPE will actually make you a better self-coached athlete for Hyrox. Here's how Filly implements it and why it matters.\n\n**RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) Basics**\n\nRPE is a 1-10 scale measuring how hard a set felt relative to your maximum effort:\n\n| RPE | Meaning | Reps in Reserve |\n|-----|---------|----------------|\n| 6 | Light \u2014 could do 4+ more reps | 4+ RIR |\n| 7 | Moderate \u2014 could do 3 more reps | 3 RIR |\n| 8 | Hard \u2014 could do 2 more reps | 2 RIR |\n| 9 | Very hard \u2014 could do 1 more rep | 1 RIR |\n| 10 | Maximum \u2014 could not do another rep | 0 RIR |\n\n**How Filly Uses It in Persist**\n\nInstead of prescribing \"Back Squat 4x6 @ 80%,\" Filly writes something like:\n\n- **Working Set 1**: 6 reps @ RPE 6 (Every 2:30)\n- **Working Set 2**: 6 reps @ RPE 7 (Every 2:30)\n- **Working Set 3 (Top Set)**: 6 reps @ RPE 8 (Every 2:30)\n- **Back-Off Set 4**: AMRAP @ 80% of Set 3 weight (continuous tension, no pausing between reps)\n\nYou build across sets by feel, hitting your heaviest weight at RPE 8, then drop 20% and do max reps.\n\n**Why RPE Beats Percentages for Hyrox Athletes**\n\n1. **Auto-regulation on fatigued days.** If you ran hard yesterday morning and your legs are tired, your 80% squat might feel like 90% today. RPE naturally accounts for this \u2014 you select a weight that feels like RPE 8 regardless of what the number on the bar is.\n\n2. **No 1RM testing required.** Many Hyrox athletes don't have recent 1RM tests (and shouldn't waste training time on maximal testing when preparing for an endurance event). RPE works immediately without baseline data.\n\n3. **Manages concurrent training stress.** When you're running 25+ miles per week AND doing sled work AND lifting, daily readiness varies dramatically. RPE adapts to your actual recovery status.\n\n4. **Prevents overtraining.** Filly's prescription rarely exceeds RPE 8 for working sets. This aligns with the \"stimulate, don't obliterate\" principle \u2014 you're getting the training stimulus without excessive fatigue.\n\n**How to Calibrate Your RPE**\n\nHonest self-assessment takes practice. Most beginners underestimate their RPE (they think they're at 8 when they're really at 6). Here's how to calibrate:\n\n- Spend 2-3 weeks building to genuine failure (RPE 10) on your last set of each exercise\n- Once you know what RPE 10 feels like, RPE 7-8 becomes much more accurate\n- Film your sets \u2014 bar speed tells the truth. If the last rep moves as fast as the first, you're not at RPE 8.\n\nFor your Hyrox strength work, I'd prescribe most working sets at **RPE 7-8** and reserve RPE 9-10 for benchmark testing every 4-6 weeks."}]}

That makes this an easy call.\n\n**Follow Nick Bare's Hybrid Approach. Not Persist.**\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n**Why Not Persist**\n- Persist is a hypertrophy and movement quality program. You already have hypertrophy. Adding more hypertrophy training to a bodybuilder is like adding more horsepower to a car with no wheels \u2014 you need the wheels (aerobic capacity and sport-specific conditioning).\n- Persist has **zero running programming** \u2014 the single biggest gap you need to fill\n- Persist has **no Hyrox-specific movements** \u2014 no sleds, no rowing, no carries at race distances\n- Persist scores **2/10 for Hyrox readiness**\n- The only thing Persist would give you that's valuable is **tempo training for connective tissue resilience** and **RPE-based auto-regulation** \u2014 both of which you can incorporate without following the full program\n\n**Why Nick Bare's Approach**\n- Bare literally made the same transition you're making \u2014 from bodybuilding/powerlifting to hybrid athlete. He realized he was \"missing something vital\" (cardiovascular conditioning) and built his entire methodology around combining serious strength with serious running.\n- His **\"Don't add \u2014 replace\"** principle is perfect for you: cut lifting from 5 days to 3, add 2-3 running days\n- His **two-a-day structure** (AM runs, PM strength) lets you keep lifting without sacrificing running quality\n- He proved the approach works at Hyrox with a **1:05:42 Pro Division finish (9th place, top 8%)**\n- His Hybrid Athlete program uses **traditional bodybuilding rep schemes** (4x8-12) that you're already comfortable with\n\n**Your Specific Transition Plan**\n\n**Weeks 1-4 (Base Building)**\n- Drop lifting to 3 days: Push/Pull/Lower split, 45-60 min per session\n- Add 3 runs: 2 easy (3-4 miles, Zone 2) + 1 interval (6x400m with 2 min rest)\n- Start with 12-15 miles/week of running \u2014 don't jump to Bare's 65 miles\n\n**Weeks 5-8 (Hyrox Introduction)**\n- Maintain 3 lifting days but shift toward functional movements: replace leg press with lunges, add farmer carries, add sled work\n- Progress running to 18-22 miles/week: add a tempo run and extend easy runs\n- Add 1 Hyrox station practice session per week\n\n**Weeks 9-16 (Hyrox Specificity)**\n- 2 lifting days (maintenance), 4 running days, 2 Hyrox station/simulation sessions\n- Running peaks at 25-30 miles/week\n\n**Take ONE Thing from Persist**\n\nIncorporate Filly's tempo prescriptions into your strength work \u2014 specifically 30X1 back squats and 40X0 Romanian deadlifts. These will build the muscular endurance under load that Hyrox demands, and as a bodybuilder you'll appreciate the added time under tension."}]}

You need to build functional strength fast.\n\n**My Recommendation: Start with BPN Training, Then Add Specificity**\n\nHere's why:\n\n**BPN Training (Start Here \u2014 Weeks 1-8)**\n- **It's free** \u2014 zero barrier to entry for someone completely new to strength training\n- The **Hybrid Athlete program** combines running with a Push/Pull/Lower strength split over 12-16 weeks\n- It includes **dedicated mobility days** (2/week) which you'll desperately need as a runner adding strength work\n- The **Garmin Connect integration** adapts to your fitness data \u2014 useful for managing the new training stress\n- The rep schemes are simple and accessible: 4x8-12 with basic exercises (bench, deadlift, squat, rows)\n- It teaches you how to structure concurrent training without overwhelming you\n\n**Why Not Persist**\n- Persist is **not suited for true beginners** \u2014 Filly and reviewers consistently note the training volume and exercise complexity assume intermediate-to-advanced lifting experience\n- The tempo prescriptions (32X1, 40X0) add a layer of complexity that a strength training beginner doesn't need yet\n- At $39/month, it's an unnecessary cost when BPN is free and more appropriate for your level\n- Persist has **zero running programming** \u2014 and while you know how to run, you still need a program that integrates running with lifting (which Persist doesn't do)\n\n**The Full Plan**\n\n**Phase 1: BPN Hybrid Athlete (Weeks 1-8)**\n- Follow the program as written \u2014 learn the movements, build baseline strength\n- Reduce your running to 25-30 miles/week (down from your marathon volume) to create recovery bandwidth for lifting\n- Your body needs time to adapt to the new stimulus of strength training\n\n**Phase 2: Hyrox-Specific Transition (Weeks 9-16)**\n- Keep 2 BPN strength sessions per week for maintenance (Push and Pull days)\n- Replace the Lower body day with Hyrox station practice: sled push/pull, lunges with sandbag, wall balls\n- Add 2 dedicated Hyrox sessions per week: station circuits + race simulation\n- Return running to 30-35 miles/week with 80/20 intensity distribution\n\n**One Persist Principle to Steal Early**\n\nEven though I'm not recommending the full program, adopt Filly's **RPE-based loading approach** from day one. As a strength training beginner, you don't have 1RM data. Use RPE 6-7 for your first 4 weeks (building movement patterns), then progress to RPE 7-8 for working sets.

You can't cheat through a 30X1 squat.\n- **Integrated mobility**: 2-3 dedicated sessions per week, embedded into the program rather than tacked on as optional\n- **RPE-based loading**: Auto-regulates intensity so you're building quality, not just chasing weight\n- **Unilateral work**: Extensive single-leg exercises (drop lunges, split squats) that expose and correct asymmetries\n\n**The Conditions**\n\n1. **One 6-week cycle only.** Persist runs on 6-week cycles \u2014 do exactly one. Don't get comfortable and stay for three cycles while your race date approaches.\n\n2. **Choose the Pillars track** (4 days/week, 60 min). It includes conditioning finishers (EMOMs, AMRAPs) which maintain some metabolic stimulus while you focus on movement quality. Pump Lift has zero conditioning.\n\n3. **Maintain running throughout.** Persist has no running \u2014 add 3 easy runs per week (Zone 2, 3-5 miles each) to maintain your aerobic base. Running fitness decays within 2-3 weeks of stopping.\n\n4. **Start Hyrox station familiarization.** Twice per week, after your Persist sessions, spend 15 minutes practicing one Hyrox station at light weight. Learn the movement patterns: sled push technique, wall ball timing, rowing stroke mechanics.\n\n**Timeline Example**\n\nIf your Hyrox is 22 weeks out:\n- **Weeks 1-6**: Persist Pillars + 3 easy runs + station familiarization\n- **Weeks 7-22**: Full Hyrox-specific training program (16 weeks)\n\nIf your race is less than 16 weeks out, skip Persist entirely. You don't have the luxury of a movement quality block \u2014 go directly into Hyrox training and integrate tempo work into your strength sessions instead.\n\n**Cost**: $39/month or $99 for the 3-month quarter (which covers your 6-week cycle plus buffer). The 2-week free trial lets you evaluate before committing."}]}

The conditioning is integrated at the END of hypertrophy-focused sessions. A typical conditioning finisher looks like:\n\n- Row 12 Cal Sprint \u2192 6 KB Deadlifts (70 lb) \u2192 200 ft KB Farmers Walk \u2192 6 KB Deadlifts \u2192 12 Body Rows\n- Every 3:00 x 4 sets (~2 min work, ~1 min rest per round)\n\nThis is **metabolic conditioning as an accessory to muscle building**. The work periods are short (2-3 min), the total conditioning volume per session is 10-15 minutes, and the primary training stimulus is hypertrophy.\n\n**Nick Bare's Approach: Conditioning Through High Aerobic Volume**\n\nBare builds conditioning through a completely different mechanism: **massive aerobic volume**. At 65 miles/week of running, his cardiovascular system is adapted to sustained, moderate-intensity output for hours. He then layers Hyrox circuit sessions (2x/week) on top of this aerobic base.\n\nHis conditioning comes from:\n- 5-6 running sessions per week (80% easy, 20% quality)\n- 2 Hyrox-specific circuit sessions with sled push, sled pull, wall balls, burpee broad jumps, farmers carry, rowing\n- The combination of high aerobic base + sport-specific circuit work\n\n**The Verdict: Bare's Approach Wins \u2014 Decisively**\n\nHyrox is a **60-90 minute continuous effort**. Persist's conditioning finishers total maybe 10-15 minutes of metabolic work per session with no running component whatsoever. That's fundamentally insufficient for an event that demands sustained aerobic output across 8km of running and 8 functional stations.\n\nBare's approach builds the aerobic engine (through running volume) and the sport-specific capacity (through circuit sessions) simultaneously. His 1:05:42 Pro Division result validates the methodology.\n\n**What to Actually Do**\n\nFollow Bare's concurrent training structure (AM runs / PM strength) but at a volume appropriate for your level:\n\n| Component | Bare's Volume | Your Target |\n|-----------|--------------|-------------|\n| Weekly running | 65 miles | 25-35 miles |\n| Quality runs | 1/week | 1-2/week |\n| Strength sessions | 3/week | 2-3/week |\n| Hyrox circuits | 2/week | 2/week |\n| Total hours | 15+/week | 8-10/week |\n\n**Steal ONE thing from Persist**: Use Pump Condition-style conditioning finishers (KB work, carries, rows) at the end of your 2-3 strength sessions. This adds sport-relevant metabolic work without requiring an extra session. But don't confuse these finishers with actual Hyrox conditioning \u2014 they're supplements, not the main course."}]}

Hyrox readiness: 8/10. Best all-around Hyrox program.\n2. **LEVLS** (official Hyrox partner) \u2014 Progressive methodology with benchmark workouts at all 8 stations. Hyrox readiness: 8/10. Best for station-specific benchmarking.\n3. **Roxlyfe 12-Week Plan** \u2014 Proven with strong user testimonials (3:30-5:30 improvement on race times). Weekly race simulations. Hyrox readiness: 7/10. Best value for a one-time program.\n\n**Tier 2: Adaptable Programs**\n4. **HWPO Hyrox** ($49/month with All Access) \u2014 Fraser's programming applied to Hyrox. 5x/week standalone or 2x/week add-on. Hyrox readiness: 7/10.\n5. **HAOS** ($39.99/month) \u2014 Hunter McIntyre's platform with 4-level progression (Intro \u2192 Strength \u2192 Run \u2192 Pro). Covers multiple sports. Hyrox readiness: 7/10.\n\n**My Specific Recommendation**\n\nStart with **PRVN Hyrox** ($45/month, 7-day free trial). Here's why it's the best next step after BPN:\n\n1. You're already comfortable with daily programming from an app \u2014 PRVN delivers the same way\n2. The 8-week cycle structure gives you clear progression that BPN's static template lacks\n3. Multi-level scaling means the program grows with you\n4. Sled work, station practice, and conditioning are all built in \u2014 the exact gaps BPN left\n5. Running is integrated (unlike Persist) so you don't lose your aerobic base\n\nKeep using BPN for its **running programs** (the 5K/Half Marathon/Marathon plans are solid) and **Garmin integration** for overall training load monitoring. Use PRVN Hyrox for your primary Hyrox-specific training. The combination gives you structured running periodization (BPN) plus sport-specific Hyrox preparation (PRVN) at a total cost of $45/month."}]}

Running goes from 6-8 to ~12 miles/week by week 4 (extend those 3-mile runs to 4 miles as they feel comfortable).\n\n**Phase 2: Weeks 5-8 (Introduce Two-a-Days \u2014 2x/Week)**\n\n| Day | AM (30-40 min) | PM (45-60 min) |\n|-----|---------------|----------------|\n| Mon | Easy run 4 mi | \u2014 |\n| Tue | \u2014 | Strength \u2014 Upper body |\n| Wed | **Easy run 4 mi** | **Hyrox station practice** |\n| Thu | \u2014 | Strength \u2014 Lower body |\n| Fri | **Tempo run 4 mi** | **Hyrox station practice** |\n| Sat | Long run 5-6 mi | \u2014 |\n| Sun | Rest | \u2014 |\n\n**Two-a-days: Wednesday and Friday only.** Weekly running: ~17 miles.

Increase calories by 300-500/day when you add two-a-days.\n3. **If energy drops, cut volume immediately.** Better to lose one session than to grind through a week of trash training.\n4. **Bare's auto-regulation principle**: If your AM run felt unusually hard, reduce PM session intensity. The sessions interact.\n\nThe whole ramp takes 12-16 weeks. Don't rush it \u2014 Bare built to 65 miles/week over 5 years. You're building to 25-35 miles/week over 4 months.

The mobility programming is arguably Filly's best contribution, and it's designed to be a standalone component.\n\n**What Persist's Mobility Includes**\n\nPersist programs 2-3 dedicated mobility sessions per week across all tracks. These aren't generic \"stretch for 10 minutes\" \u2014 they're structured sessions that target specific movement patterns and joint systems. Filly's approach to mobility comes from his post-burnout recovery philosophy: mobility is a **non-negotiable training component**, not an optional afterthought.\n\nThe mobility sessions integrate:\n- Joint-specific mobility drills (ankle, hip, thoracic spine)\n- Active stretching under load (not just passive holds)\n- Movement flow sequences\n- Breathing and nervous system regulation work\n\n**How This Helps Your Hyrox Training**\n\nHyrox is brutally demanding on specific joint systems:\n- **Ankles**: Wall balls (deep squat + overhead press), lunges, running 8km\n- **Hips**: Sled push (hip extension), rowing (hip hinge), burpee broad jumps\n- **Thoracic spine**: Overhead position in wall balls, ski erg pull, farmer carry posture\n- **Shoulders**: Wall balls, ski erg, sled pull\n\nRestrictions in any of these areas create compensatory movement patterns that cost you time and increase injury risk.\n\nWhat does your current mobility practice look like?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Honestly, nothing.

Poor hip mobility means a shorter stride on sled pushes and less power on the rower. This isn't theoretical \u2014 it directly affects your race time.\n\n**Here's How to Steal Persist's Mobility Without the Full Program**\n\n**Option 1: Subscribe to Persist ($39/month) and Only Follow the Mobility Track**\n\nAll tracks include 2-3 mobility sessions/week. You'd log in, do only those sessions, and ignore the strength/hypertrophy work. Each mobility session is ~30-40 minutes. This gives you professionally programmed, progressive mobility work that evolves over 6-week cycles.\n\nCost-effective? Debatable at $39/month for just the mobility component. But the programming quality is excellent.\n\n**Option 2: Build Your Own Persist-Inspired Mobility Protocol (Free)**\n\nStructure 3 sessions per week, 20-25 minutes each. Integrate them as follows:\n\n| Day | When | Hyrox-Specific Mobility Focus |\n|-----|------|------------------------------|\n| **Mon** | Post-training or separate AM session | **Lower body**: Ankle dorsiflexion (wall ankle stretches 2x45s/side), hip flexor stretch with elevated rear foot (2x60s/side), deep squat hold with load (2x60s), single-leg RDL balance holds (3x30s/side) |\n| **Wed** | Post-training or separate AM session | **Upper body + spine**: Thoracic spine extensions over foam roller (2x60s), shoulder CARs (10 circles each direction), lat stretch at rig (2x45s/side), banded chest opener (2x45s) |\n| **Fri** | Post-training or separate AM session | **Full body flow**: World's greatest stretch complex (5 reps/side), Cossack squat progressions (3x8/side), bear crawl to downward dog (5 transitions), 90/90 hip switches (2x10) |\n\n**The Persist Principle to Embed**\n\nFilly treats mobility as **training, not recovery.** That mindset shift matters:\n- Program it on your calendar like a strength session \u2014 it doesn't happen if it's optional\n- Track it \u2014 note improvements in range of motion over weeks\n- Load it \u2014 ankle and hip mobility drills should progress from bodyweight to lightly loaded (holding a KB in a goblet squat hold, for example)\n\nStart with Option 2 immediately \u2014 it takes 20 minutes and requires zero equipment. If you find value after 4 weeks, consider subscribing to Persist for the full mobility programming. The $39/month becomes worth it when you realize your wall ball pace improved because your squat depth increased, or your sled push feels stronger because your hip extension opened up."}]}

Let me explain why.\n\n**The 80/20 Principle in Bare's Programming**\n\nLook at his Hyrox-phase training split: out of 6 running days, **4 are easy-pace efforts** (Monday 10 easy miles, Thursday 10 easy miles, Friday 8 easy miles, Sunday 8-10 easy miles). Only **1 is a quality session** (Wednesday tempo/track workout). Saturday's long run is also Zone 2.\n\nThat's approximately an **83/17 easy-to-hard distribution** \u2014 textbook polarized training. And this is a guy who ran a 2:48 marathon and finished 9th in Hyrox Pro.\n\n**Why Easy Running Feels \"Wrong\" But Isn't**\n\nThe research is unambiguous:\n- Seiler & Kjerland (2006): World and Olympic champions spend 75-80% of training at low intensity\n- St\u00f6ggl & Sperlich (2014): After 9 weeks, the polarized group showed superior improvements in 10K time, VO2 max, running economy, AND lactate threshold compared to threshold-only training\n\nEasy running builds your aerobic engine \u2014 mitochondrial density, capillary networks, fat oxidation efficiency, cardiac output. These adaptations only happen at low intensity. Running harder doesn't build them faster; it just adds fatigue.\n\nTell me more about your current running structure \u2014 how many days, what paces, and what distances?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I run 5 days a week, about 25 miles total. But honestly most of my runs are at like a 'moderate' effort \u2014 I'm breathing hard but not gasping. Maybe 1 tempo run and 1 interval session."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There's your problem \u2014 and it's the classic mistake. You're running in the **\"gray zone\"** (Zone 3, moderate effort, breathing hard but sustainable). This is the worst place to spend most of your training time.\n\n**The Gray Zone Problem**\n\n- Too hard to build aerobic base (those adaptations happen at Zone 1-2, conversational pace)\n- Too easy to develop top-end speed (that happens at Zone 4-5, near-max effort)\n- Generates significant fatigue without proportional fitness gains\n- Compromises your strength training and Hyrox station work by accumulating unnecessary stress\n\nYou said you have 1 tempo run and 1 interval session. Those should be your ONLY hard runs. The other 3 runs should be genuinely easy \u2014 **you should be able to hold a full conversation**, not just \"sort of talk between breaths.\"\n\n**Your Fixed Running Distribution**\n\nAt 25 miles/week with 5 runs:\n\n| Run | Day | Distance | Intensity | Pace Guide |\n|-----|-----|----------|-----------|------------|\n| Easy 1 | Mon | 4 mi | Zone 2 | Can tell a story without pausing |\n| Tempo | Wed | 5 mi | 1.5 mi easy \u2192 2 mi @ 75-85% HR \u2192 1.5 mi easy | \"Short sentences only\" during tempo portion |\n| Easy 2 | Thu | 4 mi | Zone 2 | Conversational |\n| Intervals | Fri | 5 mi | 1.5 mi warm-up \u2192 5x3 min @ 90-95% HR w/ 2 min jog \u2192 1.5 mi cool-down | Gasping during intervals is correct |\n| Long Easy | Sat | 7 mi | Zone 2 | Slowest comfortable pace |\n\n**Total: 25 miles. Easy: 15 miles (60%). Hard: 10 miles (40%).**\n\nHonestly, that's still too much intensity for the 80/20 model (should be 80% easy / 20% hard). The reason I'm prescribing 60/40 is because your Hyrox station work also counts as high-intensity training. When you add 2 Hyrox circuit sessions per week into the \"hard\" bucket, your overall training distribution gets closer to 75/25, which is acceptable.\n\n**The Practical Test**\n\nFor your next easy run, deliberately slow down by 60-90 seconds per mile from your current \"moderate\" pace. It should feel embarrassingly slow. If someone passed you, you'd feel self-conscious. **That's the correct pace.** After 3-4 weeks of truly easy running, you'll notice two things:\n1.

Let me walk through each and explain why.\n\n**The Ranking for Hyrox Athletes**\n\n**1st: Pillars (4 days/week, 60 min) \u2014 This Is Your Answer**\n\nPillars focuses on compound lifts (squat, bench, deadlift, OHP) with conditioning finishers including EMOMs, AMRAPs, and burnout sets. Here's why it works:\n\n- **4 days/week at 60 minutes** \u2014 the lowest time commitment, leaving room for your running and Hyrox station work\n- **Compound lifts** build the strength foundation for sled push (squat/deadlift), sled pull (deadlift/row), lunges (squat), and wall balls (squat + press)\n- **Conditioning finishers included** \u2014 you're not just doing pure strength; you get metabolic work that maintains your engine\n- **6-week cycles with progressive overload** \u2014 structured periodization that complements your Hyrox training block\n\nThe session architecture transfers perfectly: Pre-Fatigue (warm-up with light rowing or running) \u2192 Strength Intensity (back squat at 30X1 tempo, building to RPE 8) \u2192 Strength Balance (single-leg accessories like Bulgarian split squats) \u2192 Conditioning Finisher (modify this to use Hyrox station movements instead of Persist's default exercises).\n\n**2nd: Pump Condition (5 days/week, 75 min) \u2014 Too Much Volume**\n\nThe conditioning integration is better, but 5 days at 75 minutes doesn't leave enough room for dedicated running and Hyrox practice. If Hyrox training is your priority, Pump Condition's time demand creates scheduling conflicts.\n\n**3rd-5th: Not Recommended**\n- **Pump Lift** (no conditioning at all \u2014 you need metabolic work)\n- **Perform** (90-min sessions with Olympic lifts \u2014 too long, wrong movements)\n- **Minimalist** (designed for home gyms with limited equipment \u2014 you need access to barbells and sleds)\n\n**How to Integrate Pillars into a Hyrox Week**\n\n| Day | AM | PM |\n|-----|-----|----|\n| Mon | Easy run 4 mi | **Persist Pillars A** (Squat emphasis) |\n| Tue | Tempo run 5 mi | \u2014 |\n| Wed | \u2014 | **Persist Pillars B** (Press emphasis) |\n| Thu | Easy run 4 mi | Hyrox station practice |\n| Fri | \u2014 | **Persist Pillars C** (Deadlift emphasis) |\n| Sat | Hyrox simulation (run + stations) | \u2014 |\n| Sun | **Persist Mobility Session** | Rest |\n\nYou'd follow 3 of the 4 Pillars sessions (dropping the 4th to fit your schedule) and use Sunday for Persist's dedicated mobility work. The tempo prescriptions in Pillars (RPE-based, auto-regulating) naturally adjust when you're fatigued from running \u2014 you'll lift lighter on tired days without abandoning the program structure.\n\n**Cost analysis**: At $39/month (or $99/quarter), you're getting structured strength programming with built-in periodization and mobility. Compare that to $45/month for PRVN Hyrox or $49/month for HWPO All Access. If you pair Pillars with a separate Hyrox-specific plan (even a free one), the total investment is reasonable."}]}

Weekly running: ~65 miles/week. Bare finished 9th in Hyrox Pro Division in Dallas with 1:05:42 (top 8% of all-time Pro times). Analysis showed he lost time on sled pull, burpees, rowing, and wall balls \u2014 the more technical Hyrox-specific movements. His running and carry stations were strong. Bare's philosophy: \"Stimulate, don't obliterate.\" Two-a-days as default. \"Don't add \u2014 replace\" when incorporating running. Start with 4 training days minimum, held for 4 weeks before adding sessions.\n---"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Nick Bare got 9th at Hyrox Pro. Where did he lose time and what would you change about his program?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Bare's 1:05:42 at the Dallas Hyrox Pro Division \u2014 9th out of 207, top 8% of all-time Pro times \u2014 is a legitimately impressive debut. But the data reveals clear patterns about where his hybrid approach fell short and what an optimized program would fix.\n\n**Where Bare Lost Time**\n\nAnalysis of his race result shows he underperformed at:\n1. **Sled pull** \u2014 despite massive posterior chain strength from deadlifts and rows\n2. **Burpee broad jumps** \u2014 technique and pacing-specific\n3. **Rowing** \u2014 despite general aerobic fitness\n4. **Wall balls** \u2014 despite leg strength\n\nHis **running splits and farmer carry** were strong \u2014 exactly what you'd expect from a 65-mile/week runner with serious strength training.\n\n**The Diagnosis**\n\nBare's weaknesses are all **Hyrox-specific technical movements**. His program has only 2 Hyrox circuit sessions per week, and these circuits rotate through all 8 stations. That means each individual station gets practiced roughly **once per week** \u2014 insufficient volume for technical mastery.\n\nThe pattern is clear: his enormous aerobic base and general strength carried the running and carry stations. But the stations requiring Hyrox-specific technique (sled pull hand position, burpee broad jump efficiency, rowing pace management, wall ball rhythm) exposed the gap between general fitness and sport-specific preparation.\n\n**What I'd Change \u2014 3 Specific Modifications**\n\n**1. Increase Hyrox Circuit Frequency from 2x to 3-4x/Week**\n\nReplace one of the easy run days (Sunday's 8-10 miles is an obvious candidate) with a dedicated station practice session. Add a second dedicated session by splitting the current circuits into focused station blocks rather than full-circuit rotations.\n\nNew station practice structure:\n- **Monday PM**: Hyrox circuit (full rotation \u2014 all 8 stations)\n- **Thursday PM**: Hyrox circuit (full rotation)\n- **Saturday AM**: Weakness-focused station work \u2014 45 min dedicated to sled pull, wall balls, and rowing ONLY\n\n**2. Reduce Running Volume from 65 to 40-45 Miles/Week**\n\nBare's running volume reflects his marathon/ultra background, not Hyrox optimization. Hyrox has only 8km of total running. His running splits were already strong \u2014 more miles won't help. Redirecting 20 miles/week of running into station practice creates more Hyrox-specific improvement.\n\nNew weekly running: 4 runs instead of 6-7\n- Monday: 6 easy miles (down from 10)\n- Wednesday: Tempo/track 8 miles (down from 10-12)\n- Friday: 5 easy miles (down from 8)\n- Saturday: Long run 8 miles (down from 15+)\n\n**3. Add Strength-Endurance Work for Weak Stations**\n\nBare's lower body strength day (Wednesday PM) should include Hyrox-specific strength-endurance rather than traditional bodybuilding:\n- **Replace hack squats** with wall balls 5x20 at race weight (10 min EMOM)\n- **Replace leg extensions** with sled pull technique work 6x50m\n- **Add rowing intervals**: 5x500m at race target split with 90s rest\n\nThese changes would address his specific weaknesses while preserving the concurrent training framework and \"stimulate, don't obliterate\" philosophy that clearly works for him. His aerobic base is already world-class \u2014 now it's about converting general fitness into sport-specific performance at the stations that cost him a top-5 finish."}]}

No sled push/pull, no wall balls, no burpee broad jumps, no ski erg, no rowing for distance, no farmer carries, no sandbag lunges. After 12 weeks of BPN, you'll have a good aerobic base and general strength \u2014 but you won't have practiced a single Hyrox station.\n\n**Your Full 24-Week Plan**\n\n**Phase 1: BPN Hybrid Athlete (Weeks 1-12)**\n- Follow the program as written\n- Focus on consistency and learning movement patterns\n- Build to running 15-20 miles/week comfortably\n- Build basic strength across all movement patterns\n- **Starting Week 8**: Begin visiting a gym with sleds, rowers, and ski ergs. Practice each Hyrox station once per week with light weight, just to learn the movements.\n\n**Phase 2: Hyrox-Specific Training (Weeks 13-22)**\n- Keep 2 BPN strength sessions per week (maintenance)\n- Keep 3 runs per week from BPN (easy, tempo, long)\n- Replace 2 BPN sessions with Hyrox station practice:\n  - Station Day A: Sled push + wall balls + rowing\n  - Station Day B: Sled pull + farmer carry + burpee broad jumps\n- Add 1 weekly race simulation starting Week 16: 1km run \u2192 station \u2192 1km run \u2192 station (build from 3 to 8 stations over 6 weeks)\n- Progress station loads toward race weight by Week 20\n\n**Phase 3: Taper (Weeks 23-24)**\n- Reduce volume 40%. Maintain 2 easy runs, 1 light station practice\n- Practice race-day nutrition and warm-up routine\n- Rest and trust your preparation\n\nBPN gives you the chassis.

Here's the exact translation from CrossFit to Hyrox:\n\n**What Your CrossFit Background Already Gives You**\n- Work capacity across time domains (Hyrox is a 60-90 min chipper)\n- Familiarity with wall balls, rowing, ski erg, sleds, carries, and burpees\n- Mental toughness from Hero WODs and long chippers\n- Metabolic conditioning across phosphocreatine, glycolytic, and oxidative energy systems\n- Movement standards and quality under fatigue\n\n**The 5 Specific Changes You Must Make**\n\n**1. Add Dedicated Running \u2014 This Is Non-Negotiable**\n\nCrossFit programs 200m-1600m runs within WODs. Hyrox has **8km of total running** between stations. Mat Fraser himself admitted after his first Hyrox: \"The stations I was keeping up just fine. But on the running, there were a couple times I was like, 'O'Keefe, chill.'\"\n\nAdd 3-4 runs per week:\n- 2 easy runs (4-6 mi, Zone 2 \u2014 conversational pace)\n- 1 tempo run (4-5 mi with 2-3 mi at 75-85% max HR)\n- 1 long run (7-10 mi, Zone 2 \u2014 build over 8 weeks)\n\n**2. Replace Olympic Lifting with Station Practice**\n\nSnatches, cleans, and jerks have **zero Hyrox transfer**. Every minute you spend on a snatch complex is a minute not spent practicing sled push technique, wall ball pacing, or rowing efficiency. Redirect that training time to:\n- Sled push 4x50m at race weight (152kg men / 102kg women)\n- Sled pull 4x50m at race weight (103kg men / 78kg women)\n- Burpee broad jumps 4x20m for technique and pacing\n- Wall balls in sets of 100 (race volume, race target height)\n\n**3. Drop Complex Gymnastics**\n\nMuscle-ups, handstand walks, chest-to-bar pull-ups, toes-to-bar \u2014 none appear in Hyrox. Time spent on gymnastics skills is time stolen from sport-specific preparation.\n\n**4. Learn Pacing \u2014 CrossFit Rewards Intensity, Hyrox Punishes It**\n\nIn CrossFit, going all-out usually pays off. In Hyrox, redlining on the sled push means your next 1km run falls apart, which means your rowing pace drops, which cascades through the rest of the race. Practice:\n- Compromised running \u2014 run 1km immediately after a heavy station. Learn what your legs feel like and how to pace through it.\n- Race simulation \u2014 do 4-8 stations with 1km runs between. Practice even pacing, not negative splitting.\n\n**5. Build Aerobic Base with Zone 2 Work**\n\nCrossFit rarely programs dedicated low-intensity aerobic sessions. Your VO2 max is probably strong, but your aerobic base (mitochondrial density, fat oxidation, cardiac output at low intensity) may be underdeveloped. Add 2-3 sessions per week at Zone 2 heart rate \u2014 this is the foundation that determines how well you recover between stations.\n\n**What to Keep from CrossFit**\n- The chipper and EMOM conditioning formats (repopulated with Hyrox movements)\n- The scaling methodology\n- Benchmark testing for progress tracking\n- The competitive intensity on hard training days"}]}

Here's how to repurpose them:\n\n**Why EMOMs Work for Hyrox**\n\nThe EMOM format creates forced work-rest intervals. In Hyrox, you finish a 1km run, immediately hit a station, work through it, then immediately start the next 1km run. The ability to sustain output across repeated intervals with brief transitions IS the Hyrox skill \u2014 and EMOMs train exactly that.\n\n**5 Hyrox-Specific EMOM Workouts**\n\n**EMOM 1: Station Rotation (40 minutes)**\n- Min 1: Row 15/12 calories\n- Min 2: 15 Wall Balls (20/14 lb to race-height target)\n- Min 3: Sled Push 25m (race weight)\n- Min 4: Rest\n- *Repeat 10 rounds*\n\nThis mimics the sustained 40+ minute effort of Hyrox with varied movement demands. The rest minute simulates the brief transition between running and stations.\n\n**EMOM 2: Running + Station Couplet (24 minutes)**\n- Min 1-2: 400m Run\n- Min 3: 12 Burpee Broad Jumps\n- *Repeat 8 rounds*\n\nTeaches compromised running (running immediately after burpees) and pacing across repeated efforts. Total running: 3.2km \u2014 meaningful aerobic stimulus.\n\n**EMOM 3: Strength-Endurance (20 minutes)**\n- Every 2:00 x 10 sets, alternating:\n  - Odd sets: Sled Pull 50m (race weight)\n  - Even sets: Farmer Carry 100m (32/24 kg per hand)\n\nBuilds the grip and posterior chain endurance needed for the back-to-back carry and sled stations in Hyrox.\n\n**EMOM 4: Race Pace Wall Balls (10 minutes)**\n- Every 1:00 x 10 sets: 10 Wall Balls (race weight, race height)\n- *Target: unbroken every round*\n\nThis is 100 wall balls in 10 minutes \u2014 exactly the race volume. The EMOM format forces consistent pacing rather than starting fast and dying. If you can hold 10 unbroken every minute, you're looking at a ~6-minute wall ball station.\n\n**EMOM 5: The Full Hyrox Simulation EMOM (48 minutes)**\n- Every 6:00 x 8 rounds:\n  - Run 1km\n  - In remaining time: complete one Hyrox station (rotate through all 8)\n  - *Score: total time remaining per round*\n\nThis is the ultimate EMOM for Hyrox prep. Each 6-minute window forces you to run the kilometer AND complete the station work. As the rounds progress and fatigue accumulates, managing the time window becomes the challenge \u2014 exactly like race day.\n\n**Programming EMOM Frequency**\n\nInclude 2-3 EMOM-format workouts per week in your Hyrox prep. Vary the duration (10-40+ min) and the movement selection across the week. The format teaches pacing discipline that long AMRAPs don't \u2014 because the clock resets every minute, you can't hide behind a slow pace."}]}

That's 2.5x the running volume, spread throughout the race rather than bookended.\n\nIf your only running experience is Murph and WOD running (200m-1600m pieces), you have:\n- Good anaerobic running capacity (you can run fast for short distances)\n- Good running-under-fatigue tolerance (from the second Murph mile)\n- **Insufficient aerobic running volume** for sustained 1km pacing across 8 segments\n- **No Zone 2 running base** \u2014 the mitochondrial density and cardiac efficiency that prevents your late-race running pace from collapsing\n\n**Your Conversion Plan**\n\n**Phase 1: Build the Aerobic Base (Weeks 1-6)**\n\nYou need to become comfortable running 20-25 miles per week. Start here:\n\n- **Monday**: Easy run 3-4 miles (Zone 2 \u2014 conversational pace. This will feel painfully slow. That's correct.)\n- **Wednesday**: Easy run 3-4 miles (Zone 2)\n- **Friday**: Moderate run 4-5 miles (Zone 2-3)\n- **Sunday**: Long run \u2014 start at 5 miles, add 0.5 miles per week, build to 8 miles\n\nTotal: ~15-18 miles/week, building to 20-22 miles/week by Week 6.\n\n**Phase 2: Add Quality (Weeks 7-12)**\n\nNow add intensity on top of the base:\n- Replace Wednesday with a **tempo run**: 5 miles total (1.5 mi easy, 2 mi at tempo pace where you can only speak in short sentences, 1.5 mi easy)\n- Replace Friday with **VO2 max intervals**: 6 miles total (1.5 mi warm-up, 5 x 4 min at 90-95% max HR with 3 min jog recovery, 1.5 mi cool-down)\n- Keep Monday easy and Sunday long\n\nTotal: 20-25 miles/week with 2 quality sessions.\n\n**Phase 3: Hyrox-Specific Running (Weeks 13-16)**\n\nAdd **compromised running** \u2014 running immediately after station work:\n- Saturday: Hyrox simulation \u2014 4 stations with 1km runs between each. Focus on consistent split times across all four 1km segments.\n- The goal: your 4th 1km run should be within 15 seconds of your 1st.\n\n**Murph as a Training Tool**\n\nKeep doing Murph-style workouts monthly \u2014 they're excellent Hyrox prep. Modify the format: instead of 1 mile + bodyweight + 1 mile, do **4 x (1km run + 150 reps of mixed bodyweight)**. This simulates the repeated run-station-run pattern better than the original Murph structure."}]}

Here's exactly how to shift your approach:\n\n**CrossFit Sled Work**\n- Typically programmed in accessories or conditioning finishers\n- Short distances (25-50 ft / 7-15m)\n- Heavy loads (often maximal or near-maximal)\n- Sprint effort \u2014 go as fast as possible\n- Recovery between sets\n- Focus on power output\n\n**Hyrox Sled Work**\n- **Sled Push**: 50 meters at 152kg (men) / 102kg (women)\n- **Sled Pull**: 50 meters at 103kg (men) / 78kg (women)\n- These come AFTER running 1km (sled push after the 3rd km, sled pull after the 4th km)\n- You then immediately run another 1km after each sled station\n- The load is moderate \u2014 not maximal. But sustained over 50 meters after cardiovascular stress\n- Focus shifts from power to **strength-endurance and pacing**\n\n**The 5 Key Differences in Training Approach**\n\n**1. Distance \u2014 Train the Full 50m**\n\nCrossFit sled pushes are often 25-50 feet. Hyrox is 50 meters (164 feet). That's 3-4x longer than a typical CrossFit prescription. Train at the full distance or you'll be blindsided by the sustained effort.\n\nPrescription: 4-6 x 50m sled push at race weight, 2-3 min rest between sets.\n\n**2. Pacing, Not Sprinting**\n\nIn CrossFit, you attack the sled with maximal effort because the distance is short. In Hyrox, sprinting the sled push will destroy your next 1km run. You need to find a **sustainable push pace** \u2014 consistent speed, controlled breathing, no redlining.\n\nDrill: Push the sled 50m at 3 different paces (sprint, moderate, controlled). Then immediately run 400m after each. Compare your run times. You'll discover that the controlled sled push + run combo is FASTER than the sprint push + demolished run.\n\n**3. Technique Over Brute Force**\n\nCrossFit sled pushes are often low-handle, all-out drives. For Hyrox, focus on:\n- High handle position for better leg drive angles over distance\n- Short, powerful steps (not long lunging strides that fatigue your quads)\n- Hip extension \u2014 drive through the glutes, not the quads\n- Rhythmic breathing \u2014 exhale on each push step\n\n**4. Sled Pull Is a Different Beast**\n\nHyrox sled pull uses a rope \u2014 you're not dragging it backward. You plant your feet, pull the rope hand-over-hand, and the sled slides toward you. This is a **posterior chain and grip endurance** movement, not a leg exercise.\n\nTrain it specifically: 4-6 x 50m sled pull (rope, seated or standing), race weight. Focus on efficient hand-over-hand technique, maintaining a strong base position, and managing grip fatigue.\n\n**5. Compromised Context**\n\nIn CrossFit, you do sled work fresh or after a few minutes of other work. In Hyrox, you arrive at the sled after running 3-4km and completing 2-3 other stations. Your heart rate is 160+, your legs are pre-fatigued, your grip may already be compromised.\n\nDrill: Run 1km at race pace \u2192 immediately sled push 50m \u2192 run another 1km. Repeat for sled pull. Learn what it feels like to push/pull with tired legs and an elevated heart rate. This is the skill that separates CrossFit athletes who \"finish\" Hyrox from those who compete."}]}

Here's the definitive list:\n\n**Tier 1: Directly Transferable (Keep These)**\n\n**1. Murph** \u2014 1-mile run, 100 pull-ups, 200 push-ups, 300 air squats, 1-mile run (20-lb vest)\n- **Why it transfers**: Bookended runs with high-volume bodyweight work builds run-under-fatigue capacity. Time domain (35-60+ min) matches Hyrox race duration. The vest adds load management.\n- **Hyrox modification**: Replace pull-ups with wall balls, push-ups with burpee broad jumps. Run the miles as 4 x 400m with work between each run.\n\n**2. Filthy Fifty** \u2014 50 reps each of 10 different exercises, for time\n- **Why it transfers**: This chipper format teaches athletes to manage effort across multiple stations, pacing through varied movement demands \u2014 the fundamental Hyrox skill.\n- **Hyrox modification**: Replace the 10 exercises with Hyrox-specific movements: 50 cal row, 50 wall balls, 50m sled push, 50 burpee broad jumps, etc.\n\n**3. Chad** \u2014 1,000 box step-ups with a 20-lb vest\n- **Why it transfers**: Sustained muscular endurance and mental fortitude through monotonous, high-volume single-movement work. Directly applicable to 100 wall balls or 100m sandbag lunges.\n- **Hyrox modification**: Replace box step-ups with 1,000m of walking lunges (with or without sandbag).\n\n**4. Glen** \u2014 30 clean-and-jerks, 1-mile run, 10 rope climbs, 1-mile run, 100 burpees, 1-mile run\n- **Why it transfers**: The alternating run-and-work structure is remarkably similar to Hyrox's format. Three 1-mile runs with functional work between each.\n- **Hyrox modification**: Replace clean-and-jerks with sled push, rope climbs with sled pull, keep the burpees (add broad jumps).\n\n**Tier 2: Partially Transferable (Modify These)**\n\n**5. Nancy** \u2014 5 rounds: 400m run + 15 overhead squats (95/65)\n- Running + squatting under fatigue. Replace OHS with wall balls.\n\n**6. Helen** \u2014 3 rounds: 400m run + 21 KB swings + 12 pull-ups\n- Good running-to-work transition practice. Replace pull-ups with farmer carries.\n\n**Tier 3: Not Transferable (Drop These)**\n\n- **Fran** (thrusters + pull-ups): Too short (2-5 min), wrong movements\n- **Grace** (30 clean-and-jerks): Olympic lifting with no Hyrox transfer\n- **Isabel** (30 snatches): Same problem\n- **Diane** (deadlifts + HSPUs): Handstand push-ups are irrelevant\n- **King Kong** (heavy complex): Too strength-focused, wrong movements\n\n**How to Program Benchmarks into Hyrox Prep**\n\nTrain 1 benchmark WOD per week \u2014 always from Tier 1 or modified Tier 2. Use it as your Saturday \"test\" piece:\n- Week 1: Modified Murph\n- Week 2: Modified Filthy Fifty\n- Week 3: Full Hyrox simulation (not a benchmark)\n- Week 4: Modified Glen\n- Repeat the cycle, tracking improvement across attempts.\n\nThis keeps the competitive CrossFit energy you love while directing it toward Hyrox-specific outcomes."}]}

What's the minimum running I need to do for Hyrox?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I hear this from CrossFitters constantly, and I'm going to be direct: you can hate running all you want, but you can't escape the fact that **running accounts for roughly 50% of your total Hyrox race time**. The running between stations is where most CrossFit athletes lose their competitive edge.\n\n**The Minimum Effective Running Dose for Hyrox**\n\n**3 runs per week. Non-negotiable. Here's the structure:**\n\n**Run 1: Zone 2 Long Run (45-60 min, once per week)**\n- Distance: 5-7 miles at conversational pace\n- Purpose: Builds your aerobic engine \u2014 mitochondrial density, capillary networks, cardiac efficiency\n- This is the run that determines how well you recover between stations on race day\n- Pace: You should be able to hold a full conversation. If you can't, slow down.\n\n**Run 2: Tempo Run (30-40 min, once per week)**\n- Structure: 1.5 mi warm-up \u2192 2-3 mi at 75-85% max HR \u2192 1 mi cool-down\n- Purpose: Raises lactate threshold. This pace approximates your average Hyrox running pace between stations.\n- Intensity: \"Short sentences only\" on the talk test\n\n**Run 3: Compromised Running (integrated with station work, once per week)**\n- Structure: Run 1km \u2192 complete one Hyrox station \u2192 run 1km \u2192 complete another station \u2192 run 1km\n- Purpose: This is the most Hyrox-specific run you can do. It teaches pacing under the unique fatigue of transitioning from a heavy station to running. This is the skill that pure running programs miss and CrossFit never trains.\n- Intensity: Race pace effort\n\n**Total weekly minimum: ~12-15 miles**\n\nIs this optimal? No \u2014 competitive Hyrox athletes run 25-40 miles per week. But 12-15 miles with the right distribution (one base builder, one threshold developer, one sport-specific session) will get a strong CrossFitter through the race without the running destroying them.\n\n**How to Make Running Suck Less**\n\n1. **Slow your easy runs way down.** Most CrossFitters run their easy runs at moderate effort, which makes every run feel like a grind. True Zone 2 running should feel almost too easy. Your ego will hate it. Your aerobic system will love it.\n\n2. **Run with a purpose.** Every run has a specific physiological target. You're not just \"going for a run\" \u2014 you're building your lactate threshold or developing your aerobic base. Think of it like a strength session for your cardiovascular system.\n\n3. **Combine running with station work.** The compromised running session (Run 3) lets you train running and stations in the same session. It's efficient and more interesting than a straight 5-mile run.\n\n4. **Listen to podcasts or music on easy runs.** Zone 2 effort is low enough that entertainment doesn't compromise the training effect.\n\nThe math is simple: 8km of running, 8 functional stations. You can't be excellent at the stations and terrible at the running and expect a good time. Three runs per week, 12-15 miles \u2014 that's the minimum. Commit to it."}]}

We do wall balls in WODs but never 100 unbroken."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is one of the biggest CrossFit-to-Hyrox translation challenges. In CrossFit, wall balls appear in mixed-modal WODs \u2014 maybe 30-50 reps among other movements. In Hyrox, it's **100 reps at a stretch** (20 lb men / 14 lb women, 10 ft / 9 ft target) after you've already completed 7 other stations and run 7km. The approach needs to be completely different.\n\n**The CrossFit Wall Ball Mistake**\n\nIn CrossFit, you sprint wall balls \u2014 fast cycle time, minimal rest, because the set is short and you're transitioning to another movement. Applying this to 100 Hyrox wall balls will wreck you. Athletes who go out too fast hit the wall around rep 60-70, their pace collapses, and they lose 1-2 minutes compared to a paced approach.\n\n**The Hyrox Wall Ball Strategy**\n\n**Pacing Protocol: Sets of 10-15 with 3-5 breath breaks**\n\nFor most athletes targeting 4-6 minutes for the wall ball station:\n- Break the 100 into sets of 10-15 reps\n- Take 3-5 deep breaths between sets (approximately 8-12 seconds)\n- Maintain consistent cycle time throughout\n- Never go to muscular failure\n\nFor advanced athletes targeting sub-4 minutes:\n- Sets of 20-25 with 2-3 breath breaks\n- Or full unbroken if your threshold allows it\n\n**Training Protocol**\n\nBuild wall ball endurance progressively over 8-12 weeks:\n\n**Weeks 1-4: Volume Accumulation**\n- 3 x 30 wall balls with 60s rest between sets (total: 90)\n- Focus: Consistent cycle time, proper depth, full hip extension on each throw\n- RPE: 6-7 \u2014 don't chase speed yet\n\n**Weeks 5-8: Race Volume at Pace**\n- 100 wall balls for time, using your planned pacing strategy\n- Example: 10 sets of 10 with 5-breath breaks\n- Track your total time. Target: sub-5 minutes for intermediate, sub-4 for competitive\n- Do this 1-2x per week\n\n**Weeks 9-12: Compromised Wall Balls**\n- Run 1km \u2192 100 wall balls for time\n- This is the real test \u2014 your legs are pre-fatigued from running, your heart rate is elevated, and the squat portion becomes significantly harder\n- Track the difference between fresh and compromised wall ball times. Goal: less than 30 seconds slower when compromised.\n\n**Technique Adjustments for Hyrox**\n\n1. **Squat depth matters**: Use a medicine ball target on the floor \u2014 touch it with your hip crease on each rep to ensure consistent depth. Inconsistent depth leads to no-reps and wasted energy.\n\n2. **Catch position**: Absorb the ball in a partial squat, immediately descend into the next rep. Don't catch standing and then squat \u2014 that's an extra movement.\n\n3. **Breathing rhythm**: Exhale on the throw, inhale on the catch. This becomes automatic after practicing 100-rep sets.\n\n4. **Target accuracy**: Hitting the target consistently saves energy. Off-target throws require corrections that accumulate fatigue over 100 reps.\n\nAs CrossFit's own article notes, \"We invented the wall-ball shot.\" Use that familiarity to your advantage \u2014 but respect the volume difference between a CrossFit WOD and the Hyrox standard."}]}

Let me give you both workaround options and the argument for finding access to actual sleds.\n\n**Priority 1: Find Sled Access**\n\nBefore we discuss alternatives, let me be clear: the sled push and sled pull are consistently rated as the **hardest and most impactful stations** in Hyrox. They're the stations where athletes lose the most time and where the biggest performance gains are available. If you can find ANY way to access a sled on a turf track, do it.\n\nOptions:\n- Specialty Hyrox gyms or affiliate programs (PRVN, HWPO, and many CrossFit boxes now have Hyrox equipment)\n- Globo gyms with turf areas (increasingly common)\n- Outdoor parking lots with a sled and 50m of concrete (not ideal, but functional)\n- Weekend sessions at a different facility that has sleds\n\nEven once per week on actual sleds will teach you the movement pattern and pacing better than any substitute.\n\n**Priority 2: Best Substitutes**\n\n**For Sled Push:**\n\n1. **Heavy Prowler/Plate Push on Smooth Floor** \u2014 if your gym has any pushing sled and smooth flooring, load it to race weight and push 50m\n2. **Wall Push Isometric** \u2014 lean against a wall in sled push position, drive as hard as possible for 30-45 seconds x 4-6 sets. This builds the specific leg drive pattern.\n3. **Barbell Hack Squats + Walking Lunges** \u2014 superset 4x8 hack squats with 4x50m walking lunges. Not the same movement, but builds the specific quad/glute endurance the sled demands.\n4. **Heavy Leg Press (high rep)** \u2014 3x30 at moderate weight mimics the sustained leg extension of a sled push\n5. **Band-Resisted March** \u2014 attach a heavy band to a rig, lean forward, and march in place for 30-60 seconds. Closest biomechanical match to the sled push.\n\n**For Sled Pull (Rope):**\n\n1. **Hand-Over-Hand Rope Pull on Rower** \u2014 remove the handle, attach a thick rope to the rower chain, and pull hand-over-hand. Closest movement pattern match.\n2. **Seated Cable Row (Max Distance)** \u2014 set up on a cable machine, pull the entire stack hand-over-hand without resetting. Build grip endurance.\n3. **Rope Climb Pulls (from floor)** \u2014 lay a rope on the ground, sit in a wide stance, and pull it through your hands for distance. Practice the hand-over-hand motion.\n4. **Heavy Rows + Farmer Carry Superset** \u2014 4x12 barbell rows + 4x100m farmer carries. Builds the posterior chain and grip endurance combination the sled pull demands.\n\n**Training Structure Without Sled Access**\n\nIf you truly can't access sleds:\n\n| Day | Sled Push Substitute | Sled Pull Substitute |\n|-----|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Mon | Wall push isometrics 4x45s | Seated cable rope pulls 4x30s |\n| Thu | Band-resisted march 4x30s + walking lunges 4x50m | Heavy rows 4x12 + farmer carry 4x100m |\n\nThen at minimum **once every 2 weeks**, find a facility with actual sleds and do a dedicated sled session: 6x50m push + 6x50m pull at race weight. The movement pattern is specific enough that you can't fully replicate it with substitutes."}]}

Does that mental toughness transfer to Hyrox?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes \u2014 and this is one of the most underappreciated advantages CrossFit athletes bring to Hyrox. But the mental game is different in specific ways you need to prepare for.\n\n**What Transfers Directly**\n\nLong chippers and Hero WODs build three mental skills that Hyrox demands:\n\n1. **Tolerance for sustained discomfort.** A 45-minute Hero WOD teaches your brain that feeling terrible doesn't mean you should stop. Hyrox is 60-90 minutes of continuous work. Your brain has already learned to manage that duration.\n\n2. **Task management under fatigue.** In a chipper like Filthy Fifty, you're managing effort across 10 different movements. In Hyrox, it's 16 tasks (8 runs + 8 stations). The cognitive skill of \"what's next, what's my plan, what's my pace\" under severe fatigue is identical.\n\n3. **The ability to keep moving.** CrossFit athletes have practiced hundreds of hours of \"don't stop, keep going, one more rep.\" This eliminates the quit impulse that non-CrossFit athletes face at Station 6 when their legs are burning.\n\n**What's Different About Hyrox Mental Demands**\n\n1. **Pacing discipline over intensity.** In CrossFit, mental toughness usually means \"go harder.\" In Hyrox, mental toughness means **\"hold back now so you can maintain pace later.\"** The athlete who sled pushes at 95% effort and then walks the next 1km run loses to the athlete who pushes at 80% and maintains a consistent run pace. This requires a different kind of mental control \u2014 restraint, not aggression.\n\n2. **Monotony management.** Hyrox has 8 x 1km runs. The runs feel the same. The scenery is an indoor convention center. There's no variance, no surprise workout \u2014 just the same race format every time. CrossFit athletes are trained for variety. Hyrox demands mental engagement during monotonous repetition.\n\n3. **Negative split management.** Your 8th 1km run needs to be nearly as fast as your 1st. In CrossFit, it's acceptable (even expected) to slow down in later rounds. In Hyrox, the best athletes run negative or even splits. This requires confidence that you have more in the tank \u2014 a mental skill built through practice, not just toughness.\n\n**How to Train the Hyrox Mental Game**\n\n1. **Practice race simulations monthly.** Run 4-8 stations with 1km runs between. Pre-set your target splits for each run. The goal is NOT to go as fast as possible \u2014 it's to hit your target splits consistently. This trains pacing discipline.\n\n2. **Do 100-rep wall ball sets.** Monotony tolerance. You'll want to stop at 60. Don't. Break it into sets of 10, use your breathing routine, and practice the mental self-talk that keeps you going.\n\n3. **Practice the \"next run\" moment.** The hardest mental moment in Hyrox is finishing a grueling station (sled push, lunges) and forcing yourself to start running again. Train this specifically: finish a heavy station, stand up, and immediately start jogging \u2014 even if it's a shuffle. The first 200m is the mental battle. After that, your body finds a rhythm.\n\nYour CrossFit mental toughness is real and valuable. Now refine it: from \"go harder\" to \"go smarter, go longer, go more consistently.\""}]}

Here's how to navigate this:\n\n**The Problem with Pure Variance for Hyrox**\n\nCrossFit's constantly varied approach builds readiness for the \"unknown and unknowable.\" But Hyrox is entirely known:\n- 8 x 1km runs (known distance, known surface)\n- 8 specific stations (known movements, known loads, known reps/distances)\n- Known order (ski erg \u2192 sled push \u2192 sled pull \u2192 burpee broad jumps \u2192 row \u2192 farmer carry \u2192 lunges \u2192 wall balls)\n- Known race duration (~60-90 minutes)\n\nApplying pure variance to a known event is like studying random subjects for a test where you already have the answer key. You need **specificity within a varied framework**.\n\n**The Adapted Principle: \"Strategically Varied Within Hyrox Domains\"**\n\nKeep the spirit of variation but constrain it to Hyrox-relevant movements, time domains, and energy systems:\n\n**1. Vary the Conditioning FORMAT, Not the Movements**\n\nUse CrossFit's format library \u2014 AMRAP, EMOM, For Time, Chipper \u2014 but populate them with Hyrox movements:\n\n- Monday EMOM: Wall balls + row calories (alternating every minute x 20)\n- Wednesday For Time: 1km run \u2192 50m sled push \u2192 1km run \u2192 100m farmer carry \u2192 1km run\n- Friday AMRAP 20: 15 cal ski erg + 10 burpee broad jumps + 200m run\n\nSame variety in workout structure, different movement selection.\n\n**2. Vary the Intensity Distribution, Not the Energy Systems**\n\nHyrox primarily tests aerobic capacity with glycolytic bursts at stations. Vary how you train these systems:\n- Week 1: Long sustained effort (40-min EMOM at moderate intensity)\n- Week 2: Short explosive intervals (8 x 3-min AMRAPs with 1-min rest)\n- Week 3: Race simulation (full Hyrox format)\n- Week 4: Deload (reduced volume, technique focus)\n\n**3. Periodize Toward Specificity**\n\nCrossFit's 12-week Hyrox prep model on CrossFit.com actually addresses this directly: full CrossFit \u2192 reduced CrossFit + increased specificity \u2192 taper. Apply it:\n\n- **Weeks 1-6 (Far from race)**: 70% general CrossFit conditioning / 30% Hyrox-specific\n- **Weeks 7-12 (Building toward race)**: 40% general / 60% Hyrox-specific\n- **Weeks 13-15 (Peak)**: 20% general / 80% Hyrox-specific\n- **Week 16 (Taper)**: Light Hyrox-specific work only\n\nThe \"variation\" decreases as specificity increases \u2014 this is standard periodization applied to CrossFit's framework.\n\n**4. Keep Variance in Your Strength Work**\n\nYou don't need to squat the same way every week. Vary the squat stimulus while keeping it Hyrox-relevant:\n- Week 1: Back Squat 5x5 @ 80% (maximal strength)\n- Week 2: Front Squat 4x8 @ 70% with 30X1 tempo (strength-endurance)\n- Week 3: Wall Ball 5x20 (sport-specific strength-endurance)\n- Week 4: Goblet Squat 3x15 + Walking Lunges 3x50m (deload + movement variety)\n\nAll build squat capacity for Hyrox. All are varied. None are random.\n\n**The Bottom Line**\n\nCrossFit's variance principle isn't wrong \u2014 it just needs constraints. Think of it as \"variance within relevance.\" Every workout should serve a Hyrox-specific purpose, even if the format, intensity, and specific exercise selection change from session to session."}]}

Let me break down the differences:\n\n**PRVN Hyrox (8/10 Hyrox Readiness)**\n\n- **Created by**: Tia-Clair Toomey, Shane Orr, coached by James Kelly\n- **Cost**: $45/month (discounts for longer commitments, down to $36/month annually)\n- **Structure**: 8-week cycles, daily programming, year-round\n- **Strengths**: Multi-level scaling (Level 1/2/3), CrossFit-quality programming applied to Hyrox, race-day prep protocols, 60-minute session architecture\n- **Background**: Born from the most decorated CrossFit team in history, now applied to Hyrox\n- **Best for**: Athletes who want structured, ongoing daily programming they can follow year-round \u2014 not just a pre-race block. Athletes coming from CrossFit who appreciate the programming style.\n\n**LEVLS (8/10 Hyrox Readiness)**\n\n- **Created by**: Official Hyrox training partner\n- **Structure**: Two programs \u2014 HYROX Race (structured toward a specific race date) and HYROX Daily (year-round training)\n- **Strengths**: Official Hyrox partnership ensures alignment with actual race standards. Progressive methodology with **benchmark workouts at each of the 8 stations** \u2014 this is the standout feature. Station-specific performance tracking lets you identify and target your weaknesses.\n- **Best for**: Athletes who want the \"official\" Hyrox experience and value station-by-station benchmarking. Data-driven athletes who want to track improvement at each individual station.\n\n**Roxlyfe 12-Week Plan (7/10 Hyrox Readiness)**\n\n- **Created by**: The Roxlyfe team\n- **Cost**: Lower price point (designed for non-professional athletes)\n- **Structure**: Fixed 12-week plan with multi-level scaling\n- **Strengths**: Exceptional user testimonials \u2014 athletes report **3:30 to 5:30+ improvements** on race times. **Weekly Hyrox simulation** built into the program \u2014 a major confidence builder. Comprehensive coverage of runs, intervals, strength, and station work.\n- **Best for**: First-time Hyrox athletes who want a proven, affordable, structured plan with a clear start and end date. Athletes who prefer a static program they can print and follow.\n\n**For Your First Hyrox, My Recommendation: Roxlyfe**\n\nHere's why:\n1. It's designed specifically for your situation \u2014 first-time athletes who aren't professionals\n2. The weekly race simulation is invaluable for first-timers. You'll arrive at your race having practiced the format multiple times.\n3. The user testimonials are the strongest evidence \u2014 real athletes getting real improvements\n4. The 12-week fixed structure gives you a clear start date (count back 12 weeks from race day) and a clear progression\n5. Lower cost commitment for your first go\n\n**After your first Hyrox**, switch to PRVN Hyrox or LEVLS for year-round programming. LEVLS if you want station-specific benchmarking to improve your weaknesses. PRVN if you want the best overall daily programming with long-term periodization."}]}

At this level, the training philosophy matters enormously because the margins are thin. Let me evaluate each approach:\n\n**CrossFit-Based (e.g., PRVN CrossFit track, CrossFit Mainsite): NOT SUFFICIENT**\n\nCrossFit builds incredible general fitness. CrossFit athletes consistently finish in the top third of Hyrox events \"off the couch.\" But CrossFit alone caps you at approximately 1:05-1:15 for most athletes because:\n- Running volume is insufficient (4-5 runs within WODs per week \u2260 30-40 dedicated running miles)\n- No Hyrox station specificity at race loads and volumes\n- No pacing practice for a 60-minute sustained effort\n- Time wasted on Olympic lifting and gymnastics\n\nCrossFit readiness for Hyrox: **4-5/10**\n\n**Running-Based (e.g., 80/20 Running, Marathon Plans): NOT SUFFICIENT**\n\nAn elite runner with no functional fitness background will have blazing run splits but hemorrhage time at the stations \u2014 especially sled push/pull, wall balls, and lunges. Running alone is only 50% of the Hyrox equation.\n\nThe 80/20 running methodology provides the scientifically optimal running engine, but it offers zero strength, zero station work, zero race simulation.\n\nRunning-only readiness for Hyrox: **3/10**\n\n**Hybrid Approach: THE ANSWER \u2014 But Specifically Engineered**\n\nA sub-60 Hyrox demands:\n- **Running splits averaging ~4:15-4:30/km** across all 8 segments (even under fatigue)\n- **Station times that don't exceed 3-4 minutes** per station\n- **Minimal transition losses**\n\nThis requires simultaneous development of:\n1. High aerobic capacity (VO2 max above 55 ml/kg/min)\n2. Muscular endurance under load\n3. Station-specific technique efficiency\n4. Race-pace pacing discipline\n\n**The Sub-60 Training Architecture**\n\n| Component | Volume | Source |\n|-----------|--------|--------|\n| Running | 30-40 miles/week, polarized 80/20 | 80/20 methodology |\n| Strength | 2 sessions/week, percentage-based | HWPO's periodization model |\n| Station Practice | 3 sessions/week, race loads | PRVN Hyrox / LEVLS approach |\n| Race Simulation | 1x/week (full or partial) | Roxlyfe's weekly simulation model |\n| Zone 2 Work | 2-3 sessions/week (can overlap with easy runs) | Nick Bare's aerobic philosophy |\n\nWeekly hours: 10-14 hours of total training.\n\n**The Specific Week**\n\n| Day | AM | PM |\n|-----|-----|----|\n| Mon | Easy run 5 mi (Zone 2) | Station practice \u2014 sled + wall balls |\n| Tue | Tempo run 6 mi | Strength \u2014 squat + deadlift (HWPO-style) |\n| Wed | Easy run 5 mi (Zone 2) | Station practice \u2014 row + carry + lunges |\n| Thu | VO2 max intervals 6 mi | Strength \u2014 upper body + accessories |\n| Fri | Easy run 4 mi (Zone 2) | Station practice \u2014 ski erg + burpee broad jumps |\n| Sat | Race simulation: 8 stations + 8 x 1km runs | \u2014 |\n| Sun | Long run 8-10 mi (Zone 2) | Rest |\n\nTotal running: ~38-42 miles/week.

His HAOS (Hunter's Academy of Strength) platform is built on real competitive achievement. But \"created by the best\" doesn't automatically mean \"best for you.\" Let me give you the real assessment.\n\n**HAOS Overview**\n\n- **Cost**: $39.99/month\n- **Structure**: 6 days/week, ~100 minutes per session, ~10 hours/week total\n- **Programs**: Four progressive levels \u2014 Intro Athlete \u2192 Strength \u2192 Run \u2192 Pro\n- **Cycle Length**: 8-12 weeks per program phase\n- **Philosophy**: A \"proven yearly periodization model\" designed for multiple racing disciplines (Hyrox, Spartan, CrossFit, trail running)\n\n**What HAOS Gets Right (7/10 Hyrox Readiness)**\n\n1. **The four-level progressive system** is elegant. Athletes self-select their starting level and advance systematically. An AI coaching system should absolutely replicate this structure.\n2. **Yearly periodization** that peaks athletes for specific races while maintaining year-round readiness \u2014 this is real coaching, not just random workouts.\n3. **Dual focus on strength AND running** as co-equal pillars \u2014 neither is bolted onto the other.\n4. **1-on-1 coaching available** through Hunter McIntyre and Parker Gregory for athletes wanting individualized programming.\n\n**Where HAOS Falls Short**\n\n1. **Multi-sport generalism.** HAOS trains for Spartan, Hyrox, CrossFit, AND trail running. This means the programming isn't exclusively Hyrox-optimized. You're training for breadth when Hyrox rewards depth.\n\n2. **Non-adaptive programming.** Everyone at the same level follows the same workouts. Your individual weaknesses (maybe your sled pull is slow but your running is fast) aren't addressed.\n\n3. **~100 minutes per session, 10 hours/week.** That's a significant time commitment. For comparison, PRVN Hyrox runs 60-minute sessions.\n\n4. **The \"world record holder\" argument has limits.** Hunter's genetics, training history, and full-time athletic career aren't replicable through an app. His world record reflects his individual capacity, not necessarily the superiority of his programming for average athletes.\n\n**How HAOS Compares to Alternatives**\n\n| Program | Hyrox Score | Hyrox-Exclusive? | Session Length | Cost |\n|---------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|------|\n| PRVN Hyrox | 8/10 | Yes | 60 min | $45/mo |\n| LEVLS | 8/10 | Yes | Varies | Varies |\n| HAOS | 7/10 | No (multi-sport) | ~100 min | $40/mo |\n| Roxlyfe | 7/10 | Yes | Varies | Lower |\n| HWPO Hyrox | 7/10 | Yes (within HWPO) | ~60 min | $49/mo |\n\n**My Recommendation**\n\nChoose HAOS if you compete in **multiple racing disciplines** (Spartan + Hyrox + trail running) and want a single program that keeps you competitive across all of them. The yearly periodization model is ideal for this.\n\nChoose PRVN Hyrox or LEVLS if Hyrox is your **primary competitive focus**. The Hyrox-exclusive programming, shorter sessions, and station-specific benchmarking give you more sport-specific return on training time.\n\nHunter is the GOAT. His program is good. But \"best athlete\" and \"best program for you\" are different questions."}]}

You'll encounter wall balls, rowing, ski erg, burpees, sled work, carries, and running \u2014 just not frequently enough or at Hyrox-specific volumes.\n\n2. **Every WOD format** is represented: AMRAP, For Time, EMOM, Chipper, Tabata. These are the conditioning templates that Hyrox programs use \u2014 just populated with different movements.\n\n3. **Heavy days** for squat, deadlift, press, clean, and snatch build general strength. Squat and deadlift strength directly supports sled push/pull and lunge performance.\n\n4. **Time domains range from 3-40+ minutes**, giving you exposure to both anaerobic and aerobic demands.\n\n5. **The chipper format** on Mainsite is the single most Hyrox-transferable WOD type. CrossFit's own article calls the Hyrox race \"one heck of a chipper.\"\n\n**What Mainsite Critically Misses**\n\n1. **Zero structured running program.** Occasional 400m-1600m runs appear within WODs, but there's no dedicated running development. This alone makes Mainsite inadequate for serious Hyrox competition.\n\n2. **No periodization.** Mainsite's \"unknown and unknowable\" philosophy means it never peaks athletes for a specific event. Hyrox athletes need periodized 8-16 week blocks culminating in race-day readiness.\n\n3. **No Hyrox race simulation.** You'll never practice the run-station-run-station format that defines the race.\n\n4. **Heavy Olympic lifting emphasis** with no Hyrox transfer. Snatches and cleans consume significant training time that would be better spent on station practice.\n\n5. **No pacing education.** Mainsite rewards all-out intensity. Hyrox demands strategic pacing across 60-90 minutes.\n\n6. **Station movements at wrong volumes.** Mainsite might program 30 wall balls in a chipper. Hyrox demands 100. The fitness required for 30 and 100 are fundamentally different.\n\n**Dedicated Hyrox Programs (PRVN Hyrox, LEVLS) Score: 8/10**\n\nThey provide everything Mainsite doesn't:\n- Structured running at multiple intensities\n- Station practice at race loads and volumes\n- Weekly race simulations\n- 8-12 week periodized blocks\n- Pacing strategy development\n- Progressive benchmarking\n\n**The Practical Answer**\n\n- **Mainsite as your ONLY program?** You'll finish your Hyrox in the top 40-50% based on general fitness alone. But you won't be competitive and the running will be painful.\n- **Mainsite + supplemental running + weekend station practice?** You can get to top 25-30%.\n- **A dedicated Hyrox program?** Top 10-20% is achievable for a committed athlete.\n\nMainsite is a great foundation. It's an insufficient race preparation tool. If Hyrox is your goal, use Mainsite for 2-3 days of general conditioning and build everything else around it with Hyrox-specific programming."}]}

Start here for 8-12 weeks to build:\n- Basic movement patterns (squat, hinge, press, pull)\n- Running fitness (the 5K program is a great starting point)\n- Two-a-day training tolerance\n- Garmin integration for heart rate zone awareness\n\nThen transition to Roxlyfe's 12-week plan (affordable, first-timer friendly, weekly simulations).\n\n**2nd: Roxlyfe 12-Week Plan (Direct Entry)**\n\nIf you have at least 16 weeks before your race, Roxlyfe's plan includes scaling options for beginners and builds progressively. User testimonials specifically mention it being \"accessible to non-professional athletes.\" The weekly race simulation is invaluable for building confidence.\n\n**3rd: CompTrain (If You Join a CrossFit Gym)**\n\nIf you want the social and coaching support of a gym, CompTrain-programmed affiliates are the best entry point. Bergeron explicitly designs for the majority, not the top 10%. No complex gymnastics, running 2-3x/week, and in-person coaching helps beginners learn movement standards safely.\n\n**NOT Recommended for Beginners**\n\n- **HWPO**: Assumes CrossFit experience, 2-hour sessions, Olympic lifting\n- **PRVN Affiliate**: Includes ring muscle-ups, complex barbell work\n- **HAOS**: 100-minute sessions, 10 hours/week commitment\n- **Persist**: Filly and reviewers explicitly say it's \"not suited for true beginners\"\n- **Nick Bare's Hybrid Approach**: 65 miles/week of running, two-a-days as default\n- **80/20 Running**: Purely a running methodology with zero strength component\n\n**The Complete Beginner 24-Week Plan**\n\n**Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-8)**\nFollow BPN's 5K running program + Hybrid Athlete strength basics\n- Learn: squatting, hinging, pressing, pulling, running\n- Build to: running 3x/week (12-15 miles total), lifting 3x/week\n- Goal: complete a 5K and feel comfortable in a gym\n\n**Phase 2: Hyrox Introduction (Weeks 9-16)**\nTransition to Roxlyfe's 12-week plan\n- Learn: all 8 Hyrox stations at light weights\n- Build: running to 18-22 miles/week, station practice 2x/week\n- Goal: complete a mock race simulation at reduced loads\n\n**Phase 3: Race Prep (Weeks 17-22)**\nContinue Roxlyfe plan with progressive loading\n- Build: station work at race weights, running peaks at 22-25 miles/week\n- Practice: weekly race simulations\n- Goal: complete a full simulation at race loads\n\n**Phase 4: Taper (Weeks 23-24)**\nReduce volume, maintain intensity, practice race-day logistics\n\nTotal investment: $0 for the first 8 weeks (BPN is free), then the cost of Roxlyfe for the remainder.

Let me show you exactly where standard CrossFit programming falls short for Hyrox \u2014 and I'll be specific so you can have a productive conversation with your coach about it.\n\n**Where Your Coach Is Right**\n\nCrossFit 5x/week builds:\n- Excellent general work capacity\n- Movement competency across all Hyrox station exercises (wall balls, rowing, ski erg, carries)\n- Mental toughness for long efforts\n- Metabolic conditioning across all energy systems\n\nCrossFit athletes DO finish Hyrox events. They typically land in the **top third to top half** without any Hyrox-specific training. So if your goal is to \"finish,\" your coach might be right.\n\n**Where the Data Disagrees**\n\n**Running Deficiency \u2014 The Biggest Gap**\n\nStandard CrossFit programming includes running within WODs (200m-1600m pieces, maybe 2-3 miles total per week). Hyrox has 8km of race running. Competitive Hyrox athletes run 20-40 miles per week in training.\n\nMat Fraser \u2014 arguably the greatest CrossFitter ever \u2014 said after his first Hyrox: \"The stations I was keeping up just fine. But on the running, there were a couple times I was like, 'O'Keefe, chill.'\" If running was Fraser's limiter, it's definitely yours.\n\n**Station Volume Gap**\n\nCrossFit might program 30 wall balls in a WOD. Hyrox demands 100. CrossFit might include a 500m row. Hyrox demands 1,000m after running 5km. The gap between CrossFit volumes and Hyrox race volumes is significant enough that the fitness required is qualitatively different.\n\n**Pacing Skill Gap**\n\nCrossFit trains intensity. Hyrox trains pacing. Without practicing even-paced 1km runs between stations, you won't know how to manage your effort across a 60-90 minute race.\n\n**The Compromise: Keep CrossFit + Add Hyrox Layers**\n\nDon't quit your gym \u2014 your coach and community are valuable. Instead, add these outside of class:\n\n**Add 3 sessions per week:**\n\n1. **Running \u2014 Tempo (Tuesday or Thursday morning, 40 min)**\n   1.5 mi warm-up \u2192 2 mi at 75-85% HR \u2192 1 mi cool-down\n\n2. **Running \u2014 Easy + Zone 2 (Saturday or Sunday, 50-60 min)**\n   6-8 miles at conversational pace\n\n3. **Hyrox Simulation (Weekend, 60-75 min)**\n   4-6 stations with 1km runs between. Practice pacing.\n\nTotal additional time: ~2.5-3 hours/week. This closes the three critical gaps (running volume, station specificity, pacing practice) while preserving everything your CrossFit classes provide.\n\n**How to Talk to Your Coach**\n\nShow your coach the comparison data: CrossFit programs score 4-5/10 for Hyrox readiness. Purpose-built Hyrox programs score 7-8/10. The gap is running, station volume, and pacing \u2014 not the things CrossFit does well (strength, conditioning formats, mental toughness). You're not replacing CrossFit; you're supplementing it. Most coaches will respect that."}]}

Strength drops to 1 session/week (maintenance). Hyrox practice 2-3x/week.\n\n**Phase 3: Peak (Weeks 15-18)**\n\nRace simulation every Saturday at full race loads. Running peaks then begins tapering. Strength stays at 1 maintenance session.\n\n**Phase 4: Taper (Weeks 19-20)**\n\nVolume drops 40%. 2-3 easy runs, 1 light station practice, rest and race-day prep.\n\n**The Mental Shift**\n\nThis is the hardest part for ex-CrossFitters: you'll feel like you're \"not training hard enough\" because you're not on the floor after every session. That's by design. CrossFit rewards intensity; Hyrox rewards consistency and pacing. Trust the aerobic base building \u2014 it's the unglamorous work that separates Hyrox competitors from Hyrox finishers."}]}

Let me diagnose the likely issue.\n\nThe problem with CrossFit Mainsite + random running is that **neither has a plan for the other**. Mainsite doesn't account for your running fatigue, and your running doesn't account for your CrossFit volume. You end up:\n\n1. Running on legs that are destroyed from yesterday's heavy squat WOD\n2. Doing CrossFit conditioning when your body needs recovery from a hard tempo run\n3. Accumulating fatigue without adequate recovery because total training stress is unmanaged\n\nTell me: how many days per week are you doing CrossFit, how many days running, and what does a typical week look like?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I do Mainsite 5x per week and I try to run 3x per week on top of that. Some days I double up. Total maybe 8 sessions per week. I'm always tired and my run pace isn't improving."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Eight sessions per week with no structured recovery programming \u2014 that's your answer. You're chronically under-recovered, and both your running AND your CrossFit are suffering because of it.\n\n**The Core Problem: Unmanaged Total Training Stress**\n\nEvery training session creates a stress response. Your body can only absorb so much before adaptation stops and fatigue accumulates:\n- 5 CrossFit sessions = significant strength and metabolic stress\n- 3 running sessions = cardiovascular and musculoskeletal stress\n- Doubling up some days = even more stress without extra recovery\n- Result: your body never supercompensates because it's always playing catch-up\n\n**The Fix: Structured Integration with Managed Volume**\n\nDrop from 8 sessions to 6 sessions per week, but make every session purposeful:\n\n| Day | Session | Purpose | RPE |\n|-----|---------|---------|-----|\n| **Mon** | CrossFit Mainsite (strength focus) | Squat or deadlift strength | 7-8 |\n| **Tue** | Easy run 4-5 mi (Zone 2) | Aerobic base \u2014 this is RECOVERY from Monday | 5-6 |\n| **Wed** | CrossFit Mainsite (conditioning focus) | Work capacity development | 7-8 |\n| **Thu** | Tempo run 5 mi | Lactate threshold development | 7-8 |\n| **Fri** | CrossFit Mainsite (lighter day or skill work) | Movement quality, not intensity | 5-6 |\n| **Sat** | Long run 6-8 mi (Zone 2) OR Hyrox simulation | Aerobic endurance or race-specific practice | 6-7 |\n| **Sun** | COMPLETE REST | Recovery. Non-negotiable. | 0 |\n\n**Key Changes:**\n\n1. **CrossFit drops from 5 to 3 sessions.** This is the hardest change for CrossFitters to accept, but 5 Mainsite sessions + 3 runs is too much total stress. Three quality CrossFit sessions preserve your strength and conditioning while creating recovery space for running improvement.\n\n2. **Easy running is EASY.** Your Tuesday and Saturday runs must be Zone 2 \u2014 conversational pace. These are active recovery sessions, not additional stress. If your heart rate goes above 70% of max, slow down.\n\n3. **Only ONE hard running session per week.** Thursday's tempo run is your quality session. This follows the polarized training model \u2014 80% easy, 20% hard.\n\n4. **Sunday is complete rest.** No running, no CrossFit, no \"active recovery.\" Sleep, eat, hydrate.\n\n5. **Never double up high-intensity sessions.** Monday CrossFit + Monday afternoon tempo run = recipe for stagnation. Separate hard sessions by at least 24 hours.\n\n**Why This Will Work**\n\nWith proper recovery, your body can actually adapt to the training stimulus. You'll likely see your run pace improve within 3-4 weeks simply because you're no longer running on exhausted legs. Your CrossFit performance will also improve because your 3 sessions are higher quality when you're not chronically fatigued.\n\nThe paradox of concurrent training: doing LESS total volume with BETTER recovery often produces more improvement than doing more volume with insufficient recovery. \"Stimulate, don't obliterate\" \u2014 it's not just a catchphrase, it's the fundamental principle of concurrent training."}]}

How should we structure our training together?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hyrox Doubles is a brilliant entry point. Let me make sure you understand the format correctly first, because this is the #1 thing people get wrong about Doubles:\n\n**Doubles Format — The Critical Rules**\n- **BOTH partners run ALL 8 x 1km runs TOGETHER.** You cannot split, alternate, or divide the runs. You run side by side for every single 1km segment.\n- The 8 stations are split between partners — each person does 4 stations.\n- While one partner works a station, the other partner waits in the transition zone.\n- The clock runs continuously throughout.\n\nThis means Doubles is NOT half the work — you still run the full 8km. The advantage is you only do 4 of 8 stations, and you get rest periods while your partner works their stations.\n\n**Station Assignment Strategy**\n\nFirst question: what are each of your relative strengths from CrossFit? Specifically, who's the better runner, who's stronger on sled work, and who has better muscular endurance for wall balls and lunges?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I'm the stronger one — bigger guy, better at heavy lifts. My partner is faster and has better cardio endurance. We've been CrossFitting together for 2 years."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Classic complementary pairing — let's assign stations to your strengths. Each partner does 4 stations:\n\n**Your Stations (Strength-Biased)**\n1. **Sled Push** (152kg men) — your raw strength advantage\n2. **Sled Pull** (103kg men) — posterior chain and grip strength\n3. **Farmer Carry** (2x24kg) — loaded carry favors the bigger athlete\n4. **Sandbag Lunges** (20kg sandbag) — leg strength and body mass advantage\n\n**Partner's Stations (Endurance-Biased)**\n1. **Ski Erg** (1,000m) — aerobic capacity\n2. **Row** (1,000m) — aerobic capacity + pacing\n3. **Burpee Broad Jumps** (80m) — bodyweight movement favors lighter, faster athlete\n4. **Wall Balls** (100 reps) — sustained muscular endurance + aerobic capacity\n\n**Training Structure (12-Week Plan)**\n\n**Joint Sessions (3x/week — do these together)**\n\n| Day | Session | Focus |\n|-----|---------|-------|\n| **Mon** | CrossFit-style conditioning with Hyrox movements | Both athletes, full session |\n| **Wed** | Doubles simulation — practice running together + station transitions | Race-specific |\n| **Sat** | Full or partial Doubles race simulation | Build from 4 to 8 stations |\n\n**Individual Sessions (2-3x/week — train your weaknesses)**\n\n**You (Strength athlete):**\n- Tue: Easy run 4 mi (Zone 2) — critical because you run ALL 8km in Doubles\n- Thu: Sled push 6x50m + sled pull 6x50m + farmer carry 4x200m at race loads\n- Fri: Tempo run 4 mi — running is still the biggest time component even in Doubles\n\n**Partner (Endurance athlete):**\n- Tue: Ski erg intervals (5x1km with 2 min rest) + rowing intervals (5x500m)\n- Thu: Easy run 4 mi (Zone 2)\n- Fri: Wall balls 5x20 at race weight/height + burpee broad jump technique practice\n\n**Wednesday Doubles Simulation Template**\n\nPractice the actual race flow:\n1. BOTH partners run 1km together (match the slower partner's pace)\n2. Partner B completes Station 1 (ski erg) while Partner A waits in transition zone\n3. BOTH partners run 1km together\n4. Partner A completes Station 2 (sled push) while Partner B waits\n5. BOTH partners run 1km together\n6. Continue alternating stations...\n\nKey things to practice:\n- **Running together** — the faster partner must match the slower partner's pace. Practice this! If your partner runs 4:30/km and you run 5:00/km, you both run ~5:00/km. The faster partner gets active recovery on runs.\n- **Transition speed** — when the station is done, how fast can you both start running again?\n- **Rest management** — what do you do in the transition zone while your partner works? (Light movement, hydration, mental prep for your next station)\n- **Pacing consistency** — track your 1km run splits together. The goal: each split within 10 seconds of each other.\n\n**Doubles-Specific Pacing Strategy**\n\nBecause you rest during your partner's stations (~2-4 minutes per station), you can push YOUR assigned stations harder than in singles. But remember — you still have to run immediately after your partner finishes their station. Don't blow up your legs on sled push and then struggle to run the next 1km with your partner.\n\nThe key advantage for your pairing: your partner is faster, so the runs will feel easier for them (essentially active recovery). Meanwhile, you're the one who needs to keep up on runs but then gets to rest while your partner does their endurance stations. It balances out beautifully."}]}

Running volume alone doesn't make a Hyrox program.\n\n4. **General CrossFit is a 4-5/10 starting point.** It builds excellent base fitness but lacks the three things that separate Hyrox competitors from Hyrox finishers: dedicated running volume, station-specific practice, and race simulation.\n\n5. **The optimal approach synthesizes elements from multiple programs**: Running methodology from 80/20 + station specificity from PRVN/LEVLS + periodization from HWPO + concurrent development from CompTrain + movement quality from Persist. An AI coaching system that combines these would approach a 9-10/10.\n\n**Practical Recommendation**\n\nFor most athletes: choose a Tier 1 program as your primary training platform. Supplement with additional running (if below 25 miles/week) and consider Persist's mobility protocols as a recovery tool. The research clearly shows that Hyrox-specific programs outperform general fitness programs by 2-4 points on the readiness scale \u2014 that gap represents minutes on your race time."}]}

Let me give you both sides with evidence.\n\n**The Case FOR CrossFit Athletes at Hyrox**\n\nCrossFit's own article on the topic (CrossFit.com, January 2026) makes a compelling argument. CrossFit athletes arrive at Hyrox with:\n\n1. **Pre-adapted metabolic pathways**: You're already trained across phosphocreatine (burpee broad jumps), glycolytic (sled push/pull, rowing), and oxidative (8km running) energy systems. Most athletes only train 1-2 of these.\n\n2. **Movement familiarity**: As CrossFit.com states, CrossFit athletes are \"no strangers to the ski erg, rower, sleds, lunges, carries, or burpee broad jumps. And we invented the wall-ball shot.\" You know the movements. You know the standards. There's no learning curve on race day.\n\n3. **Work capacity across broad time and modal domains**: CrossFit literally defines fitness this way. A Hyrox race is a 60-90 minute mixed-modal chipper \u2014 that's CrossFit's specialty.\n\n4. **Mental toughness**: Hero WODs and long chippers build the psychological resilience to push through the final stations when everything hurts.\n\n**The result**: CrossFit athletes typically finish in the **top third** of Hyrox events without sport-specific training. That IS impressive.\n\n**The Case AGAINST \"Off the Couch\" Success**\n\nBut here's where the narrative breaks down:\n\n1. **Fraser's own admission**: Even the greatest CrossFit athlete ever said after his first Hyrox: \"The stations I was keeping up just fine. But on the running, there were a couple times I was like, 'O'Keefe, chill.'\" If Fraser \u2014 5x Fittest Man on Earth \u2014 struggled with the running, you will too.\n\n2. **Running volume is the critical gap**: CrossFit programs 200m-1600m runs within WODs. Hyrox demands 8km of sustained running between stations. The physiological demands are categorically different. CrossFit builds VO2 max but not the aerobic base needed for consistent 1km splits across an 8-segment race.\n\n3. **Top third is not competitive**: Finishing in the top third means you're losing 10-20+ minutes to dedicated Hyrox athletes. The gap is almost entirely in running splits and late-race pacing.\n\n4. **Station volumes differ**: CrossFit might program 30 wall balls in a WOD. Hyrox demands 100. That's a qualitatively different challenge that CrossFit doesn't specifically train.\n\n5. **Pacing is a trained skill**: CrossFit rewards all-out intensity. Hyrox punishes it. Without pacing practice, CrossFit athletes typically redline on the sled push and hemorrhage time on subsequent runs.\n\n**The Real Picture**\n\n| Athlete Profile | Expected Hyrox Finish |\n|----------------|----------------------|\n| CrossFit athlete, no Hyrox prep | Top 30-40% |\n| CrossFit athlete + 8 weeks of running + station practice | Top 15-25% |\n| CrossFit athlete + 12-16 weeks of dedicated Hyrox program | Top 5-15% |\n| Dedicated Hyrox athlete (year-round training) | Top 1-10% |\n\nCrossFit gives you an excellent starting point \u2014 better than almost any other fitness background. But \"doing well\" and \"being competitive\" are different goals. If you want to finish, CrossFit is more than enough. If you want to compete, you need 8-16 weeks of Hyrox-specific work on top of your CrossFit base \u2014 primarily focused on running volume and race simulation."}]}

The research is unequivocal on this.\n\n**The Science**\n\nThe polarized training model (80% easy / 20% hard) consistently outperforms all other intensity distributions:\n\n- **Seiler & Kjerland (2006)**: World and Olympic Champion endurance athletes spend 75-80% of training time at low intensity, despite racing at much higher intensities\n- **Helgerud et al. (2007)**: 4x4-minute intervals at 90-95% max HR produced **10.8% VO2 max improvement** vs only 3.5% for long slow distance \u2014 nearly 3x the improvement\n- **St\u00f6ggl & Sperlich (2014)**: After 9 weeks, the polarized group showed superior improvements in 10K time, VO2 max, running economy, AND lactate threshold vs threshold-only training. The threshold group actually DECLINED in some metrics.\n\n**Your 35 MPW Distribution Should Be:**\n\n| Zone | Miles | Percentage | Effort Level |\n|------|-------|-----------|-------------|\n| Zone 1-2 (Easy) | 28-30 miles | 80-85% | Full conversation, nose breathing possible |\n| Zone 4-5 (Hard) | 5-7 miles | 15-20% | Short sentences, labored breathing |\n| Zone 3 (Gray Zone) | 0 miles | 0% | **Eliminate this entirely** |\n\n**Critical for Hyrox Athletes**: Your Hyrox station work (sled push, wall balls, rowing intervals) **counts in the 20% hard bucket**. If you're doing 2-3 hard station sessions per week, you may only need 1-2 hard running sessions. The rest of your running must be genuinely easy.\n\n**Your Restructured Running Week**\n\n| Run | Day | Miles | Zone | Purpose |\n|-----|-----|-------|------|---------|\n| Easy 1 | Mon | 5 mi | Zone 2 | Recovery + volume accumulation |\n| Tempo | Wed | 6 mi | 2 mi easy \u2192 2.5 mi @ 75-85% HR \u2192 1.5 mi easy | Lactate threshold development |\n| Easy 2 | Thu | 4 mi | Zone 2 | Recovery from tempo |\n| Intervals | Fri | 6 mi | 1.5 mi warm-up \u2192 4x4 min @ 90-95% HR w/ 3 min jog \u2192 1.5 mi cool-down | VO2 max (the \"magic protocol\") |\n| Easy 3 | Sat | 5 mi | Zone 2 | Can combine with Hyrox simulation |\n| Long | Sun | 9 mi | Zone 2 | Aerobic infrastructure |\n| **Total** | | **35 mi** | **Easy: 23 mi (66%) / Hard: 12 mi (34%)** | |\n\n**Wait \u2014 66/34 isn't 80/20!**\n\nCorrect. That's because you also do Hyrox station work 2-3x/week, which IS high intensity. When you add those sessions to the \"hard\" bucket:\n\n- Running hard: 12 miles (~2 hours)\n- Station hard: ~2-3 hours of high-intensity work\n- Running easy: 23 miles (~3.5 hours)\n- Total hard: ~4-5 hours / Total easy: ~3.5 hours + warm-ups/cool-downs\n\nThe overall ratio becomes approximately **70/30 to 75/25** when including all training modalities \u2014 which is within the range that Seiler's research shows elite athletes actually operate in.\n\n**The Practical Fix**\n\nFor your easy runs, your perceived effort should feel **embarrassingly slow**. If someone passed you on the trail, you'd be self-conscious about your pace. That's the right effort level. Use a heart rate monitor \u2014 stay below 70% of max HR (or 65% of HRR). If you drift above that, walk for 30 seconds and resume.\n\nThe payoff: within 4-6 weeks, your hard sessions will get FASTER because you're actually recovering between them. And your late-race Hyrox running splits will improve because your aerobic base \u2014 built on all those easy miles \u2014 supports sustained output when everything else is fatigued."}]}

What are the essential elements every Hyrox program needs based on what works?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on analysis of the 12 most prominent training programs and what separates the 7-8/10 Hyrox programs from the 2-5/10 programs, there are **five non-negotiable elements** and **three differentiators** that separate good programs from great ones.\n\n**The 5 Non-Negotiable Elements**\n\nEvery successful Hyrox program \u2014 PRVN Hyrox (8/10), LEVLS (8/10), Roxlyfe (7/10), HAOS (7/10), HWPO Hyrox (7/10) \u2014 shares these traits:\n\n**1. Structured Periodization in 8-12 Week Blocks**\n\nRandom programming doesn't produce race-day readiness. Build mesocycles with clear phases: general preparation \u2192 specific preparation \u2192 peak \u2192 taper. Use HWPO's 4-week sub-blocks (3 weeks loading + 1 deload) within the larger cycle.\n\nFor your gym: Offer 8-week training blocks that align with local Hyrox race dates. Each block has a clear progression arc.\n\n**2. Weekly Race Simulation Sessions**\n\nThis is the single most differentiating feature of high-scoring Hyrox programs. Roxlyfe's weekly simulation sessions are the reason users report 3:30-5:30 improvements on race times. Athletes need to practice the run-station-run format regularly.\n\nFor your gym: Dedicate Saturday to a scaled simulation \u2014 start with 3-4 stations + 1km runs and build to 8 stations by the end of the block. This becomes your showcase class.\n\n**3. Scalable Difficulty Levels**\n\nPRVN's Level 1/2/3 system, HAOS's Intro \u2192 Strength \u2192 Run \u2192 Pro progression, and Roxlyfe's multi-level scaling all serve the same purpose: making the same program accessible to beginners and challenging for competitors.\n\nFor your gym: Create three scaling tiers for every workout:\n- **Level 1** (First Hyrox): Reduced loads, reduced volumes (e.g., sled push at 50% race weight, 50 wall balls)\n- **Level 2** (Competitive): Race loads, race volumes\n- **Level 3** (Elite): Race loads, accelerated pacing targets, added complexity\n\n**4. Integration of Running and Station Work**\n\nPrograms that separate running and station work entirely (like Persist or Nick Bare's general Hybrid Athlete) score poorly for Hyrox. The programs that integrate them \u2014 running between stations, compromised running after heavy efforts \u2014 score highest.\n\nFor your gym: Every Hyrox class should include running. Even if it's just a 400m run before and after the station work. Never do a Hyrox session without some running component.\n\n**5. Progressive Benchmarking**\n\nCompTrain's biweekly benchmark testing and LEVLS's station-specific benchmarks give athletes objective proof of improvement. Without data, athletes don't know if they're getting better.\n\nFor your gym: Test these 6 Hyrox benchmarks every 4 weeks:\n- 1km run time\n- 50m sled push time (race weight)\n- 1km row time\n- 100 wall balls time\n- 50m sled pull time (race weight)\n- 200m farmer carry time (race weight)\n\nTrack them on a whiteboard or app. Post improvements publicly.\n\n**The 3 Differentiators (Good \u2192 Great)**\n\n**6. Running as a Programmed Pillar** \u2014 Not just running within WODs, but structured running development: Zone 2 base building, tempo runs, VO2 max intervals. Follow the 80/20 polarized model. This requires either adding running sessions to your program or dedicating 1-2 class days to running-focused work.\n\n**7. Zone-Based Pacing Education** \u2014 Teach your athletes to train by heart rate zones. Enforce easy days (Zone 2 ONLY) and target specific zones for quality sessions. An athlete who understands their Zone 2 pace and their race pace will outperform an athlete who just \"goes hard\" every day.\n\n**8. Year-Round Programming** \u2014 Don't just offer a 12-week pre-race block. Build a year-round system with off-season hypertrophy blocks, base-building phases, and race-prep blocks that athletes can cycle through. HAOS's yearly periodization model is the gold standard here.\n\n**Revenue Structure**\n\nOffer the Hyrox program as a premium add-on: $60-85/month on top of regular membership. Include 3 dedicated Hyrox classes per week plus benchmark tracking. This positions your gym as a Hyrox destination \u2014 a differentiator that most CrossFit affiliates aren't offering yet."}]}

I'm coming from a CrossFit background and I've never trained this way."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Compromised running is hands-down the most Hyrox-specific training modality that neither pure running programs nor CrossFit programming addresses. It is running immediately after completing a demanding functional station — which is literally what you do eight times during a Hyrox race.\n\nHere is why it matters: When you finish a 50m sled push or 1,000m row, your heart rate is at 85-95% max, your legs are loaded with metabolic byproducts, and your breathing is ragged. Then you have to run 1km at a controlled pace. If you have never practiced running in this state, you will panic, go out too fast, blow up, and lose 30-60 seconds per running segment — that is 4-8 minutes lost across the race.\n\nHere is how to program compromised running into your training:\n\n**Beginner Protocol (Weeks 1-4):**\n- 2x per week after station work\n- Format: Complete a station movement at moderate effort, then immediately run 800m at target race pace\n- Example: 50 wall balls at 20 lb, then 800m run. Rest 3 minutes. Repeat 3 rounds.\n- RPE target: Station work at 6-7/10, running at 7/10\n\n**Intermediate Protocol (Weeks 5-10):**\n- 2x per week, increase station intensity and run distance\n- Format: Station at race effort, immediately run 1km at race pace\n- Example: 1,000m row for time, then 1km run. 200m farmer carry at race weight, then 1km run. Rest 4 minutes between pairs. Complete 3-4 pairs.\n- RPE target: Station at 8/10, running at 7-8/10\n\n**Race Simulation Protocol (Weeks 11-16):**\n- 1x per week as a partial or full simulation\n- Format: 3-4 stations chained with 1km runs between each, no rest\n- Example: Row 1km, run 1km, sled push 50m, run 1km, wall balls x100, run 1km — for total time\n\nThe key coaching cues for compromised running:\n1. **First 200m is survival pace** — do not chase speed here, let your heart rate come down 5-10 bpm\n2. **Settle into rhythm by 400m** — find your breathing pattern (inhale 2 steps, exhale 2 steps)\n3. **Final 200m can increase effort** — this is where you make up time if you paced correctly\n\nMat Fraser structures his compromised running as '800m run, row, 800m run, rest, 800m run, ski erg, 800m run' — alternating between machines and running to simulate the race feel. Coming from CrossFit, you are actually well-prepared for the metabolic discomfort. What you need to learn is pacing control under that discomfort rather than the redline-everything approach CrossFit rewards."}]}

How do I apply the 80/20 principle to my running when I'm also doing CrossFit-style station work?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"You have identified one of the most common mistakes hybrid athletes make — running in the 'gray zone' where every run feels moderately hard but nothing is truly easy or truly hard. The 80/20 principle will fix this, but applying it when you also do high-intensity station work requires a specific calculation.\n\nHere is the critical insight: **your station work counts as high-intensity training.** A heavy sled push session, a 100-rep wall ball set, a race simulation — these are NOT separate from your running intensity budget. They occupy your 20% hard allocation.\n\nAt 35 miles per week with 80/20 distribution:\n- **28 miles should be Zone 2** (easy, conversational pace, 60-70% max HR)\n- **7 miles should be Zone 4-5** (tempo and interval work, 75-95% max HR)\n\nBut here is the adjustment: if you are doing 2-3 hard station sessions per week, you may only have room for 1 hard running session. That means your running distribution might look more like 90/10, with the remaining 10% of hard effort coming from station work.\n\n**Sample Week at 35 MPW with Station Work:**\n\n| Day | Run | Station/Strength | Intensity |\n|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Monday | 6 mi Zone 2 | — | Easy |\n| Tuesday | 5 mi Zone 2 | PM: Hyrox stations (sled, wall balls) | Hard (stations) |\n| Wednesday | 7 mi with 3 mi tempo @ 75-85% HR | — | Hard (running) |\n| Thursday | 4 mi recovery Zone 1 | PM: Strength (squat/deadlift) | Moderate |\n| Friday | REST | — | Recovery |\n| Saturday | 5 mi easy | Race simulation or HIIT stations | Hard (stations) |\n| Sunday | 8 mi long run Zone 2 | — | Easy |\n\nThat gives you approximately 23 easy miles, 3 hard running miles, and 9 easy running miles on station days — plus 2-3 hard station sessions. Total hard sessions: 3 out of roughly 10 training inputs (30%), which is actually at the upper boundary. If you feel run down, drop to 2 hard station sessions per week.\n\nThe three essential running workouts every Hyrox athlete needs:\n1. **Zone 2 long run (60-90 min)** — builds mitochondrial density and fat oxidation\n2. **Tempo run (20-40 min at 75-85% max HR)** — raises lactate threshold, approximates race running pace\n3. **VO2 max intervals (4x4 min at 90-95% max HR with 3 min jog recovery)** — this protocol from Helgerud et al. produces nearly 3x the VO2 max improvement of moderate steady-state running\n\nThe biggest mistake to avoid: running your easy runs too fast. If you cannot hold a full conversation, you are in the gray zone. Slow down. Your easy pace might be 60-90 seconds per mile slower than your tempo pace. That feels embarrassingly slow to most CrossFit athletes, but it is exactly where the aerobic adaptations happen."}]}
