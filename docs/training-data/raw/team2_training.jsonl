On his heaviest weeks, he logs 16-20 hours total. Here's how his HAOS PRO program lays it out:\n\n**Weekly Split:**\n- **Monday:** Heavy Strength + Short Conditioning — deadlift variations, pull-up progressions, 20-minute EMOM finisher\n- **Tuesday:** Running Focus + Accessories — interval running, sled work, core strengthening\n- **Wednesday:** Full Body Power — Olympic lift variations, plyometric training, conditioning circuit\n- **Thursday:** Hyrox Simulation — race-specific workout, transition practice, time trials\n- **Friday:** Strength Endurance — high-rep strength work, muscular endurance, fatigue management\n- **Saturday:** Long Conditioning — extended aerobic work, movement quality, recovery focus\n\nThe key insight is his **non-negotiable weekly minimums**: at least one upper body intensity day, one lower body intensity day, and one dedicated track day every single week.\n\nHe also follows a **3 weeks on / 1 week deload** micro-cycle pattern within each phase. That recovery week is critical — even Hunter can't sustain 16+ hours indefinitely without accumulating injury risk.\n\nNow, for someone at your level — 35-40 miles per week running, 4-5 gym days — you absolutely should NOT copy this volume. But the **structure** is gold. The principle of dedicated simulation days (Thursday in his case) and separating heavy strength from conditioning days is something you can directly apply."}]}

How does he structure his training blocks?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Jake Dearden follows a **clear block periodization model** that's one of the most structured approaches in elite Hyrox. Here's how he breaks it down:\n\n| Timeframe | Focus |\n|-----------|-------|\n| **12+ weeks out** | Building a solid base — running and erg fitness, overall strength, progressing all fitness elements |\n| **12-6 weeks out** | Add Hyrox-specific exercises, progress to race-day weights, at least 1 Hyrox session per week, focus on muscular endurance and running speed |\n| **6-1 weeks out** | Very specific Hyrox exercises mimicking race day quantities, replicate race-day scenarios, practice technique/tactics, increase Hyrox sessions, trial race-day nutrition |\n| **Race week** | Deload — reduced intensity and frequency, rest days approaching race day, optimize nutrition and sleep |\n\nWhat makes Dearden's approach **unique** is his principle of keeping running and strength completely separate until the final 5-6 weeks before a race. His exact words: *\"I usually split up my running and my strength until about five to six weeks out. Then I might swap out a couple of sessions so I'm doing some weights and then going straight into running, to practise running under fatigue.\"*\n\nHe learned from ultrarunner Tom Evans that **what you do in the final month is what most affects your race**. So he front-loads the base building and saves the race-specific integration for when it matters most.\n\nThe other critical insight: he views each station **plus the following run** as a single exercise unit. That mental framework changes how you train and how you pace on race day."}]}

I keep hearing his diet is wild."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Wild is an understatement. Hunter's nutrition approach is arguably the most **extreme departure from conventional sports nutrition** in elite fitness. Here are the actual numbers:\n\n- **Daily calories:** 4,500-5,500\n- **Macros:** ~90g fat, 400-600g carbs, 180-250g protein\n- **Sugar intake:** 300-500g per day — his words: *\"Sugar's the sh*t, I love that stuff\"*\n- **Vegetables:** Zero. Literally none. He's said: *\"You can't pay me to eat vegetables. Superheroes aren't made of vegetables, they're made of calories.\"*\n\n**Daily staples:** 2-3 steaks per day, chicken, yogurt, maple syrup, honey, fruit, bread, pasta, oatmeal, sweet potatoes, Honey Nut Cheerios, ramen noodles, sticky buns.\n\n**Morning ritual:** Strong coffee with collagen, BLDR aminos (his own supplement brand), and 3 tablespoons of honey.\n\nHis diet is also **periodized**. Post-season: *\"I just got off a week of drinking as much as I could and eating ice cream.\"* As competition approaches, he cuts the rib-eye and shifts to leaner cuts — fish and chicken.\n\nNow, here's the critical context: **do not copy this.** Hunter trains 16-20 hours per week and has been building this engine for over a decade. His caloric expenditure justifies those numbers. At your training volume of 35-40 miles per week plus 4-5 gym sessions, you'd be looking at roughly 3,000-3,500 calories. The principle to take from Hunter is **eating enough to fuel your training** — most Hyrox athletes under-eat carbs. The specific foods are his personal preference, not a prescription."}]}

I've heard he has some kind of alter ego thing."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Hunter uses a deliberate **alter ego strategy** he calls **\"The Sheriff.\"** His philosophy: *\"You need an alter ego that comes out when necessary.\"*\n\nHere's how it works in practice:\n\n1. **Self-talk pattern:** He relentlessly bad-mouths himself during competition, but keeps it to only 2-3 repeated words so he doesn't get distracted. It's a narrowing technique — reduces cognitive load while maintaining intensity.\n\n2. **Competitive warfare mindset:** His exact words: *\"I treat this like war. I have tactics, I have strategy, I have mental warfare, I have physical warfare, I'll use guerrilla tactics.\"* He actively tries to intimidate opponents through body language and positioning.\n\n3. **Cold bar technique as mental prep:** He performs heavy strength feats **without warming up** — things like 15 pull-ups cold with a 50lb weight vest, or lifting 250lb stones cold. This isn't just grip training. It's training his nervous system to produce force under non-ideal conditions, which is exactly what Hyrox demands at station 6, 7, and 8 when you're already destroyed.\n\n4. **Psychological intensity tools:** In his training groups, he has athletes compete in pull-up contests where the loser runs around the neighborhood naked. Sounds ridiculous, but it creates genuine stakes in training — which transfers to competition readiness.\n\nThe takeaway for you: **develop a race-day persona that's separate from training-you.** You don't need to be \"The Sheriff,\" but having a simple, repeatable mantra — 2-3 words max — that you drill in hard training sessions and deploy on race day is a proven performance tool. Research on alter ego effects in sport psychology backs this up completely."}]}

He suffered **two slipped discs** during his ultramarathon days — he was running 100km races at age 19, did 7 marathons in 7 days, 10 marathons in 5 days — and it caught up with him because he neglected recovery.\n\nHis words: *\"Not prioritising recovery is probably the thing that I regret most.\"*\n\nHere's what he does now:\n\n**Non-negotiables:**\n- **Mobility training** — he calls it a \"game-changer\" and treats it as non-negotiable, not optional. This is built into every training day.\n- **Biometric tracking** — he uses HRV (heart rate variability) and sleep quality data to dictate daily training load. His rule: *\"If the numbers are down, the intensity drops.\"* That's autoregulation based on objective data, not feelings.\n\n**Nutrition protocol:**\n- **Protein:** 1.7-2.2g per kg bodyweight per day\n- **Carbs before training:** bagels, porridge oats, rice, bananas\n- **80/20 rule:** 80% whole foods, 20% flexible\n- **Race day minus 1:** full carb-load\n- **Post-race:** protein shake immediately after finishing — always has it ready\n\n**Supplements:**\n- Caffeine (only before midday during training; unrestricted on race day)\n- Creatine daily\n- Electrolytes — calls them \"non-negotiable\"\n- Bicarbonate of soda gels — he's been testing these as a lactate buffer\n\n**Mental recovery:** He worked with a sports psychologist to manage pre-race anxiety that used to consume him for 2 weeks before competition. The principle he adopted: *\"The race is going to happen no matter what, so there's no point thinking about it two weeks beforehand.\"*\n\nThe lesson for you: **recovery isn't passive rest — it's an active, trackable training variable.**"}]}

I know that's a huge station."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Hunter's sled training is built around **EMOM formats at above-race-weight loads**. Here's his approach:\n\n**Signature Sled Protocol:**\n- **18-minute EMOM:** Alternating sled push and TRX rows, flowing continuously with sustained lactate threshold effort\n- **Training weight:** 425 lbs — that's versus the 340 lb race weight for men's pro. He deliberately overloads by ~25%\n- **Technique:** High-arm position, lean into the sled like a rugby scrum, drive through the legs\n\nHis key principle on lactate management: *\"As soon as lactate starts to form, push a little further and stay there. Don't push so far that performance starts to drop. Sustained burning.\"*\n\nThis is critical — he's not training sled push for max strength. He's training **sustained output at lactate threshold**. The goal is to hold that uncomfortable pace without tipping into catastrophic fatigue.\n\nHis sled work is programmed on **Tuesdays** in the HAOS PRO program — interval-based sled work paired with running and core strengthening. The combination of sled push + TRX rows in the EMOM simulates the push-pull demand of Hyrox stations back to back.\n\nFor comparison, **Rich Ryan's three-pillar approach** provides more structure:\n1. **Strength pillar:** Heavy sled x 3-4 sets of 25m, 4-6 min rest\n2. **Speed pillar:** Lighter sled x 50m unbroken, focus on foot speed\n3. **Lactate tolerance:** Race-weight sled x 37-50m unbroken, long rest (4-6 min), repeat\n\nRyan trains sleds 2x per week with undulating periodization — rotating between heavy/short, light/fast, and long/grindy. He found that 4x per week caused lower leg and foot pain.\n\nFor your prep, I'd recommend starting with Ryan's structured approach while incorporating Hunter's overload principle once your technique is dialed."}]}

Currently chasing a sub-60 Hyrox finish.\n\n**His training structure:**\n- **4-12 sessions per week** depending on the phase\n- AM track workouts (speed sessions, interval running)\n- Midday weight training\n- Hyrox-specific simulation efforts focused on maintaining **Zone 4 heart rate**\n\nWhat makes Churchill valuable as a case study is his **honesty about limitations**: *\"I've never seen myself as an elite athlete.

This is where his Thursday Hyrox Simulation days become critical — full race-specific workouts with transition practice and time trials.\n\nHis three foundational principles of training progression:\n1. **Increase strength and position** — progressive overload with heavier loads\n2. **Increase speed and position** — faster reps at higher resistance\n3. **Increase endurance and position** — add more volume over time\n\nHe tackles these sequentially, not simultaneously. That's a block periodization approach at its core.\n\nCompare this to **Jake Dearden's model** which keeps running and strength separate until 5-6 weeks out then integrates. Hunter integrates earlier (Phase 2, week 5) but with dedicated simulation days rather than blending every session.\n\nFor your 16-week prep: I'd borrow Hunter's 3-phase structure but extend Phase 1 to 6 weeks given you're converting from pure strength to hybrid work.

His reasoning:\n\n*\"Starting off with your SkiErg — that's the most important exercise. If your heart rate skyrockets at the ski and you struggle, that's going to fatigue you for the rest of the race. But if you get fatigued at the burpees [the fourth station], you've had a good first half of the race.\"*\n\nThis is a **cascading fatigue argument**. Station 1 affects all 7 remaining stations plus all 8 runs. Station 8 (wall balls) only affects your finish. So the ROI of training early stations is exponentially higher.\n\nHis station hierarchy (implied from his training emphasis):\n1. **SkiErg** — sets the tone for the entire race\n2. **Sled push/pull** — massive energy cost, technique-dependent\n3. **Rowing** — similar to SkiErg in cardiac demand\n4. **Everything else** — important but less race-defining\n\nThe other critical Dearden framework: he treats **each station + the following run as one combined exercise**. So when he trains SkiErg, he's not just thinking about 1,000m on the machine — he's thinking about 1,000m on the SkiErg AND the 1km run that follows it.\n\nHis training reflects this:\n- **Week 1:** 12 x 250m SkiErg intervals with 45 seconds rest — consistent, repeatable pace across all 12 efforts\n- **Week 2:** 3 rounds of 500m SkiErg + 20m sled push at Hyrox weight, 90 seconds rest\n- **Week 3:** 1,000m SkiErg in a 5-minute window (race simulation)\n\nNotice the progression: isolated intervals, then combined stations, then race-pace simulation. That's textbook specificity progression.\n\nFor your prep, this means **SkiErg conditioning should start early and stay consistent**. Don't save it for race-specific blocks."}]}

The most detailed strategy comes from **Rich Ryan**, who has the most comprehensive wall ball guide in the Hyrox space:\n\n**Set/Rep Strategy:**\n- If you can do **50+ unbroken**: do the big set first, then manage the remainder\n- If not: pick a sustainable number (25, 15, or even 5) and maintain **consistent rest intervals** throughout all 100 reps\n- Key principle: *\"Stay just under your threshold for your high-end ability\"*\n\n**Breathing Protocol (this is counter-intuitive):**\n- **Exhale on release** (throwing the ball up)\n- **Inhale on catch/descent**\n- This flips the traditional Valsalva squat breathing — allows continuous breathing through full range of motion, improves O2 intake, reduces ventilation rate spikes\n\n**Arm Recovery Technique:**\n- After throwing, **drop arms down to sides or swing out** to promote blood flow to shoulders\n- Do NOT hold arms overhead waiting for the ball\n- Catch position: under the chin, not above the head\n\n**Mental Visualization:**\n- Treat every 10 reps as 100m on a running track\n- At 60 reps: *\"I just have 40 left, which is like 400m. I will never stop in my last 400.\"*\n\n**Hunter McIntyre's approach** uses overload: he trains with **20lb wall balls** versus the competition standard, and programs 15 wall balls per minute in EMOM format. His emphasis: take micro breaks, collect yourself, then attack again — don't slog through slow reps.\n\n**Jake Dearden's 3-week progression:**\n- Week 1: 4 sets of 30 reps in 3-minute windows\n- Week 2: 3 rounds of 50 reps + 500m run + 50 reps\n- Week 3: 100 for time (race simulation)\n\nMy recommendation: start drilling that breathing pattern NOW. It takes weeks to override your instincts, but it makes a massive difference at rep 70+ when your lungs are on fire."}]}

NYC Hyrox Simulation Workout:**\n- 18-minute EMOM: Sled push + TRX rows, alternating between 2-minute hard efforts with 1-minute rest or continuous flow\n- Then: 5 rounds of 20-cal row + 20 burpees, aiming for each round to fit within ~1 minute of work\n\n**2. Training Camp AMRAP (Episode 6):**\n- 20-25 minute AMRAP: 25 TRX rows, sled pull, 30 shoulder presses\n- 10-15 minute active recovery on the bike between sets\n- Choose shoulder press weight where you can hit 20 unbroken\n\n**3. The 20-Rep Squat Protocol:**\n- Pick a weight you think you'd be lucky to get 10 reps with\n- Don't stop until you've done 20\n- This is an 8-week cycle — Hunter credits it for building the strength-endurance base that fuels his Hyrox dominance\n\n**4. The Lumberjack Workout:**\n- 10 minutes of wood chopping (or sledgehammer tire slams as a sub)\n- 5 minutes of heavy object pushing/pulling\n- 5 rounds: 30 seconds max-effort tire slams / 30 seconds rest\n- 3-5 x 200-foot steep hill climbs carrying a 50-100 lb sandbag\n\n**5. Cold Bar Challenge (test, not regular training):**\n- No warm-up: 15 pull-ups with a 50 lb weight vest\n- This tests neural readiness and grip under non-ideal conditions\n\n**My recommendation for you:** Start with workout #1 but scale the sled weight to 60-70% of competition weight and cut the EMOM to 12 minutes. The row + burpee portion — try 15 cals + 15 burpees per round. The 20-rep squat protocol is excellent for your strength-to-endurance conversion — start at 60% of your back squat 1RM and build weekly."}]}

It goes beyond the gym:\n\n**Five Core Principles:**\n1. **Know your WHY** — use your purpose to fuel effort\n2. **Focus on what you can control**\n3. **Work hard**\n4. **Switch gears** — be fully present in each task\n5. **Re-evaluate** — adjust priorities as life changes\n\nHis description: *\"Taking as many reps as possible of the task in front of you, giving it your best, and then moving on to the next task, and repeat.\"*\n\n**How this applies to Hyrox:** Khalipa competed in HYROX Dallas Pro Doubles in 2024 with Gabe Yanez, finishing in **1:07:13**. His YouTube series was literally titled \"CrossFit Games Champion **Humbled** By HYROX\" — which tells you everything about the learning curve.\n\nThe AMRAP mentality actually transfers well to Hyrox's station-run-station format. Each station is its own AMRAP-like effort where you need to be fully present, execute efficiently, and then switch gears to running. The \"switch gears\" principle is particularly relevant — the mental transition from station to run is where most athletes lose time.\n\nHowever, Khalipa's biggest lesson was that **Hyrox punishes the CrossFit instinct to go all-out**. His partner Gabe Yanez went too hard on burpees, and Khalipa observed: Gabe came out of that run thinking their race was over — Jason was actually pulling away from him.\n\nKhalipa's current training reflects his evolution from pure competitor to **\"protector and provider\"** athlete — limited training hours, maximum fitness return on investment. His TRAIN HARD platform is built around this: early AM cardio/ruck walks, midday NCFIT workouts, BJJ 3x/week. At a minimum, he goes for a long walk every day.\n\nFor Hyrox application: the AMRAP mentality works IF you add **pacing discipline** on top. Full presence, full effort — but effort calibrated to 60-minute sustained output, not 12-minute redline."}]}

You don't need Hunter's volume. You need his **structure** compressed into your available hours.\n\nHere's how I'd translate his 6-day HAOS PRO framework into your 8-10 hour window:\n\n**Your Adapted Weekly Split (5-6 training days):**\n\n| Day | Session (60-90 min) | Key Adaptation |\n|-----|---------------------|----------------|\n| **Monday** | Heavy Strength (45 min) + 20-min EMOM finisher | Mirrors Hunter's Monday — deadlift or squat focus, then a short conditioning piece |\n| **Tuesday** | Interval Run (6-8 miles with tempo or threshold segments) | Hunter's Tuesday running focus — but you don't need the accessories since you're already strong |\n| **Wednesday** | HIIT/Power Session (45-60 min) — convert one of your gym days to EMOM/AMRAP format | This is the critical shift: Hunter's Wednesday full body power, adapted as hybrid conditioning |\n| **Thursday** | Hyrox Simulation (60-75 min) — THE key session | Straight from Hunter: race-specific workout with transitions. Non-negotiable. |\n| **Friday** | Easy run (5-6 miles, Zone 2) + mobility | Active recovery — Dearden's Friday approach |\n| **Saturday** | Long run (8-12 miles) OR strength endurance session | Alternate weekly |\n\n**The critical conversion:** You need to shift 2-3 of your current strength days from traditional hypertrophy to **HIIT-style formats** — EMOMs, AMRAPs, intervals. This is where Hunter's session design is gold. A 20-minute EMOM of sled pushes + wall balls + rowing hits strength endurance AND aerobic capacity simultaneously.\n\n**Weekly hours breakdown:** ~4-5 hours running + 4-5 hours gym/conditioning = 8-10 hours total. That's enough to build a competitive Hyrox foundation with your existing fitness level."}]}

So two 30-minute sessions can be compressed into one 50-60 minute session with smart programming.\n\nHere's how to replicate his weekly stimulus in single daily sessions:\n\n**Monday (60 min):** 5K progression run (25 min) + strength supersets (30 min) — combine his AM run and PM strength into one session. Run first when fresh, then hit compound lifts.\n\n**Tuesday (75 min):** Strength circuit (30 min) flowing directly into a 40-min Hyrox engine session. This actually mirrors his Tuesday but compressed. The fatigue carryover from strength into the Hyrox work is a BONUS — it simulates running under fatigue.\n\n**Wednesday (45 min):** Row intervals — 10 x 500m with 2 min rest. This is already a single session in his plan. Execute exactly as written.\n\n**Thursday (60 min):** 10K progression run. Single session, no modification needed. Run at RPE 6-7, building to RPE 8 in the final 2K.\n\n**Friday:** Rest or 30 min Zone 2 bike. Match his recovery day exactly.\n\n**Saturday (75 min):** Strength + Hyrox combo — his Saturday team sweat session. Program 30 min of strength followed by a 40-min Hyrox AMRAP.\n\n**Sunday (60 min):** 50-min AMRAP with running and Hyrox exercises. Direct copy of his Sunday session.\n\n**Total weekly hours:** ~7-8 hours. You're getting 85-90% of Dearden's training stimulus because the actual work is the same — you're just eliminating the recovery gap between AM/PM splits."}]}

How should I approach it?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Smart concern. Hunter's 20-rep squat protocol is a **powerful strength-endurance builder**, but you need to modify it because your legs are already under significant running load that Hunter's weren't designed around.\n\nHere's the protocol as Hunter prescribes it: pick a weight you think you'd be lucky to get 10 reps with, then don't stop until you've done 20. It's an 8-week cycle.\n\n**My adapted version for a 35-40 mpw runner:**\n\n**Week 1-2: Foundation**\n- Start at **50% of your back squat 1RM** (not the 60-65% Hunter implies)\n- Do the 20 reps, but allow 2-3 breath pauses after rep 12 if needed\n- Perform on **Monday only** — maximum distance from your long run (Saturday/Sunday)\n- RPE target: 7-8 by rep 20\n\n**Week 3-4: Build**\n- Add 5-10 lbs per week\n- RPE target: 8-9 by rep 20\n- Monitor your Tuesday/Wednesday runs — if pace drops more than 15-20 sec/mile from normal, you've overloaded\n\n**Week 5-6: Peak Loading**\n- You should be at approximately 55-60% 1RM for 20 reps\n- This is where the magic happens for Hyrox: your legs learn to produce force under extreme metabolic fatigue\n- Reduce your Monday easy run to 3-4 miles max as a warm-up before squatting\n\n**Week 7-8: Maintain and Taper**\n- Hold the weight steady, focus on reducing rest-pauses\n- By week 8, aim for 20 unbroken at the working weight\n\n**Critical safeguards:**\n- **Never do this the day before or after a hard running session** (tempo, intervals, long run)\n- **Front squats are an alternative** — they limit load naturally and are more knee-friendly\n- **One set only** — this is not 3x20. It's one brutal set, then accessory work\n- Keep your total weekly mileage steady — don't increase running volume during this cycle\n\nThe why: at 35-40 mpw, your legs already have high accumulated training stress. Hunter can absorb the 20-rep squat because he's not running that volume. You need the lower starting percentage to avoid overuse injury to knees and hip flexors."}]}

Rich Ryan's 3-pillar system — strength, speed, and lactate tolerance — is the gold standard, but you can adapt it for once-a-week sled access plus substitutes on other days.\n\n**Your once-a-week sled session (rotate through pillars every 3 weeks):**\n\n**Week A — Strength Pillar:**\n- Heavy sled push: 4 x 25m at Hyrox weight + 20-30%, 4-6 min rest\n- Heavy sled pull: 4 x 25m at Hyrox weight + 20-30%, 4-6 min rest\n- Total time: 25-30 min\n\n**Week B — Speed Pillar:**\n- Light sled push: 6 x 50m at 60% race weight, focus on foot turnover speed, 3 min rest\n- Light sled pull: 6 x 50m at 60% race weight, 3 min rest\n- Total time: 30-35 min\n\n**Week C — Lactate Tolerance Pillar:**\n- Race-weight sled push: 3 x 50m unbroken at all costs, 4-6 min rest\n- Race-weight sled pull: 3 x 50m unbroken at all costs, 4-6 min rest\n- Then: 800m run immediately after final pull (compromised running practice)\n- Total time: 30-35 min\n\n**Home/regular gym substitutes (2x per week):**\n\nSled push replacement:\n- **Heavy prowler push or plate push** if available\n- **Banded marches:** Loop a heavy band around your waist, anchor it, march forward with the same drive angle as a sled push — 4 x 30 seconds, 90s rest\n- **Wall pushes with band resistance:** Drive into a wall at 45-degree angle, knees driving, 5 x 20 seconds\n\nSled pull replacement:\n- **Heavy rope pulls** (battle rope hand-over-hand, seated)\n- **Cable face pulls + reverse sled drag simulation:** Attach band to rig, walk backward with same arm mechanics as sled pull — 4 x 25m equivalent\n\nThe key insight from Rich Ryan is that sled work is **almost entirely concentric** — no eccentric loading means faster recovery than squats or deadlifts. That's why he can train it 2x per week without crushing his legs. Your substitutes should also be concentric-dominant to replicate this recovery advantage."}]}

Here's how I'd structure it for your specific situation — 35-40 mpw runner, 4-5 gym days:\n\n**Phase 1: Base + Separation (Weeks 16-11, six weeks)**\n\nRunning and strength stay completely separate sessions.\n\n- **Running (4x/week):** Maintain 35-40 mpw\n  - 2 easy runs (Zone 2, 6-8 miles)\n  - 1 tempo/threshold run (4-6 miles with 2-3 miles at threshold pace)\n  - 1 long run (10-12 miles, easy effort)\n- **Strength (3x/week):** Convert to Hyrox-relevant movements\n  - Day 1: Heavy lower (squats, deadlifts, lunges) — RPE 8-9\n  - Day 2: Upper + core (pull-ups, shoulder press, rows, wall balls) — RPE 7-8\n  - Day 3: Hyrox stations — SkiErg intervals, rowing intervals, sled work (isolated, not combined with running)\n\n**Phase 2: Hyrox-Specific + Early Integration (Weeks 10-6, five weeks)**\n\nOne session per week combines running with station work. Following Dearden's principle.\n\n- **Running:** Drop to 30-35 mpw (trade one easy run for a compromised run session)\n- **Compromised Run Session:** 800m run at race pace, immediately into sled push (50m), 800m run, into rowing (500m), 800m run, into wall balls (50 reps). This trains the station-to-run transition that Dearden emphasizes.\n- **Strength:** Maintain 3x/week but shift Day 3 to full Hyrox simulation — 40-60 minute AMRAPs incorporating multiple stations\n\n**Phase 3: Race-Specific Peak (Weeks 5-2, four weeks)**\n\nNow you're in Dearden's integration zone — 2 sessions per week combine running under fatigue.\n\n- **Running:** 25-30 mpw (quality over quantity)\n- **2x combined sessions:** Strength work flowing directly into 3-5K runs at race pace\n- **1x partial or full race simulation** every 10-14 days\n- **1x Hyrox AMRAP** (50-min format, like Dearden's Sunday session)\n\n**Race Week (Week 1):**\n- Monday: Easy 3-mile run + light station practice\n- Tuesday: 20-min easy EMOM at 50% effort\n- Wednesday: Rest\n- Thursday: 2-mile shakeout jog\n- Friday: Rest\n- Saturday/Sunday: RACE\n\nThis gives you 6 weeks of pure base, 5 weeks of progressive integration, and 4 weeks of race-specific peaking — exactly aligned with Dearden's philosophy."}]}

I'm already a strong runner at 35-40 mpw — should I be worried about the running or focus more on stations?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"This is the most important strategic question for your profile. Churchill's lesson — *\"I underestimated the running. It's 70% of the event\"* — is valid for most people. But **you're not most people.**\n\nAt 35-40 miles per week, your aerobic engine is already well above the typical Hyrox competitor. Here's how to think about your specific situation:\n\n**Your running advantage:**\n- 8km of running in Hyrox at a moderate-hard pace is roughly 32-40 minutes for a competitive finisher\n- With your mileage base, you likely have a solid lactate threshold and can sustain 4:30-5:00/km pace through the runs\n- This is a genuine competitive edge — most Hyrox athletes come from CrossFit/strength backgrounds and struggle with the running\n\n**Where you should focus instead:**\n\n1. **Station efficiency (60% of your Hyrox-specific training):**\n   - Sled push/pull technique and lactate tolerance — this is where races are won or lost\n   - Wall ball endurance — 100 reps at the end of the race when you're cooked\n   - SkiErg and rowing power output — these are the stations that spike your HR the most\n   - Burpee broad jump movement economy — reducing wasted energy per rep\n\n2. **Compromised running (25% of your training):**\n   - This is NOT regular running. It's running AFTER station work with an elevated HR\n   - Churchill's key insight: *\"Going from a run into burpee broad jumps is a different beast\"*\n   - Practice: 1km run at race pace immediately after completing 50 wall balls or a sled push\n   - The skill here is **getting back into rhythm** after your heart rate has been jacked up by a station\n\n3. **Maintain your running base (15%):**\n   - Don't drop below 25-30 mpw — you need to protect your aerobic engine\n   - Trade volume for quality: fewer easy miles, more race-pace and threshold work\n\n**Bottom line:** Your running base is your superpower. Don't neglect it, but don't over-invest in it either. The marginal gains for you come from station proficiency and the ability to transition cleanly between stations and runs without losing pace."}]}

Here's a practical workout built directly on that principle:\n\n**\"Station-Run Coupling\" Workout (60-70 min total)**\n\nWarm-up: 10 min easy jog + dynamic stretching\n\n**Block 1: SkiErg + Run Coupling**\n- 1,000m SkiErg at race pace (target: 3:30-4:00)\n- Immediately: 1km run at race pace (target: 4:30-5:00/km)\n- **Rest: 3 min** — note your run split\n\n**Block 2: Sled Push + Run Coupling**\n- 50m sled push at race weight (or 4 x 25m with quick resets)\n- Immediately: 1km run at race pace\n- **Rest: 3 min** — note your run split\n\n**Block 3: Row + Run Coupling**\n- 1,000m row at race pace (target: 3:30-4:00)\n- Immediately: 1km run at race pace\n- **Rest: 3 min** — note your run split\n\n**Block 4: Wall Balls + Run Coupling**\n- 50 wall balls at race weight (break as needed)\n- Immediately: 1km run at race pace\n- **Rest: 3 min** — note your run split\n\n**What to track:**\nCompare your run splits after each station. The gap between your fastest and slowest post-station km tells you where your coupling weakness is. If your km after sled push is 30+ seconds slower than after SkiErg, that's your priority.\n\n**Progression over 6 weeks:**\n- Weeks 1-2: 4 blocks as above, 3 min rest between blocks\n- Weeks 3-4: 4 blocks, reduce rest to 2 min\n- Weeks 5-6: 6 blocks (add farmers carry + run and burpee broad jumps + run), 2 min rest\n\n**RPE targets:** Stations at RPE 7-8, runs at RPE 7. You should feel uncomfortable but sustainable. If your run pace degrades by more than 20 seconds per km across blocks, you went too hard on the stations.\n\nThis is exactly what Dearden means by late-stage integration — and it's why he saves this type of training for the final 5-6 weeks before a race. The neural and metabolic demand of constantly resetting from station to run is very high."}]}

Let me put your numbers in context:\n\n**Your strength vs. Hyrox demands:**\n\n| Hyrox Station | Load Requirement | Your Relevant Strength | Assessment |\n|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|------------|\n| Sled Push | 152 kg / 335 lbs (Pro Men) | 275 squat, 365 deadlift | Overqualified — leg strength is not your limiter |\n| Sled Pull | 103 kg / 227 lbs (Pro Men) | 365 deadlift, strong posterior chain | More than enough |\n| Wall Balls | 9 kg / 20 lbs (Pro Men), 100 reps | 225 bench, 275 squat | Strength isn't the issue — endurance is |\n| Farmers Carry | 2 x 24 kg / 53 lbs each (Pro Men), 200m | Any of your lifts | Trivially easy from a strength perspective |\n| Sandbag Lunges | 20 kg / 44 lbs (Pro Men), 100m | 275 squat | No concern |\n\nHunter McIntyre has said Hyrox is *\"almost all legs\"* — and your legs are already well-developed. The sled is the heaviest station demand and at 335 lbs, it's below your squat. You won't be grinding through strength failure on any station.\n\n**What you ACTUALLY need:**\n1. **Strength endurance** — not 1RM strength. Can you do 100 wall balls at 20 lbs without your shoulders dying? Can you push a sled for 50m unbroken without your legs locking up?\n2. **Lactate tolerance** — the ability to sustain moderate-high effort for 55-75 minutes\n3. **Movement economy** — doing each station rep with minimum wasted energy\n\n**My recommendation:** Stop chasing PRs in the squat and deadlift for the next 16 weeks. Maintain your current strength with 2 heavy sessions per week (3x5 at 80% 1RM), and redirect the remaining gym time to:\n- High-rep strength endurance work (20+ rep sets, EMOM formats)\n- Hyrox station practice at race weight\n- Conditioning circuits that combine strength movements with aerobic demand\n\nYou're converting existing strength into **usable race fitness**. That's a much better position than being weak and trying to build strength while also training stations."}]}

Dearden's principle is simple and powerful: *\"If the numbers are down, the intensity drops.\"*\n\nHere's how to operationalize that for your Hyrox prep:\n\n**Step 1: Establish your baseline (first 2 weeks)**\n- Wear the Whoop 24/7, including sleep\n- Track your average HRV, resting heart rate (RHR), and recovery score\n- Note your HRV on rest days vs. training days\n- Your baseline HRV will likely settle around a consistent range — this is your personal normal\n\n**Step 2: Create decision rules**\n\n| Recovery Score | HRV vs. Baseline | Training Adjustment |\n|---------------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| **Green (67-100%)** | HRV at or above baseline | Execute planned session as written — full intensity, full volume |\n| **Yellow (34-66%)** | HRV 10-20% below baseline | Reduce intensity by one tier: swap threshold run for tempo run, reduce EMOM weight by 10%, keep volume same |\n| **Red (0-33%)** | HRV 20%+ below baseline | Active recovery only: Zone 2 run (30 min), mobility work, light erg work. No threshold or heavy sessions. |\n\n**Step 3: Track weekly patterns**\n- After 4-6 weeks, you'll see clear patterns: which sessions tank your recovery, which you absorb easily\n- Use this data to **place your hardest sessions** (Hyrox simulations, threshold runs, heavy strength) on days following your best recovery scores\n- Track cumulative strain — if your 7-day strain exceeds your typical by 20%+, schedule an extra rest day regardless of daily score\n\n**Step 4: Dearden's autoregulation in practice**\n- Your Thursday Hyrox simulation is your most important weekly session\n- If your Wednesday recovery score is red, move the simulation to Friday and do Zone 2 work on Thursday\n- Never do 2 consecutive red days of high-intensity work — this is where overtraining begins\n\n**The key insight:** HRV doesn't tell you whether to train. It tells you **how hard** to train. Even on red days, Dearden still moves — he just drops intensity. The Whoop is a guardrail, not an excuse to skip sessions."}]}

I currently eat pretty clean but don't really track anything. I'm about 180 lbs, running 35-40 mpw plus lifting."},{"role":"assistant","content":"At 180 lbs with your training volume, you need a **structured fueling strategy**. Let me pull from what the elites do and adapt it for your situation.\n\n**Calorie target: approximately 3,200-3,600 calories per day**\n\nHere's the reasoning: Hunter McIntyre eats 4,500-5,500 at 205 lbs training 16-20 hours/week. Jake Dearden targets 1.7-2.2g protein per kg. Dan Churchill realized he was under-fueling and it was hurting his Zone 2 performance. The common thread: **Hyrox athletes under-eat carbs.**\n\n**Macro framework for you at 180 lbs (82 kg):**\n\n| Macro | Daily Target | Reasoning |\n|-------|-------------|----------|\n| **Protein** | 145-180g (1.8-2.2g/kg) | Dearden's range — supports muscle recovery from both running and strength |\n| **Carbs** | 350-450g | This is non-negotiable. Your running plus strength work demands high glycogen. Churchill's biggest mistake was eating \"just a banana\" before training |\n| **Fat** | 70-85g | Sufficient for hormonal health without slowing digestion around training |\n\n**Meal timing (borrowed from Churchill and Dearden):**\n\n- **Pre-training (2-3 hours before):** High carb, moderate protein, low fat. Dearden's go-to: bagels, porridge oats, rice, bananas. Aim for 80-100g carbs.\n- **During long sessions (60+ min):** 30-60g carbs per hour — gels, sports drink, or banana. Practice this in training, not just race day.\n- **Post-training (within 30 min):** Dearden always has a protein shake ready immediately. Target 30-40g protein + 50-60g carbs.\n- **Before bed:** Avoid dense protein and high-fat meals within 2 hours of sleep (Churchill's protocol). This improves sleep quality, which cascades into better recovery.\n\n**Supplements worth considering:**\n- **Creatine** — 5g daily (Dearden takes it daily)\n- **Electrolytes** — Dearden calls them \"non-negotiable,\" especially during long sessions\n- **Caffeine** — Dearden restricts it to before midday during training but goes unrestricted on race day. Smart strategy to maintain caffeine sensitivity for when it matters.\n\n**Race week:** Carb-load the day before (Dearden's approach) — increase carbs to 500-550g, reduce fiber, reduce fat. This tops off glycogen stores for the 55-75 minute effort."}]}

Your CrossFit base is a genuine advantage — but Hyrox will humble you in specific ways. Jason Khalipa, a CrossFit Games Champion, titled his Hyrox YouTube series *\"CrossFit Games Champion Humbled By HYROX.\"*\n\n**What transfers directly from your CrossFit background:**\n- **Wall balls** — identical movement, you've done hundreds. But Hyrox demands 100 reps at the END of a 55+ minute effort, not fresh in a metcon\n- **SkiErg and rowing** — you know these machines. Your sub-7 2K row is solid\n- **Work capacity and mental toughness** — CrossFit's DNA. You know how to suffer\n- **Strength base** — you're almost certainly overqualified for Hyrox station loads\n\n**Where you'll get exposed:**\n\n1. **Running volume.** Hyrox has 8km of running. Khalipa's observation: *\"It's a lot of running.\"* CrossFit rarely programs runs over 1 mile. You need to build to 25-35km per week of running.\n\n2. **Pacing discipline.** This is the #1 killer. Gabe Yanez (Khalipa's doubles partner) went too hard on burpees, then fell apart on the run: *\"I did so many burpees and so fast that we came out of that run and I thought our race was over.\"* Going 10-15 seconds faster on a station costs you 2+ minutes on the subsequent run.\n\n3. **Sled pull technique.** Khalipa identified this as the biggest skill gap for CrossFitters. It's not a standard CrossFit movement.\n\n4. **Sustained threshold effort.** Your Fran is a ~3-minute redline effort. Hyrox is 55-75+ minutes. Rich Ryan put it perfectly: *\"Moving into a 60+ minute race is a different style of training.\"*\n\n5. **Transition management.** Running into a station with a 170+ BPM heart rate and immediately executing efficient reps is a learned skill.\n\n**Your 8-week quick-start plan:**\n- Add 3-4 runs per week (2 easy Zone 2, 1 tempo, 1 interval)\n- Build running to 25-35km per week\n- Introduce sled pull technique 2x/week\n- Maintain 1-2 CrossFit-style sessions (reduce Olympic lifting volume)\n- Practice pacing: everything at RPE 7, not RPE 10"}]}

Do I need to keep doing cleans and snatches?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Short answer: **no.** You can drop or significantly reduce Olympic lifting for Hyrox prep without any performance loss.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n**What Olympic lifts give you:**\n- Explosive power development (rate of force development)\n- Full-body coordination\n- Posterior chain strength\n\n**What Hyrox actually demands:**\n- Sustained moderate-intensity output over 55-75 minutes\n- Lactate tolerance and threshold capacity\n- Movement efficiency at sub-maximal loads for high reps\n- Running economy and aerobic capacity\n\nThere's almost zero overlap between a 1RM power clean and pushing a sled for 50 meters at race weight. The energy systems are completely different.\n\nRich Froning's training template shows his CrossFit approach: heavy cleans and snatches 2x per week each, separate from conditioning. But even he acknowledged that moving toward endurance events requires fundamentally different programming.\n\n**What to replace Oly lifts with:**\n\n| Drop This | Replace With | Why |\n|-----------|-------------|-----|\n| Power cleans | Kettlebell swings (5 x 15, RPE 7) | Same hip hinge pattern, more reps, builds posterior chain endurance |\n| Snatches | Dumbbell thrusters (4 x 12, RPE 7) | Full-body movement that mimics wall ball pattern |\n| Clean & Jerk complexes | Sled push + sled pull EMOM (15 min) | Direct Hyrox station practice |\n| Squat cleans | 20-rep back squats at moderate weight | Builds the specific leg endurance Hyrox demands |\n\n**The exception:** If you enjoy Olympic lifting for mental health and training enjoyment, keep one session per week as a \"fun\" day at moderate loads (70-75% 1RM). Training adherence matters more than theoretical optimization. But don't program it as a performance priority — it's maintenance at best.\n\nRedirect that freed-up time and energy toward **running volume and Hyrox station practice**.

I'm used to just going hard the whole time."},{"role":"assistant","content":"This is the **single biggest adjustment** CrossFit athletes need to make for Hyrox. The difference is not just duration — it's a fundamentally different energy system strategy.\n\n**CrossFit metcon pacing:**\n- Duration: 8-20 minutes typically\n- Strategy: Start hard, manage the fade, sprint the finish\n- Energy system: Primarily anaerobic glycolytic + aerobic power\n- RPE: 8-10 for most of the workout\n- Recovery: You're done. Lie on the floor.\n\n**Hyrox race pacing:**\n- Duration: 55-75+ minutes\n- Strategy: Start controlled, maintain consistency, negative split if possible\n- Energy system: Primarily aerobic with repeated anaerobic surges at stations\n- RPE: 6-7 for runs, 7-8 for stations, never 10 until the final wall balls\n- Recovery: There IS no recovery — you go from station directly into the next 1km run\n\nRich Ryan crystallized this: *\"If you take a triathlete and a CrossFitter and make them do a Hyrox, the CrossFitter probably wins the first one. But if you train for Hyrox for a year, the triathlete is going to win the next one.\"*\n\n**The critical mistake** from Khalipa's Pro Doubles race: his partner Gabe Yanez crushed the burpees — went fast, felt great — then imploded on the subsequent run. The math is brutal: saving 10-15 seconds on a station costs 2+ minutes on the run that follows.\n\n**How to train Hyrox pacing:**\n\n1. **The 70% rule:** For your first 4 weeks of Hyrox training, do every station at 70% of your max capacity. Time it. Then run 1km. Compare your run split to a fresh 1km. If the gap is more than 20 seconds, you went too hard on the station.\n\n2. **Negative split practice:** In simulation workouts, deliberately run your first 4 kms 10 seconds/km slower than your last 4 kms. This teaches restraint early in the race.\n\n3. **Heart rate caps:** Keep your HR below 85% of max during runs, allow it to spike to 90-92% during stations, and practice bringing it back down within 200 meters of the subsequent run.\n\n4. **The \"Hyrox is an endurance event\" mantra:** Repeat this until it overrides your CrossFit instincts. You are NOT doing a metcon. You are doing a **60-minute threshold endurance race** with strength elements embedded inside it."}]}

His signature workouts include 18-minute EMOMs with sled pushes and TRX rows, and 20-25 minute AMRAPs with station-specific movements.

Maintain your strength without chasing PRs.\n- **Convert:** 2 gym days become **Hyrox station practice + HIIT conditioning:**\n  - Day A: SkiErg intervals (8 x 250m, 45s rest) + sled technique work (light weight, 6 x 25m) + wall ball practice (4 x 25 reps, 90s rest)\n  - Day B: 30-min Hyrox EMOM — rotate through 3-4 stations every minute\n- **Running:** Maintain 30-35 mpw.

I could barely move it. My running splits after were like 30 seconds slower than normal. What am I doing wrong?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"First off — good. Now you know where the gap is. Let me diagnose this:\n\n**Sled push failure usually comes from one of three things:**\n\n1. **Technique, not strength.** This is the most common issue for first-timers. If you were pushing with a high body angle (too upright), you're fighting gravity instead of using it. Hunter McIntyre's technique: lean into the sled like a rugby scrum, high-arm position, drive through the legs with a forward lean angle of about 45 degrees.\n\n2. **Going too fast too early.** Did you sprint the first 10-15 meters? Classic mistake. Rich Ryan's lactate tolerance protocol emphasizes **sustained output, not sprinting.** Hunter's principle: *\"Push a little further and stay there. Don't push so far that performance starts to drop.\"*\n\n3. **Leg pre-fatigue from the run.** What was your heart rate when you hit the sled? If you came in at 175+ BPM from a hard 1km, your legs were already acidotic before you touched the handles.\n\nTell me: what weight was the sled, and how long did it take you to complete 50m? Also, what was your running pace for the 1km before the sled push?"},{"role":"user","content":"The sled was at competition weight — about 335 lbs. It took me close to 2 minutes to do 50m and I had to stop 3 times. My run before was around 4:20/km pace. After the sled my run was like 5:10/km."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Alright, this tells me a lot. Let me break it down:\n\n**Your 1km pre-sled at 4:20/km is TOO FAST for your first simulation.** That's close to threshold pace for most athletes. You burned your legs before you even touched the sled. Jake Dearden's principle applies here: he views the station + the following run as ONE exercise. So your actual pacing unit is: 1km run + sled push + 1km run = one combined effort.\n\n**The sled itself at 2 minutes with 3 stops:** For reference, elite men finish 50m sled push in 25-40 seconds. A good competitive time is 45-60 seconds. 2 minutes with 3 stops means technique and pacing are the issues, not raw strength — your legs are strong enough with a 315 squat.\n\n**Here's your sled fix plan:**\n\n**Technique drill (do this first, before any heavy sled work):**\n- Empty or light sled (100-150 lbs)\n- 10 x 15m pushes with 60s rest\n- Focus on: 45-degree lean, arms locked on high handles, short choppy steps (not long strides), driving through the balls of your feet\n- Film yourself from the side — your back should be nearly flat, not arched up\n\n**6-week sled progression (2x per week):**\n\n| Week | Session A (Technique + Speed) | Session B (Lactate Tolerance) |\n|------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| 1-2 | 6 x 25m at 60% race weight, 2 min rest | 4 x 25m at race weight, 3 min rest |\n| 3-4 | 4 x 50m at 60% race weight, 2 min rest | 3 x 50m at race weight, 4 min rest, aim for unbroken |\n| 5-6 | 3 x 50m at race weight, focus on speed, 3 min rest | 2 x 50m at race weight + 20% (overload), 5 min rest |\n\n**Running adjustment:** Slow your pre-sled 1km to **4:45-5:00/km** pace. Yes, that feels slow. But your post-sled run will be 4:50-5:00 instead of 5:10, and your TOTAL time across run + sled + run will be faster. This is the pacing discipline that separates competitive Hyrox athletes from CrossFit-style redliners.\n\n**Target by race day:** 50m sled push in 50-65 seconds, unbroken, with a post-sled 1km run under 5:00/km."}]}

But Hyrox has specific demands that Orange Theory doesn't prepare you for.\n\n**What transfers from your current training:**\n- Aerobic capacity from running — this is your biggest asset\n- Heart rate zone training from OT — you understand zone-based effort\n- General conditioning and work capacity\n- Comfort with high heart rates during mixed-modal work\n\n**What's missing:**\n- **Hyrox-specific station skills:** Sled push, sled pull, SkiErg, burpee broad jumps at race distances and weights\n- **Strength endurance under sustained fatigue:** OT workouts are 45-60 minutes but with built-in recovery. Hyrox is 60-90 minutes with NO programmed rest.\n- **Running under fatigue:** OT treadmill intervals are short bursts. Hyrox requires eight 1km runs between stations with elevated heart rate.\n\nLet me ask: when is your race, and do you have access to a gym with Hyrox equipment (sled, SkiErg, rowing machine)?"},{"role":"user","content":"Race is in 14 weeks. There's a Hyrox-specific gym about 20 minutes from me that I could go to on weekends.

Here's your plan:\n\n**Weekly Structure (6 training days):**\n\n| Day | Session | Location |\n|-----|---------|----------|\n| **Monday** | Easy run — 4-5 miles, Zone 2 | Outdoor/treadmill |\n| **Tuesday** | Orange Theory (keep this) | OT studio |\n| **Wednesday** | Strength + Hyrox substitutes — see below | Regular gym |\n| **Thursday** | Tempo run — 4 miles with 2 miles at half marathon pace | Outdoor |\n| **Friday** | Rest or 30-min easy spin | Home/gym |\n| **Saturday** | Hyrox station practice — THE key session | Hyrox gym |\n| **Sunday** | Long run — 6-8 miles, easy | Outdoor |\n\n**Wednesday at your regular gym (60 min):**\n- 4 x 12 goblet squats at RPE 7 (leg endurance for wall balls and lunges)\n- 4 x 15 dumbbell shoulder press (wall ball shoulder prep)\n- 4 x 20 seated cable rows heavy (sled pull substitute)\n- 100 wall balls for time if your gym has a wall ball setup. If not: 100 thrusters with 15-20 lb dumbbells\n- 3 x 1,000m row at race pace with 2 min rest\n\n**Saturday at Hyrox gym (75-90 min):**\n\n*Weeks 1-5:* Station skill building\n- Sled push technique: 6 x 25m at race weight (102 kg for Women's Pro), 2 min rest\n- Sled pull technique: 6 x 25m, 2 min rest\n- SkiErg intervals: 8 x 250m, 45s rest (Dearden's Week 1 protocol)\n- 50 wall balls for time\n- 10 burpee broad jumps for technique\n\n*Weeks 6-10:* Integration\n- Mini simulation: SkiErg 500m → 800m run → sled push 50m → 800m run → row 500m → 800m run → wall balls 50 → 800m run\n- Time everything. Track your run splits after each station.\n\n*Weeks 11-13:* Race simulation\n- Full or 75% race simulation at the Hyrox gym\n- Trial race-day nutrition (Dearden practices this in his final training block)\n\n*Week 14:* Deload — light movement, light station practice, rest.\n\n**Key adjustment:** Drop Orange Theory from 3x to 2x per week starting week 5. Redirect that day to a second Hyrox-specific session at your regular gym. OT is great general conditioning but it won't teach you sled mechanics or station pacing."}]}

My station times have improved a lot but my running has gotten slower — I used to run easy miles at 8:00 pace and now I'm struggling to hold 8:30. What's happening?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"This is a **very common pattern** in Hyrox prep, especially when athletes are adding significant station training volume on top of their existing running. Let me explain what's happening physiologically:\n\n**The likely cause: accumulated leg fatigue from concurrent training.**\n\nYour legs are now absorbing running load PLUS sled work, wall balls, lunges, squats, and station circuits. That's a massive increase in total lower-body volume compared to your pre-Hyrox training. Your aerobic engine hasn't gotten worse — your **legs are just tired.**\n\nDearden learned this the hard way during his ultramarathon days — two slipped discs from ignoring cumulative fatigue. His current rule: *\"If the numbers are down, the intensity drops.\"*\n\n**Quick diagnostic questions:**\n1. Are you sleeping 7+ hours consistently?\n2. Has your total weekly training volume increased by more than 20% from your pre-Hyrox baseline?\n3. Are your easy runs feeling hard (RPE 5-6 when they should be 3-4)?\n4. Any new aches — knees, Achilles, hip flexors?\n\nLet me know and I'll prescribe the specific fix."},{"role":"user","content":"Sleep is about 6.5 hours most nights. My total volume is definitely up — I added sled work and station practice on top of everything else without dropping anything. Easy runs feel like RPE 5-6. No major aches but my quads feel heavy all the time."},{"role":"assistant","content":"There it is. Three compounding issues:\n\n**1. Sleep debt.** Dan Churchill tracked this with his Whoop — 3 months of poor sleep visibly impacted his hormones, Zone 2 heart rate, and recovery. At 6.5 hours, you're not recovering adequately from the increased training load. Dearden's non-negotiable: sleep quality dictates training intensity.\n\n**2. Volume overreach.** You added station training WITHOUT reducing something else. That's a net increase in training stress. The body doesn't distinguish between \"running stress\" and \"sled stress\" — it's all accumulated fatigue.\n\n**3. Chronic quad loading.** Sled pushes, wall balls, squats, lunges, AND running are ALL quad-dominant. Your quads never get a full recovery day.\n\n**The fix — implement this week:**\n\n**Sleep:** Non-negotiable 7.5 hours in bed. Churchill's protocol: no food within 2 hours of sleep, no high-fat or protein-dense meals before bed. This alone will improve your recovery score.\n\n**Volume reduction:**\n- Drop your weekly running from current mileage to **25 mpw** for the next 2 weeks\n- Eliminate one station practice session per week (keep the most important one)\n- Replace one running day with a **30-min Zone 2 bike** — same aerobic stimulus, zero impact, gives quads eccentric relief\n\n**Quad recovery protocol:**\n- 48 hours between any two quad-heavy sessions (sled push, wall balls, squats, lunges)\n- Add 10 minutes of foam rolling quads and hip flexors post-session\n- One contrast shower per day (30s cold / 30s warm x 5 cycles) — promotes blood flow and recovery\n\n**Schedule restructure:**\n\n| Day | Session | Quad Load |\n|-----|---------|----------|\n| Monday | Easy run (5 miles) + upper body strength | Low |\n| Tuesday | SkiErg + rowing intervals (non-quad) | Low |\n| Wednesday | Zone 2 bike (30 min) + mobility | None |\n| Thursday | Hyrox simulation (sled + wall balls + runs) | HIGH |\n| Friday | Rest | None |\n| Saturday | Tempo run (4-5 miles) | Moderate |\n| Sunday | Long run (7-8 miles easy) | Moderate |\n\nAfter 2 weeks of this, your easy pace should return to 8:00-8:15. If it doesn't, we need to look at blood work — iron and ferritin levels specifically, which runners commonly deplete."}]}

I did a CrossFit competition last month and placed top 10. Now I want to do Hyrox Dallas in 12 weeks. My buddy who does Hyrox said I'd crush it, but I heard it's way different. What do you think?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Your buddy is right that your **fitness base will carry you** through a Hyrox race. Top-10 CrossFit competitor means you have excellent work capacity, strength, and mental toughness. But \"crush it\" is a stretch if you haven't done the specific prep.\n\nJason Khalipa — 2008 CrossFit Games Individual Champion — competed in Hyrox Dallas Pro Doubles and finished in **1:07:13**. His YouTube series was literally called *\"CrossFit Games Champion Humbled By HYROX.\"* If a Games champ gets humbled, a regional-level competitor needs to take it seriously.\n\nThe key gaps from the research on CrossFit-to-Hyrox translation:\n\n1. **Running endurance.** 8km total. How much running do you currently do per week?\n2. **Pacing.** CrossFit rewards going to the redline. Hyrox punishes it brutally.\n3. **Sled pull.** Not a CrossFit movement. Khalipa called it the biggest skill gap.\n\nTell me: what's your current weekly training look like, and what's your running fitness? Can you comfortably run 5K without stopping?"},{"role":"user","content":"I run maybe once a week — a 2-3 mile jog. I can run a 5K but it's ugly, probably around 24 minutes. My strength is great though — 285 clean, 405 deadlift, sub-3 Fran. I train 5-6 days a week at my box."},{"role":"assistant","content":"OK, real talk. Your strength is phenomenal and your CrossFit conditioning is elite. But your running is your **Achilles heel** for Hyrox. A 24-minute 5K means you're running around an 8:00/mile pace, and you only run 2-3 miles once a week. In Hyrox, you'll run 8km (5 miles) total, split into eight 1km segments — but each one comes AFTER a high-intensity station that jacks your heart rate up.\n\nRich Ryan's insight applies directly: *\"If you take a triathlete and a CrossFitter and make them do a Hyrox, the CrossFitter probably wins the first one. But if you train for Hyrox for a year, the triathlete wins the next one.\"*\n\n**Your 12-week emergency Hyrox conversion plan:**\n\n**Weeks 1-4: Build the Running Base**\n- **Add 3 runs per week** immediately:\n  - Tuesday: 3-mile easy run (Zone 2, conversational pace)\n  - Thursday: 2-mile interval session (400m hard / 400m easy x 4-6)\n  - Sunday: Long run — start at 4 miles, add 0.5 miles per week\n- **Reduce CrossFit** to 3x per week. Drop Olympic lifting volume. Keep metcons but extend duration to 25-30 minutes.\n- **Goal by week 4:** Running 15-18 miles per week comfortably\n\n**Weeks 5-8: Hyrox-Specific**\n- Maintain 3 runs per week (20-22 mpw target)\n- Replace 1 CrossFit day with **Hyrox station practice:** sled push/pull technique, SkiErg intervals (Dearden's 12 x 250m, 45s rest), 100 wall balls for time\n- Add 1 **compromised running session:** 800m run → sled push → 800m run → row 500m → 800m run → wall balls (50 reps) → 800m run\n- Your CrossFit background means stations won't be your limiter. **Running under fatigue** is what you need to train.\n\n**Weeks 9-11: Race Simulation**\n- 1 full or partial race simulation every 10 days\n- Practice pacing: all runs at 5:00-5:15/km (NOT faster), stations at RPE 7-8 (NOT 10)\n- Practice transitions and race-day nutrition\n\n**Week 12:** Deload. Light movement. Trust the work.\n\n**Your expected finish time with this prep:** Somewhere between 1:15-1:25 for your first Hyrox. The strength will carry the stations; the running improvement over 12 weeks will get you through. A sub-1:10 will require 6+ months of dedicated run training.\n\n**One critical mindset shift:** You are NOT doing a long metcon. Repeat after me: *Hyrox is an endurance event with strength elements, not a strength event with endurance elements.*"}]}

Should I start doing full race simulations every week?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"**No. Absolutely not.** Full race simulations are the most taxing sessions in your entire training plan. Doing one every week for 6 weeks would bury you in accumulated fatigue and you'd show up to race day flat.\n\nHere's what the elites do:\n\nHunter McIntyre's HAOS PRO program has **one dedicated simulation day per week** (Thursdays), but these are NOT full race simulations — they're partial simulations focusing on specific race segments with transition practice.\n\nJake Dearden only introduces **race-scenario sessions in his final training block** (6-1 weeks out), and even then, he's replicating specific scenarios, not running the full race in training.\n\n**Your 6-week countdown plan:**\n\n| Week | Simulation Approach |\n|------|--------------------|\n| **Week 6** | Half simulation: 4 stations + 4 x 1km runs. Full race weights. Time everything. |\n| **Week 5** | Full station practice at race weights but NO running between. Focus on station times only. |\n| **Week 4** | Full race simulation — this is your ONE full dress rehearsal. Race weights, race pace, practice nutrition. |\n| **Week 3** | Compromised running workout only: 4 x (station + 1km run). Lower volume, maintain intensity. |\n| **Week 2** | 50% volume simulation: 4 stations + 4 runs at race pace. Reduced effort — RPE 6-7. |\n| **Week 1** | Deload. Monday: light 20-min EMOM at 50% effort. Wednesday: 2-mile shakeout jog. Rest until race. |\n\nThat gives you **one full simulation** (week 4) and several partial simulations that stress specific race elements without crushing your recovery.\n\nDearden learned from ultrarunner Tom Evans that *\"what you do in the month prior is what most affects your race.\"* That month should be about **sharpening and recovering**, not digging deeper holes."},{"role":"user","content":"Got it. For that one full simulation in week 4 — how should I pace it? Should I try to hit my goal time or go conservative?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"**Go conservative — 5-10% slower than your goal pace.** Here's why:\n\nThe purpose of the full simulation is NOT to test your fitness. You already know where your fitness is. The purpose is to:\n\n1. **Practice race execution** — transitions, station approach, breathing reset between stations\n2. **Test nutrition strategy** — when you eat, what you eat, how your stomach handles it under effort\n3. **Identify station-specific weaknesses** — which stations spike your HR the most, which runs are your slowest\n4. **Build confidence** — finishing a full simulation at a manageable effort tells your brain \"I can do this\"\n\n**Pacing strategy for your simulation:**\n\n- **Running splits:** Aim for 5-10 seconds per km slower than your race goal. If you're targeting 5:00/km runs, hold 5:08-5:10.\n- **Station efforts:** RPE 7 — you should feel like you have 15-20% more in the tank on every station\n- **Heart rate cap:** Stay below 85% of max HR during runs, allow 88-90% during stations\n- **Transitions:** Time every transition. Walk into the station, take 3-5 breaths, then begin. Time this walk. Your goal: under 15 seconds per transition.\n\n**What to track during your simulation:**\n- Split times for every 1km run\n- Time on every station\n- Transition times\n- Heart rate at the start and end of each run and station\n- When you ate/drank and how it felt\n- RPE rating for each station (1-10)\n\nAfter the simulation, we'll analyze the data. If your 1km run splits degrade by more than 15 seconds from your first to your last, your station pacing is too aggressive. If they stay consistent, you've nailed the effort distribution.\n\nRemember Rich Ryan's wall ball wisdom for the final station: *\"Give back two minutes on the course of your effort so you can come into wall balls and gain two and a half.\"* That conservative pacing early pays dividends at the end."}]}

Hunter McIntyre eats like 5000 calories and tons of sugar. Jake Dearden is way more structured. Dan Churchill is super dialed in with meal timing. I'm confused — whose approach should I follow?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Great question — and the confusion is understandable because these three athletes have **radically different nutrition philosophies**. But they all work for a specific reason. Let me break down why:\n\n**Hunter McIntyre:** 4,500-5,500 calories, 300-500g sugar daily, zero vegetables, 2-3 steaks per day. Works because he trains 16-20 hours per week and weighs 205 lbs. His caloric expenditure justifies extreme intake. He's an outlier — do NOT copy the specifics.\n\n**Jake Dearden:** 1.7-2.2g protein per kg bodyweight, 80/20 whole foods rule, carb-focused before training, structured supplements (creatine, caffeine, electrolytes). Methodical and evidence-based.\n\n**Dan Churchill:** Master's in Exercise Science plus professional chef. Focuses on meal timing, micronutrients (\"the fifth macronutrient\"), sleep-nutrition interaction, Whoop-tracked recovery correlation. The most sophisticated approach.\n\nWhat's your current bodyweight, training volume, and eating habits? That'll help me point you to the right model."},{"role":"user","content":"I'm 180 lbs, training about 8-9 hours per week — running 35 mpw plus gym work 4 days. I eat pretty clean but don't track macros. Probably under-eating carbs if I'm being honest. I usually just have a protein bar before training."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You're under-fueling. That's exactly the mistake Dan Churchill identified in his own training — he said he *\"used to just eat a banana before training — maybe 30g of carbs — but didn't account for how much he was burning, even in Zone 2.\"*\n\nA protein bar before training is insufficient carbohydrate for the work you're doing. At 180 lbs training 8-9 hours per week, here's your nutrition framework — pulling the best from each athlete's approach:\n\n**From Dearden (structure and macros):**\n- **Protein:** 145-180g per day (1.8-2.2g/kg) — this is non-negotiable for recovery\n- **Carbs:** 350-450g per day. Yes, that's a LOT. But at your volume, your glycogen demands are high. Dearden's carb sources: bagels, porridge oats, rice, bananas\n- **The 80/20 rule:** 80% whole foods, 20% flexible. Sustainable long-term.\n\n**From Churchill (meal timing):**\n- **Pre-training (2-3 hours before):** 80-100g carbs + 20-30g protein + LOW fat. Example: 2 bagels with honey + protein shake. NOT just a protein bar.\n- **During sessions over 60 min:** 30-60g carbs per hour (gel, sports drink, banana)\n- **Post-training (within 30 min):** 30-40g protein + 50-60g carbs. Dearden always has a shake ready immediately.\n- **Pre-sleep rule:** No dense protein or high-fat meals within 2 hours of bed. Churchill found this dramatically improved his sleep quality and next-day recovery.\n\n**From Hunter (the principle, not the specifics):**\n- **Eat enough.** Most Hyrox athletes under-eat carbs. Hunter's extreme example proves the point: fuel drives performance. You don't need 5,000 calories or 500g of sugar, but you DO need adequate carbohydrate to support your training.\n\n**Supplements (from Dearden's protocol):**\n- Creatine: 5g daily — proven performance and recovery benefit\n- Electrolytes: add to training sessions, especially long runs and Hyrox simulations\n- Caffeine: restrict to before midday during training (preserves sensitivity), use strategically on race day\n\n**Total daily targets for you:**\n- Calories: 3,200-3,600\n- Protein: 145-180g\n- Carbs: 350-450g\n- Fat: 70-85g\n\n**Start tracking for 2 weeks** using MyFitnessPal or similar. I guarantee you'll find you're currently eating 250-400g carbs less than you need. That protein bar before training? Replace it with 2 bagels and honey. You'll notice the difference in your first session."}]}

I'm pretty happy but I know I left time on the table. My biggest surprise was how destroyed my legs were by station 6. Can you help me figure out what to fix for my next race?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"1:18 on your first Hyrox is a solid result — you're already well ahead of the average Pro division time of 1:22 from 2025. But you're right that there's time to claw back. Leg destruction by station 6 is a very common pattern and it's usually a **pacing and training issue, not a fitness issue.**\n\nLet me diagnose. I need some data:\n\n1. What were your approximate 1km run split times — especially comparing your first 3-4 runs versus the last 3-4?\n2. Which stations felt the hardest and how long did they take?\n3. Did you have a pacing plan going in, or did you race by feel?\n4. How was your nutrition during the race — did you eat/drink anything?"},{"role":"user","content":"My first 3 runs were around 4:15-4:20/km. By run 5-6 they were 4:45-5:00/km. The last two runs were over 5:00. The sled push crushed me — took about 90 seconds. Wall balls were rough too, about 4:30 with lots of breaks. I kind of raced by feel. Didn't eat anything during the race, just water."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Perfect — this data tells the whole story. You have a classic **positive split pattern with a nutrition-compounded fade.** Here's my analysis:\n\n**Problem 1: You went out too fast.**\nYour first runs at 4:15-4:20/km are aggressive. Those runs put you into oxygen debt early, which compounds through every station. By run 5-6, your pace had degraded by 30-40 seconds per km. Over the final 4-5 kms, you lost roughly **2-3 minutes** from pace degradation alone.\n\nThe fix from the research: start 10-15 seconds per km slower than you think you should. Rich Ryan's pacing principle: *\"Give back two minutes on the course of your effort so you can come into wall balls and gain two and a half.\"*\n\n**Target for next race:** Start your runs at 4:30-4:35/km and aim to hold that through ALL 8 runs. Even pacing across 8km will be faster overall than 4:15 fading to 5:00+.\n\n**Problem 2: Sled push technique and lactate management.**\n90 seconds is not bad for a first attempt, but there's 25-30 seconds to gain. Hunter's principle: *\"Sustained burning — push into the lactate but don't tip over.\"* Your 90 seconds suggests you may have started the sled too aggressively, stalled, then had to restart.\n\nRich Ryan's sled protocol for your next training block:\n- **Strength pillar:** Heavy sled, 3-4 x 25m, 4-6 min rest\n- **Lactate tolerance:** Race weight, 3 x 50m unbroken, 4-6 min rest\n- Train sleds 2x per week, undulating between heavy/short and race-weight/long\n\n**Problem 3: No race nutrition.**\nThis is a major issue. A 78-minute effort with zero calories means you ran out of muscle glycogen somewhere around station 5-6 — which is exactly when your legs died. Dearden carb-loads the day before and Churchill emphasizes intra-race fueling.\n\n**Race nutrition plan for next time:**\n- Night before: carb-load — 500-550g carbs, low fiber\n- Morning of: 80-100g carbs 2-3 hours before start\n- During race: 1 gel (25-30g carbs) between stations 3 and 4, and another between stations 6 and 7\n- Electrolytes in your water at every Rox Zone transition\n\n**Problem 4: Wall balls at 4:30 with lots of breaks.**\n100 wall balls in 4:30 is around 22 reps per minute with break time included. Rich Ryan's strategy: pick a sustainable set size (25 or 30) and maintain consistent rest intervals. Don't go 40 unbroken then fall apart — better to do 5 x 20 with 10-second rests.\n\n**Realistic target for your second Hyrox:** 1:08-1:12. That's 6-10 minutes of improvement from pacing discipline, sled training, nutrition timing, and wall ball efficiency alone — without any increase in actual fitness."}]}

What phases should I follow?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"With 12 weeks, you map perfectly onto Hunter McIntyre's HAOS PRO periodization framework — the same 3-phase model he uses to prepare for World Championships. Here's how I'd adapt it for your specific profile:\n\n**Phase 1: Base Building (Weeks 12-9)**\nThis is about building your Hyrox-specific work capacity while maintaining your running engine.\n\n- **Running:** Maintain 35-40 mpw. No changes needed — your aerobic base is your strength. Add one threshold run per week (3-4 miles at lactate threshold pace, ~15-20 sec/mile slower than 10K pace).\n- **Strength (2x per week):** Compound movements at 80-85% 1RM, 3-5 rep range. Focus on squat, deadlift, press. Maintenance, not progression.\n- **Hyrox Station Introduction (2x per week):** Replace 2 of your current 4 gym days with station skill work. Learn sled mechanics, SkiErg pacing, wall ball endurance. Keep these at RPE 6-7 — this is movement quality work.\n- **Deload:** Week 9 is a reduced-volume recovery week. Cut all training volume by 40%.\n\n**Phase 2: Intensity Development (Weeks 8-5)**\nNow you're applying Hunter's second principle — increase speed and position.\n\n- **Running:** Drop to 30-35 mpw. Replace one easy run with a compromised running session (station work immediately into 1km runs).\n- **Hyrox Simulation (1x per week):** Thursday becomes your simulation day — 60-75 minutes of race-specific work with transitions. This is the most important session of the week.\n- **Station Training (2x per week):** Progress to race weights on all stations. Add time trials — track your station completion times and aim for 3-5% improvement each week.\n- **Lactate Threshold Training:** One EMOM session per week combining stations at sustained effort — Hunter's *\"sustained burning\"* principle. 20-30 minute EMOMs rotating through 3-4 stations.\n- **Deload:** Week 5 is reduced volume.\n\n**Phase 3: Peak Performance (Weeks 4-1)**\n- **Week 4:** Full race simulation — your ONE dress rehearsal. Race weights, race pace, practice nutrition.\n- **Week 3:** Partial simulation — 4-5 stations with runs. Reduced volume, maintained intensity.\n- **Week 2:** 50% volume simulation. Focus on feeling sharp, not building fitness.\n- **Week 1:** Deload. Monday: light 20-min EMOM. Wednesday: 2-mile shakeout. Rest until race.\n\n**The micro-cycle within each phase:** 3 weeks of progressive loading followed by 1 week deload. This matches Hunter's pattern exactly and prevents the accumulated fatigue that causes overtraining.\n\nHunter's three principles — strength, speed, endurance — are tackled **sequentially across these phases**, not simultaneously. Phase 1 builds strength foundation, Phase 2 develops speed and lactate tolerance, Phase 3 peaks endurance and race execution. Trust the progression."}]}

Progression is undulated, not linear. One session includes sleds loaded at the FRONT of a compromised running workout. Sled work is almost entirely concentric (no eccentric loading), meaning faster recovery than squats/deadlifts.\n---"},{"role":"user","content":"I'm terrified of the sled push. It looks brutal.

Time everything. |\n\n**Key coaching cues throughout:**\n- Push: Lean at 45 degrees, arms locked on HIGH handles, short choppy steps, drive through balls of feet\n- Pull: Athletic stance, slight back lean, hand-over-hand using LATS not biceps, quick rhythm\n- Breathing: Exhale forcefully on each stride/pull, never hold breath\n\n**Why this works:** The undulating approach (heavy one day, fast the next, then lactate tolerance) prevents accommodation and trains all three energy system demands of the sled. The concentric-dominant nature of sled work means your legs recover faster than from squats or deadlifts — so this won't destroy your running."}]}

What should I do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Three weeks out is exactly where Jake Dearden's published plan shines — it's the most structured week-by-week station progression publicly available from an elite. Here's how to execute it:\n\n**Week 1: Isolated Station Volume (3 weeks out)**\n\nThe goal this week is **repeatable quality** at each station, done in isolation.\n\n- **SkiErg session:** 12 x 250m with 45 seconds rest. Dearden's cue: *\"Consistent across all 12 efforts at a tough but repeatable pace.\"* If you can't maintain pace by round 10, scale to 8 rounds.\n- **Sled Push:** 3 x 25m at race weight, 1 min rest\n- **Sled Pull:** 3 x 25m at race weight, 1 min rest\n- **Wall Balls:** 4 sets of 30 reps at race weight in 3-minute windows. In the remaining time of each window, do max-distance farmers carry at race weight. 2 min rest between sets.\n- **Running:** Maintain your normal running volume. Don't add anything.\n\n**Week 2: Station Integration (2 weeks out)**\n\nNow we combine stations with running — Dearden's transition from isolated to integrated work.\n\n- **SkiErg + Sled combo:** 3 rounds of 500m SkiErg + 20m sled push at race weight, 90 seconds rest\n- **Sled Push + Run:** 3 rounds of 25m sled push + 500m run + 25m sled push, 90 seconds rest. Track your run splits — they should stay within 10 seconds of each other.\n- **Wall Balls + Run:** 3 rounds of 50 wall balls + 500m run + 50 wall balls, 90 seconds rest. This is brutal — 300 total wall balls. Scale to 2 rounds if needed.\n- **Walking Lunges:** 3 x 50m at 1.5x race weight, 2 min rest (overloaded so race weight feels light)\n- **Running:** Reduce volume by 15-20% from normal. Quality over quantity.\n\n**Week 3: Race Simulation (race week)**\n\nDearden's race simulation protocol — each station done at race-day quantities within 5-minute windows.\n\n- **Monday or Tuesday only** (then rest until race):\n  - 1,000m SkiErg in a 5-minute window, rest remainder\n  - Full 50m sled push in a 5-minute window, rest remainder\n  - Full 50m sled pull in a 5-minute window, rest remainder\n  - 100 wall balls in a 5-minute window, rest remainder\n  - 200m farmers carry in a 5-minute window, rest remainder\n  - 100m walking lunge in a 5-minute window, rest remainder\n\n- **The rest of race week:** Light jogging (2-3 miles), mobility, sleep optimization, carb-loading the day before.\n\n**The progression logic:** Week 1 builds confidence at each station in isolation. Week 2 introduces the station-to-run coupling that Dearden considers the most race-specific training stimulus. Week 3 is a final systems check at race-day volumes without the fatigue of full integration.\n\nNotice the volume decreases while specificity increases. That's textbook tapering — reduce total training stress while maintaining the race-specific neural patterns."}]}

Week 1: 6 x 400m with 90s rest. Build to 8 x 800m by week 8. | 45 min |\n| **Thursday** | Hyrox Station Practice: Rotate through SkiErg, sled push/pull, wall balls, rowing. EMOM format, 25-30 min. | 60 min |\n| **Friday** | CrossFit-style conditioning (AMRAP/EMOM) but with Hyrox movements replacing Olympic lifts. Example: 20-min AMRAP of 250m row + 15 wall balls + 200m run | 45 min |\n\n**Running targets by week 8:** Each athlete running 20-25 km per week (up from near-zero). Add ~2km per week.\n\n**Phase 2: Hyrox-Specific (Weeks 9-14)**\n\n| Day | Session |\n|-----|---------|\n| **Monday** | Tempo run: 3-4 miles at threshold pace |\n| **Tuesday** | Hyrox Simulation (group format): Partner relay through 4-6 stations with 1km runs between. Great group energy. |\n| **Wednesday** | Interval run: 6-8 x 800m at 5K pace, 90s rest |\n| **Thursday** | Station-specific training: Sled day (Rich Ryan's 3-pillar rotation), wall ball volume day (100 for time), or erg intervals |\n| **Friday** | Extended AMRAP (40-50 min): Dearden's Sunday session format — running + stations combined. Group competition format. |\n\n**Drop CrossFit metcons to 1x per week** (Friday only, modified). Add a second running day.\n\n**Phase 3: Race Peak (Weeks 15-16)**\n- Week 15: Group race simulation — full or partial. Time everything. Create a leaderboard.\n- Week 16: Deload week. Light movement, technique practice, team bonding.\n\n**Group-specific advantages:**\n- **Partner simulations:** Pairs rotate through stations while partners run — mirrors Pro Doubles format and keeps intensity honest\n- **Group accountability on running:** The hardest part of the CrossFit-to-Hyrox switch is getting CrossFitters to run consistently. Group runs fix this.\n- **Competitive EMOM scoring:** Track total rounds/reps on Hyrox EMOMs. Post scores on a board. CrossFitters respond to competition.\n\n**Common mistakes your group will make:**\n- Going too hard on stations and walking the runs. Enforce a pacing rule: no running split more than 20 seconds slower than your fastest.\n- Skipping easy runs because they feel \"too easy.\" Zone 2 running IS the training. It builds the aerobic base that fuels everything.\n- Neglecting sled pull practice. It's the #1 skill gap for CrossFitters — Khalipa confirmed this from his own experience."}]}

Here's your day-by-day protocol pulled directly from how the elites handle race week:\n\n**Wednesday (Today) — 3 Days Out:**\n\n- **Training:** Light 20-minute EMOM at 50% effort. Touch each station briefly — 250m SkiErg, light sled push, 20 wall balls, 500m row. This is neural activation, not fitness building.\n- **Nutrition:** Normal eating, slightly elevated carbs. Target 400g carbs today. Eat meals you know sit well — no experiments.\n- **Supplements:** Creatine (5g as always), electrolytes with every meal, caffeine only before midday (Dearden's protocol — preserves sensitivity for race day).\n- **Recovery:** 15-20 minutes mobility work. Foam roll quads, hip flexors, calves. Dearden calls mobility work \"non-negotiable\" — it was a game-changer in his return from two slipped discs.\n- **Sleep:** In bed by 9:30 PM. Target 8+ hours. No screens 30 min before bed. No food within 2 hours of sleep (Dan Churchill's protocol for sleep quality).\n\n**Thursday — 2 Days Out:**\n\n- **Training:** 2-mile easy shakeout jog (Zone 1-2). That's it. Maybe 10 minutes of light stretching after.\n- **Nutrition:** Begin carb-loading. Dearden carb-loads the day before race day, but I like to start 2 days out with a moderate increase. Target 450-500g carbs. Low fiber — reduce vegetables and legumes. Increase white rice, pasta, bread, bananas, honey. Keep protein at your normal 1.8-2.0g/kg.\n- **Hydration:** Add electrolytes to all water. Sip consistently throughout the day. Urine should be light yellow, not clear (clear means you're over-diluting electrolytes).\n- **Sleep:** Same protocol. This is your most important sleep night — Saturday morning you'll have adrenaline. Thursday night is where deep recovery happens.\n\n**Friday — 1 Day Out:**\n\n- **Training:** Complete rest. A 10-minute walk is fine if you're restless. Nothing more.\n- **Nutrition:** Full carb-load day. Target 500-550g carbs. Eat familiar foods ONLY. No new restaurants, no exotic meals. \n  - Breakfast: Large bowl of oatmeal with banana and honey + toast with jam\n  - Lunch: Large bowl of white rice + chicken + bread roll\n  - Snack: Bagel with honey + banana\n  - Dinner: Large pasta dish with lean protein. Keep fat moderate. Eat by 7 PM.\n- **Prep:** Lay out all race gear. Pin your bib. Fill water bottles. Prepare your race-day nutrition (gels, electrolyte mix). Decide your pacing targets for each station and run. Write them on your forearm or a card.\n- **Mental:** Dearden worked with a sports psychologist and adopted the principle: *\"The race is going to happen no matter what, so there's no point thinking about it.\"* Enjoy the evening. Watch a movie. Don't obsess over race strategy — you've done the work.\n\n**Saturday — Race Day Morning:**\n\n- **Wake:** 3-3.5 hours before start time\n- **Breakfast (2.5-3 hours before):** 80-100g carbs + 20g protein + minimal fat. Example: 2 bagels with honey + protein shake + banana\n- **Caffeine:** Dearden goes unrestricted on race day. Take 200-300mg caffeine 45-60 minutes before start (coffee or caffeine pill)\n- **Warm-up:** 10-min easy jog + dynamic stretching + 3-4 strides at race pace\n- **During race:** Gel between stations 3-4 (25-30g carbs) + gel between stations 6-7. Electrolyte drink at every Rox Zone.\n- **Post-race:** Dearden always has a protein shake ready immediately after finishing. Have yours prepared in your bag. 30-40g protein + 50-60g carbs within 15 minutes of finishing.\n\nYou've done the training. Now execute the recovery and fueling.

I will never stop in my last 400.\" Race pacing: wall balls are last station — give back 2 min on course to come in fresh and gain 2.5.\n---"},{"role":"user","content":"I can do about 30 wall balls unbroken before I have to stop. How should I break up the 100 reps on race day? I'm worried about my shoulders dying."},{"role":"assistant","content":"30 unbroken is a solid baseline. Rich Ryan — who has the most detailed wall ball strategy in the Hyrox space — has a specific recommendation for your level:\n\nSince you can't do 50+ unbroken, his advice is to **pick a sustainable number and maintain consistent rest intervals throughout all 100 reps.** Don't go 30-then-die. Go:\n\n**Recommended break strategy for 30-unbroken capacity:**\n\n**Option A (aggressive):** 5 sets of 20 reps, 8-10 second rest between sets\n- Total time: approximately 3:30-4:00\n- Pro: Fewer transitions, steady rhythm\n- Con: Sets of 20 will feel hard after station 7\n\n**Option B (conservative, my recommendation):** 4 sets of 25 reps, 10-12 second rest between sets\n- Total time: approximately 3:30-4:00\n- Pro: Front-loads volume when you're freshest. The final set of 25 is a kick.\n- Con: First set may feel slightly harder\n\n**Option C (safety net):** 10 sets of 10 reps, 5-6 second rest between sets\n- Total time: approximately 3:45-4:15\n- Pro: Extremely manageable chunks. Shoulder fatigue is minimized.\n- Con: More total rest time\n\n**Shoulder survival tactics from Rich Ryan:**\n\n1. **Arm recovery between throws:** After releasing the ball, **drop your arms down to your sides or swing them out wide.** This promotes blood flow back to your deltoids. Do NOT hold your arms up waiting for the ball to come down.\n\n2. **Catch position:** Under your chin, not above your head. Catching high wastes shoulder endurance.\n\n3. **Breathing protocol (this is the game-changer):**\n   - **Exhale on release** (as you throw the ball up)\n   - **Inhale on catch/descent** (as you drop into the squat)\n   - This is counter-intuitive — it flips the traditional squat breathing pattern. But it allows continuous O2 exchange through the full range of motion and dramatically reduces ventilation rate spikes.\n   - **Start practicing this NOW.** It takes 2-3 weeks to override your instincts.\n\n4. **Cadence drill:** Practice dropping into your squat BEFORE the ball arrives back to your hands. Don't wait for the ball, then squat. Drop fast, catch low, drive up. This saves 0.5-1 second per rep — which is 50-100 seconds over 100 reps.\n\n**Mental framework from Ryan:** Treat every 10 reps as 100m on a running track. At rep 60: *\"I just have 40 left, which is like 400m. I will never stop in my last 400.\"* At rep 75, you're in the final 250m. That reframe turns a grind into a sprint finish.\n\n**The bigger picture:** Ryan's race pacing insight is critical — wall balls are the LAST station. *\"Give back two minutes on the course of your effort so you can come into wall balls and gain two and a half.\"* If you pace your earlier stations conservatively (RPE 7-8), you'll arrive at wall balls with enough shoulder and leg reserves to execute clean sets of 20-25."}]}

I want the highest-impact takeaway from each."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Great question — here are the two most impactful principles you can steal from each athlete:\n\n**From Hunter McIntyre: The Lactate Threshold Training Principle**\n\n*\"When you get to the point where you feel that lactate is starting to form and your muscles are starting to overload, push a little bit further and stay there. Don't push so far that performance starts to drop. Sustained burning.\"*\n\nThis is the single most important training concept for Hyrox performance. Here's why:\n\nHyrox is a **55-75 minute race at or near lactate threshold**. Every station pushes you above threshold. Every run requires you to settle back just below it. The ability to **find that edge and hold it** — without tipping into catastrophic fatigue — is the defining skill of elite Hyrox athletes.\n\n**How to apply it:** In every conditioning session, find the point where your muscles burn and your breathing is labored but controlled. Stay there. Don't back off, don't push harder. That's your training zone. This applies to sled pushes (Hunter trains at 425 lbs when race weight is 340 — he lives in that sustained burn zone), EMOMs, SkiErg intervals, and wall ball sets.\n\n**Practical implementation:** Do one 20-30 minute sustained threshold session per week. Example: 20-minute EMOM rotating through 3 Hyrox stations at race weight. The goal is NOT to go as fast as possible. The goal is to maintain consistent output where you're **uncomfortable but not declining.**\n\n---\n\n**From Jake Dearden: The Station-Run Coupling Framework**\n\n*\"I always look at the workout station and the run as one exercise.\"*\n\nThis mental model changes how you train AND how you race. Most Hyrox athletes think in segments: \"I need to be fast on the sled\" and \"I need to be fast on the runs.\" Dearden thinks: \"I need my sled push + the following 1km run to have the lowest combined time.\"\n\n**Why this matters:** Going 10 seconds faster on a sled push by sprinting it might cost you 30 seconds on the subsequent run because your legs are destroyed and your heart rate is 180. The net result is 20 seconds SLOWER. Dearden's framework forces you to optimize the **total unit**, not individual segments.\n\n**How to apply it:** In training, ALWAYS follow station work with a timed 1km run. Track the combined time (station + run), not just the station time. Your goal is to minimize the combined number.\n\n**Practical implementation:** Once per week, do this coupling workout:\n- Station A + 1km run → record combined time\n- Station B + 1km run → record combined time\n- Station C + 1km run → record combined time\n\nOver weeks, you'll learn exactly how hard you can push each station before your run time degrades. That data becomes your **race pacing strategy.**\n\n---\n\n**Together, these two principles create the complete Hyrox athlete:** Hunter's lactate threshold training builds the engine to sustain hard effort. Dearden's coupling framework teaches you how to **deploy that engine intelligently** across 8 stations and 8 runs."}]}
