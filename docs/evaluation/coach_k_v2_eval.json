      "response": "Great question \u2014 this is where most first-timers go wrong. Let me lay it out clearly:\n\n**Hyrox Open Division (most popular):**\n- **Weight stack:** 152 kg (men), 102 kg (women)\n- **Sled Push:** 152 kg (incl. sled)\n- **Sled Pull:** 103 kg (incl. sled)\n- **Farmers Carry:** 2 x 24 kg (men), 2 x 16 kg (women)\n- **Sandbag Lunges:** 20 kg (men), 10 kg (women)\n- **Wall Balls:** 6 kg to 3m target (men), 4 kg to 2.7m target (women)\n- **Burpee Broad Jumps:** Bodyweight only\n- **Who it's for:** 90%+ of Hyrox athletes. This is the standard division.\n\n**Hyrox Pro Division:**\n- **Weight stack:** 202 kg (men), 152 kg (women)\n- **Sled Push:** 202 kg (incl. sled)\n- **Sled Pull:** 153 kg (incl. sled)\n- **Farmers Carry:** 2 x 32 kg (men), 2 x 24 kg (women)\n- **Sandbag Lunges:** 30 kg (men), 20 kg (women)\n- **Wall Balls:** 9 kg to 3m target (men), 6 kg to 2.7m target (women)\n- **Burpee Broad Jumps:** Bodyweight only (same as Open)\n- **Who it's for:** Elite athletes with Hyrox experience and strong functional fitness backgrounds \u2014 think competitive CrossFit athletes, high-level strength and conditioning competitors, or athletes who have already posted competitive Open times (sub-1:10 for men, sub-1:20 for women).\n\n**Hyrox Doubles Division:**\n- Same station weights as Open Division (152 kg weight stack, etc.)\n- **Format:** You and your partner alternate stations \u2014 Partner A does Station 1, Partner B does Station 2, and so on. **Both partners run ALL 8 x 1km runs together.**\n- **Who it's for:** First-timers who want a lower-pressure introduction, experienced athletes who want a different challenge, or pairs with complementary skill sets (e.g., one strong runner + one strong lifter).\n\n**My recommendation for 99% of readers:** Sign up for the **Open Division**. Here's why:\n\n1. **It's the standard.** Most athletes compete Open, so your times are comparable across the field.\n2. **The weights are challenging but achievable.** A 152 kg sled push is hard but doable for most trained men. The jump to 202 kg in Pro is massive \u2014 you need serious strength-endurance.\n3. **The Pro division has NO scaling.** If you can't handle 202 kg on the sled, you're walking it (which takes FOREVER).\n4. **Doubles is a different beast.** It's not easier \u2014 the runs are the same, and each partner does 4 stations at full weight. It's just different.\n\n**When to choose Pro:** You've done multiple Hyrox races, your Open times are competitive (sub-1:10 men / sub-1:20 women), and you're looking for the next challenge. Not before.\n\n**When to choose Doubles:** You're doing your first Hyrox and want a partner, or you're coming back from injury and want a lighter station load.",

For women, it's **84:50**. This is what \"average\" actually looks like.\n- The gap between elite and average is massive \u2014 over 20 minutes for both men and women. This isn't a linear progression; each level requires significantly more fitness than the one below it.\n- Even the bottom 10% of finishers still finish. Hyrox has a **99.6% completion rate**. Almost nobody DNFs.\n\n**For your first Hyrox as a recreational athlete:**\nAim for the **intermediate range** \u2014 75-90 minutes for men, 85-100 minutes for women. That's a realistic and respectable first race. Your runs will likely average 5:00-5:45/km with stations adding the rest.\n\n**First-timer targets:**\n- Running: Finish all 8 km, even if you walk parts of Runs 3-4\n- Wall Balls: Break them into sets of 20-25, use the minimum rest needed\n- Sled Push: Don't stop until you finish (even if it takes 5+ min)\n- Burpees: Steady tempo, don't rush\n- Goal: Finish strong, learn the format, get your time for next time\n\n**The most important benchmark:** Your second race compared to your first. Most athletes drop **10-20%** from their first to second race just from experience and pacing knowledge. That improvement is worth more than any absolute number.",

Then you build progressively. Going out at 1:50/500m for the first 300m and dying at 600m is far worse than starting at 2:05 and finishing at 1:50.\n\n**Target total time:** For a 1:30-1:40 finish, aim for ~4:30-4:50 on the SkiErg. That's roughly 2:05-2:10 average split.\n\n**Stroke rate:** 30-35 SPM throughout. Don't drop below 28, don't spike above 38. Consistency is everything on the SkiErg.\n\n**What to focus on during each segment:**\n- **0-300m:** Lat engagement, hip hinge depth, breathing rhythm (exhale on pull, inhale on recovery). Settle in.\n- **300-600m:** Build cadence slightly, maintain or improve split. Check the monitor \u2014 are you averaging 2:05 or better?\n- **600-750m:** Push slightly harder. Increase stroke rate by 5 SPM. This is where the race pace feels normal.\n- **750-1000m:** Empty the tank. Shorten the recovery slightly, drive harder with each stroke. You're almost done.\n\n**Post-SkiErg:** Walk the first 10-15 seconds of the Roxzone. Shake out your arms. Don't try to run right away \u2014 your lats and arms will be burning.

      "response": "Sled push is where races are won or lost on the margin. Here's the complete technique breakdown.\n\n**Body Position (The Setup):**\n- **Angle:** 45 degrees or lower. The closer to horizontal your torso, the more horizontal force you apply. Think \"wheelbarrow position.\"\n- **Hips:** Below shoulder height. This is critical \u2014 it creates the forward lean that transfers leg power into horizontal force.\n- **Head:** Neutral to slightly down. Looking forward causes your hips to rise and your angle to open up.\n- **Arms:** Extended but not locked. Elbows at 160-170 degrees. Arms are connectors, not pushers.\n\n**Hand Placement:**\n- **High on the sled:** Upper third of the sled face. This gives you better leverage and makes it easier to maintain the low body angle.\n- **Shoulder-width apart or slightly wider.** Wider base = more stable = more force transfer.\n\n**Stride Pattern:**\n- **Short, explosive steps.** 6-8 inches in length, 120+ steps per minute. NOT long driving strides \u2014 those create a stop-start pattern and waste energy on deceleration.\n- **45-degree angle at foot strike.** Your feet should be hitting the ground at the same angle your body is at. This is why your torso leans forward \u2014 to align your leg drive with the direction of sled travel.\n- **Full foot contact.** Heel and toe strike the ground simultaneously. No tiptoe running.\n\n**Breathing:**\n- **Exhale with each push step.** Every time your foot strikes the ground and you drive, exhale sharply. Inhale between steps \u2014 the brief moment your foot is in the air. This keeps your core braced under load.\n\n**The Drive Phase:**\n- **Legs do 90%+ of the work.** Arms are rigid connectors transmitting leg force to the sled. Do NOT try to \"bench press\" the sled forward \u2014 this is the most common technique mistake and it's incredibly energy-inefficient.\n- **Imagine the sled as a wall.** You're driving into it with your legs, maintaining constant forward pressure. The goal is continuous sled movement, not max-force bursts.\n\n**Turn Technique:**\n- **Touch-and-go at turns.** Never let the sled fully stop. Lose momentum = exponentially harder to restart.\n- **Use your body weight to pivot.** Lean into the turn and let your body momentum shift the sled direction.\n\n**Pacing:**\n- **50m at 90% effort, 50m at 90% effort.** Do NOT go 100% on the first 50m and die on the second. Consistent pressure beats heroic starts every time.\n\n**Why this technique matters in numbers:**\nA 2025 Hyrox training study found athletes using proper body angle (45 degrees or lower) moved the sled 2.4x faster than those standing too upright. That's the difference between a 2:30 sled push and a 6:00 sled push \u2014 3:30 on one station from technique alone.\n\nDrill this in training at 50% and 100% race weight before race day.",

      "response": "Let me give you the exact technique because this station has the highest time variance of any station in Hyrox \u2014 the difference between a good technique and a bad technique is 60-90 seconds.\n\n**The Pulling Motion:**\nYou want **rapid, choppy hand-over-hand pulls** with your arms nearly fully extended. Think \"reeling in a fish\" fast. Each pull should move about 12-18 inches of rope. Short, fast pulls keep the sled moving \u2014 long sweeping arm motions create a stop-start pattern that's dramatically less efficient.\n\n**The Anchor Position:**\n\nStand facing the sled with your feet **shoulder-width apart**, toes gripping the edge of the mat. Your base of support is everything on this station. Here's the critical detail: **position your feet so the rope is at a 45-degree angle** when it reaches you. This means you'll be standing **2-3 feet back from the edge of the mat.**\n\n**Why 45 degrees matters:** If the rope is too vertical (you're too close to the sled), you're pulling the sled into a wall \u2014 you're fighting friction directly head-on. If the rope is too horizontal (you're too far back), you're pulling the sled sideways and fighting the mat friction at its worst. 45 degrees is the sweet spot.\n\n**The Power Transfer:**\nYour arms are merely transmitting force generated by your **legs and core.** Your legs anchor against the mat and your core transfers the pull from your arms down through your trunk. If your arms are doing all the work, you'll burn out by the 3rd pull.\n\n**Setup checklist:**\n- Feet shoulder-width, toes gripping the mat edge\n- Standing 2-3 feet back from the edge (45-degree rope angle)\n- Slight back lean for better ground contact\n- Short, rapid hand-over-hand pulls with nearly straight arms\n- Drive through your legs \u2014 don't just arm-pull",

      "response": "Burpee broad jumps are one of the biggest separators in Hyrox \u2014 elite men average **2:42**, competitive men average **5:22**, and recreational men average **8:27**. The difference is almost entirely technique, not fitness.\n\n**The Problem Most People Have:**\nYou're probably treating each rep as a separate movement \u2014 jump forward, land, reset, then do the next one. That's slow and energetically expensive. Instead, think of it as a continuous locomotion pattern where you never really stop.\n\n**High-Efficiency Technique:**\n\n**1. The Jump:**\n- **How far to jump:** Target **60-65% of your max broad jump distance**. If you can broad jump 2.5m fresh, aim for ~1.5m per rep. Jumping at 80%+ max distance is too aggressive \u2014 you'll gass out by rep 15.\n- **Jump direction:** Forward and slightly angled, not straight forward. This creates a diagonal path that lets you cover the 80m in roughly 55-60 reps instead of 80. Over 80m, that saves 25-30 reps.\n- **Arm swing on the jump:** Powerful forward swing to generate momentum. Your arms contribute ~10-15% of your jump distance \u2014 don't neglect them.\n\n**2. The Landing:**\n- **Land soft** with bent knees. A stiff-legged landing is jarring and costs energy over 55+ reps.\n- Use the landing momentum to initiate the next rep \u2014 don't absorb and then restart.\n\n**3. The Burpee Portion:**\n- **Keep your hands close to your feet.** The closer your hands are to your feet, the shorter the ground-to-standing distance and the less energy each rep costs.\n- **Step back, not jump back.** Stepping back for the ground portion is allowed and saves significant energy compared to jumping back.\n- **Lower to the ground** but don't linger. Touch and go \u2014 the pause at the bottom costs more time than you think over 55 reps.\n\n**Pacing Targets:**\n- **Elite:** 40-45 reps to cover 80m (~1.8-2.0m per rep), under 3 minutes\n- **Competitive:** 55-65 reps (~1.2-1.5m per rep), 4-6 minutes\n- **Recreational:** 70-80+ reps (~1.0-1.2m per rep), 7-9+ minutes\n\n**Training Protocol:**\n- **Week 1-2:** 5 sets of 10 reps at 50% race distance jumps (0.75-1.0m per rep). Focus on continuous rhythm \u2014 never stop between reps.\n- **Week 3-4:** 5 sets of 15 reps at 65% race distance. Practice the arm swing.\n- **Week 5-6:** 4 sets of 20 reps at 80% race distance. Add the diagonal jumping angle.\n- **Week 7-8:** 2 sets of 40 reps at race distance. Time both sets \u2014 variance >30 seconds = pacing problem.\n\n**Recovery:** Burpee broad jumps are extremely demanding. Keep them to 1-2 sessions per week maximum. Other sessions use regular burpees for conditioning.",

Let me fix your approach.\n\n**The problem I hear:** You're max-contracting your grip muscles for the entire 200m. That's like doing a 200m sprint at 95% effort \u2014 you blow up early. Grip is a small muscle group with limited endurance.\n\n**The fix \u2014 my 3-phase carry strategy:**\n\n**Phase 1: 0-70m \u2014 Loose hook grip (70-80% max squeeze)**\nFingers draped over the handle, thumb on top. Your forearms should feel relaxed \u2014 you should be able to wiggle your fingers. This is your \"cruise\" phase. You're not racing this section.\n\n**Phase 2: 70-170m \u2014 Moderate grip (85-90% max squeeze)**\nGrip tightens slightly. Forearms start working but aren't screaming. This is your \"sustain\" phase. Your breathing should be rhythmic \u2014 inhale for 3-4 steps, exhale for 3-4 steps.\n\n**Phase 3: 170-200m \u2014 Maximum grip (95-100% max squeeze)**\nThis is where you go all-out. Your grip is freshest at the end because you conserved it. Sprint the last 30m.\n\n**Additional grip savers:**\n- **Keep the handles close to your body** \u2014 elbow at 90 degrees or less. This shortens the lever arm and reduces grip demand by 20-30%.\n- **Walk fast, don't run.** Running increases handle bounce and grip demand. A brisk walk at 0:55-1:05/km pace is the sweet spot.\n- **Don't look down.** Look 6+ meters ahead. When you look down, your shoulders round forward and the kettlebells drift away from your body, increasing grip demand.\n\n**Training protocol:** 4 x 50m farmer carry at race weight, 90 sec rest. Focus on maintaining a consistent grip pressure from meter 1 to meter 50. No death grip on set 1. Build to unbroken 200m over 4-6 weeks.\n\n**Bonus tip:** Chalk your hands before you pick up the kettlebells. Sweaty palms cause your forearms to work harder to maintain grip. Chalk eliminates that variable.",

      "response": "This is the most common limiter on Station 7 and it cascades into Run 8 performance. Your quads are the primary driver of both the lunge and the subsequent run. Let me give you the specific training protocol.\n\n**Why your quads are failing:**\n\nThe sandbag lunges require approximately **100-120 steps** of walking lunges with a 20kg sandbag. Each step is a deep quad-dominant movement (similar to a front squat in single-leg format). By step 70-80, your quads are flooded with metabolic byproducts \u2014 hydrogen ions, lactate, inorganic phosphate \u2014 all of which reduce force production.\n\nThe run after lunges is notoriously the slowest 1km of the race. Athletes lose **30-90 seconds** per km compared to their fresh pace. The Brandt et al. (2025) study showed Run 8 had the largest pace degradation of any segment.\n\n**Training Protocol \u2014 Quad Resilience for Lunges:**\n\n**Session 1: Lunge Volume (1x/week)**\n- 4 x 25 walking lunges with 20kg sandbag\n- Rest: 2 minutes between sets\n- Total: 100 lunges per session\n- Progression: Add 25 lunges per week until you reach 100 unbroken\n- Key: Touch-and-go rhythm. Rear knee touches ground, immediately drive up. No pausing in standing position.\n\n**Session 2: Quad Endurance (1x/week)**\n- Front squats: 4 x 10 at 60% 1RM, 90s rest\n- Goblet squats: 3 x 15 at 30kg, 60s rest\n- Wall sits: 3 x 60 seconds, 30s rest\n- Sled push: 4 x 50m at race weight (quad-dominant) if available\n\n**Session 3: Compromised Running (1x/week)**\n- 100m lunges at race weight \u2192 immediately 800m run at target pace\n- Repeat 2-3 times\n- This teaches your body to flush lactate while running \u2014 the exact skill needed for Run 8\n\n**Race-Day Strategy:**\n1. **Step length:** 0.9-1.0m per step. Longer steps shift load to glutes/hamstrings and reduce quad demand.\n2. **Tempo:** Continuous touch-and-go. Never stand still between reps.\n3. **Posture:** Chest up, shoulders retracted. Sandbag HIGH on traps.\n4. **Run 8 pacing:** Accept you'll be 30-45 seconds slower than your fresh pace. Don't fight it. Let your quads flush lactate while moving.\n\n**Supplementary work:** Bulgarian split squats (3 x 12 per leg, RPE 7) and single-leg RDLs (3 x 10 per leg) build the unilateral leg strength that lunges demand.",

      "response": "Failing around rep 60 means your break point is clearly defined. Here's the strategy based on your specific pattern.\n\n**First, a critical rule:** The wall ball break strategy should be **planned, not reactive.** If you plan to go unbroken and fail, you've wasted energy on the failed attempt. If you plan breaks, you can maintain consistent rest intervals and a consistent pace per rep.\n\n**Your optimal strategy based on failing at 60:**\n\nGiven your failure point at 60, here's what I'd prescribe:\n\n**Option A: Aggressive with 2 planned breaks**\n- Reps 1-30: Continuous \u2014 you know you can do this\n- Break 1: 8-10 seconds (set ball down, breathe, shake arms)\n- Reps 31-60: Continuous \u2014 push through this segment knowing the next break is coming\n- Break 2: 8-10 seconds\n- Reps 61-100: Continuous to finish\n\n**Option B: Conservative with 3 planned breaks**\n- Reps 1-25: Continuous\n- Break 1: 5-8 seconds\n- Reps 26-50: Continuous\n- Break 2: 5-8 seconds\n- Reps 51-75: Continuous\n- Break 3: 5-8 seconds\n- Reps 76-100: Continuous\n\n**Which one should you choose?**\n\nIf you've been doing full Hyrox race simulations, **Option A (2 breaks)** is the better choice. It preserves your natural rhythm in two longer segments (30 and 30 reps) with a single break in the middle. The 8-10 second breaks are just long enough to reset your shoulders and breathing.\n\nIf this is your first or second Hyrox and you're less experienced under race fatigue, **Option B (3 breaks)** is safer. The 25-rep segments are short enough that you never approach failure \u2014 keeping each segment fast and controlled.\n\n**Target rep tempo for both options:**\n- Time per rep: **3.0-3.5 seconds** (including catch and squat)\n- Rest intervals: **strictly timed** \u2014 set a watch or count breaths\n\n**The math on break strategy:**\n\nLet's say each rep takes 3.25 seconds.\n\n| Strategy | Total Rep Time | Total Rest | Total Time |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Unbroken (if you could) | 325 sec | 0 sec | 325 sec |\n| Option A (2 breaks) | 325 sec | ~18 sec | **343 sec** |\n| Option B (3 breaks) | 325 sec | ~15-24 sec | **340-349 sec** |\n\n**The key insight:** Option B (3 breaks) actually totals only 15-24 seconds more rest than Option A \u2014 but it keeps you farther from failure. And going unbroken isn't an option for you at your current fitness level.\n\n**Training protocol to push your unbroken capacity beyond 60:**\n\n- **Week 1-2:** 5 sets of 20 reps, 60 sec rest between sets. Focus on consistent tempo.\n- **Week 3-4:** 3 sets of 30 reps, 60 sec rest. Then progress to 2 sets of 35.\n- **Week 5-6:** 2 sets of 40, then attempt 50 unbroken.\n- **Week 7-8:** Race simulation \u2014 100 reps after a 1km run and 50m sled pull.\n\n**Race-day tip:** After the BBJ station, your shoulders are already fatigued. Take 2-3 deep breaths before starting wall balls. Set your first rep tempo and lock into it \u2014 do NOT go faster than your planned pace on reps 1-20. The first 20 reps are where races are won, not the last 20.",

Zero training. Pack your race bag, write pacing targets on your arm, prep nutrition.\n\n**Day -1 (day before):**\nLight 15-20 minute shakeout jog + 2 x 30-sec strides. Nothing more.\n\n**Race Day:**\nYou'll feel restless, anxious, and probably a little sluggish from the reduced training. That's normal and exactly what we want \u2014 your body is storing glycogen, repairing muscle, and sharpening neural pathways. Trust the taper.\n\n**What NOT to do during the taper:**\n- Don't try a new workout or exercise. Everything should be familiar.\n- Don't add volume because you feel good. The taper IS the training.\n- Don't change your diet drastically (minor carb-loading is fine, but no radical shifts)\n- Don't stay up late watching race videos or browsing forums. Sleep is the number one performance enhancer in these 10 days.\n\n**Race Primer Session (Day -3):**\nThis is the most important session of the taper. 15-20 minutes total.\n\n| Segment | Purpose |\n|---|---|\n| 3 min easy jog | Warm-up |\n| 4 x 400m at race pace (1:45-1:55/km) with 200m jog rest | Neurological priming \u2014 your body needs to remember race pace |\n| 2 x 50m sled push at race weight | Tactile familiarity with the sled |\n| 1 x 15m burpee broad jump at race cadence | Neural priming for the most systemically fatiguing station |\n| 2 min easy jog | Cool-down |\n\nThat's it.

Here's my educated guess on where your time broke down:\n\n| Component | Your Time (~82 min) | Target (~70 min) | Time to Find |\n|-----------|--------------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| Running (8 km) | ~42:00 (5:15/km avg) | ~36:00 (4:30/km avg) | **6:00** |\n| Stations (total) | ~36:00 | ~30:00 | **6:00** |\n| Roxzone | ~4:00 | ~4:00 | **0:00** |\n\n**Six minutes from running, six minutes from stations. Here's the plan:**\n\n**Running Improvement (save 6 minutes):**\nYou need to drop from 5:15/km to 4:30/km \u2014 over a minute per km. That's significant but achievable with structured training. The fix:\n- **VO2max intervals:** 1x/week, Norwegian 4x4: 4 min at 90-95% HRmax, 3 min jog, 4 rounds. This drives your aerobic ceiling up.\n- **Tempo runs:** 1x/week, 20-30 min at 4:30-4:45/km pace. This teaches your body what target pace feels like.\n- **Add speed work:** 1x/week, 6x800m at 4:15/km pace with 90s rest. This develops the leg turnover you need at faster paces.\n- **Total running volume:** If you're currently running 25-30 km/week, bump to 35-40 km/week. The additional volume alone will improve your aerobic base.\n\n**Station Improvement (save 6 minutes):**\nAt 36 minutes of total station time, you're probably losing time across multiple stations rather than one weak link. The fix:\n- **Sled push technique:** Most people lose 30-60 seconds here from poor body angle alone. Film yourself \u2014 are you standing too upright? Get to 45 degrees.\n- **Sled pull pacing:** If you're going all-out on pulls and then resting, switch to steady pulls with no dead time.\n- **Wall balls:** Break strategy \u2014 instead of 25-25-25-25 with long rests, try 20-20-20-20-20 with 3-breath breaks. The shorter rests save 60-90 seconds.\n- **Burpee broad jumps:** Increase jump distance (aim for 1.5-1.7m per rep) and maintain a steady tempo.\n- **Farmers carry:** If you dropped the kettlebells, work on grip endurance (dead hangs, towel pull-ups).\n- **Rowing:** If you went all-out, try pacing at 2:05-2:15/500m instead.\n\n**The big lever most people miss \u2014 transition training:**\nIn your first race, you probably walked into each station, caught your breath, then started. Eliminate that. Practice \"compromised running\" \u2014 jogging at a slow pace into each station, then immediately starting the movement. This alone can save 60-90 seconds across 8 transitions.\n\n**Weekly training structure (16 weeks to race):**\n- Running: 4-5 sessions (intervals, tempo, easy, long, speed)\n- Stations: 2 sessions (technique focus + race simulation)\n- Strength: 2 sessions (maintenance \u2014 you don't need to get stronger, you need to get more efficient)\n\n**Nutrition for the leap:**\nAt sub-70, you're entering a different metabolic zone. You need to train your body to use carbohydrate fuel efficiently:\n- Increase carb intake to 6-8 g/kg on training days (up from whatever you're currently eating)\n- Practice intra-race fueling: take a gel during Run 3 and Run 6\n- If you didn't carb-load before your first race, do it this time \u2014 increase carbs to 8-10 g/kg for 2-3 days pre-race\n\n82 to 70 in one training cycle is ambitious but doable if you're specific about where the time is hiding and target those areas directly.",

      "response": "You have the single most valuable asset in Hyrox \u2014 aerobic capacity. A 3:15 marathon tells me your VO2max is likely 55-60+ mL/kg/min. The average male Hyrox finisher runs a 4:30/km average \u2014 you're probably looking at 4:00-4:15/km runs. That's a huge advantage.\n\n**The problem:** Your stations are weak, which means the transitions are killing you. If your runs are 4:00/km but your Roxzone time is 8+ minutes, you're bleeding time where no one sees it. And the stations themselves are probably taking 5-6 minutes each instead of the 3-4 minutes they should.\n\n**Your 16-week plan structure:**\n\n**Keep your running fitness (2 sessions/week):**\n- **Long run:** 60-70 min easy (Zone 2). Non-negotiable. This protects your aerobic base.\n- **Tempo run:** 25-35 min at 4:00-4:30/km pace. This keeps your race-pace running sharp.\n\n**Build station strength (3 sessions/week):**\n- **Session 1:** Sled push + sled pull. Start at 80% race weight. 6 x 50m push, 6 x 50m pull. Rest 2 min between reps. Progress to race weight by Week 8.\n- **Session 2:** Wall balls + burpee broad jumps. 5 x 20 wall balls (race weight, race target), 5 x 20m burpee broad jumps. Rest 3 min between sets.\n- **Session 3:** SkiErg + rowing intervals. 8 x 250m SkiErg, 8 x 250m row. Moderate pace, focus on technique.\n\n**Add 1 full simulation every 4 weeks.** This is where you practice transitions \u2014 running 1km, doing a station, running 1km, doing a station. Track your Roxzone time.\n\n**Weekly hours:** 6-8 hours total. Down from whatever 16-week marathon training was (probably 12-15+ hours). The reduced volume gives your body the capacity to absorb station training.\n\n**Nutrition shift:** You probably eat like a runner (high carbs, low protein). Shift to 2.0-2.2 g/kg protein daily. You're now doing significant strength work and need the recovery fuel.\n\n**Realistic target:** With your running base and 16 weeks of dedicated station work, a 1:35-1:50 Hyrox finish is realistic. That would place you in the top 20-30% of all finishers, and in the top 10-15% of first-timers.",

The runs are NOT all created equal \u2014 and racing them equally is a recipe for blowing up.\n\n**Here's the data:** Brandt et al. (2025) found that Run 5 (after BBJ) was the slowest of all 8 runs at 5:35/km in recreational athletes, while Run 2 (after SkiErg) was the fastest at 4:54/km. That's an 81-second gap between the fastest and slowest run. Elite athletes also showed significant pacing variation.\n\n**Why you can't run them all the same:**\n\nAfter SkiErg (Run 2), you're relatively fresh \u2014 it's an upper-body station. Your legs are fine. After BBJ (Run 5), you've just done 80m of maximal-effort broad jumps. Your quads are on fire, your HR is spiked, and your running economy is destroyed.\n\n**My pacing strategy:**\n\n**Run 1 (after SkiErg):** Target pace \u2014 **4:30-4:45/km** (conservative start)\nYou're fresh. Resist the urge to sprint. Set a metronome-like rhythm. This is the run where most first-timers make their biggest mistake by going too fast.\n\n**Run 2 (after Sled Push):** Target pace \u2014 **4:30-4:45/km** (maintain)\nYour legs will feel heavy from the sled push, but you're still in the first half. Hold your pace. Don't accelerate \u2014 you're not racing the guy next to you.\n\n**Run 3 (after Sled Pull):** Target pace \u2014 **4:30-4:45/km** (hold steady)\nUpper body station, legs are fine. Keep the rhythm.\n\n**Run 4 (after BBJ):** Target pace \u2014 **4:45-5:00/km** (allow 15-30 sec slower)\nThis is where discipline matters. Your quads are burning from 80m of broad jumps. Your brain will say \"slow down.\" Your job is to find a sustainable rhythm, not to walk.\n\n**Run 5 (after Rowing):** Target pace \u2014 **4:45-5:00/km** (allow slightly slower)\nSeated station \u2014 your legs got a break. But you're at the halfway mark and fatigue is accumulating. Don't push.\n\n**Run 6 (after Farmer's Carry):** Target pace \u2014 **4:45-5:15/km** (accept some slowdown)\n120m of loaded carries with 2x24kg. Your grip is fried, your traps are tight, your legs are heavy. Just run. Don't walk.\n\n**Run 7 (after Lunges):** Target pace \u2014 **5:00-5:30/km** (slowest run \u2014 this is fine)\n100m of walking lunges. Your quads are destroyed. This is the run where recreational athletes often walk. Don't walk. Keep running, even at 6:00/km. Walking turns a 30-second recovery into a 2-minute recovery.\n\n**Run 8 (after Wall Balls):** Target pace \u2014 **4:45-5:15/km** (allow some slowdown)\nYou're done with stations. Empty the tank on this run. Sprint the final 200m if you have anything left.\n\n**The golden rule:** Your first 3 runs should be within 15 seconds of each other.

      "response": "Compromised running is the **single most Hyrox-specific skill** you can develop, and almost nobody trains it properly. Let me define it, explain why it's different from regular running, and give you the exact workout formats.\n\n**What compromised running IS:**\nIt's running immediately after completing a station that has fatigued specific muscle groups. Your legs are full of lactate, your heart rate is elevated, and your running mechanics are altered. The first 200-400m of a post-station run feels completely different from a fresh run.\n\n**What compromised running IS NOT:**\n- It's NOT running on tired legs after a long run. That's just fatigue.\n- It's NOT running slowly because you're not trying. That's just jogging.\n- It's NOT a metabolic conditioning workout with running in it. That's CrossFit.\n\n**Why it's Hyrox-specific:**\nIn a Hyrox race, you run 8 km but **NONE of it is on fresh legs**. Run 1 is after a warm-up (closest to fresh), but Runs 2-8 are all compromised. You've just done sled push, your quads are burning, your breathing is elevated \u2014 now run 1km. That's what compromised running trains.\n\n**How to train compromised running:**\n\n**Workout 1: Station-to-Run Intervals (1x/week)**\n- 4 rounds of:\n  - Sled push 50m at race weight\n  - Immediately run 800m at race pace\n  - Rest 3 minutes\n- Track each 800m split. Variance >15 sec between rounds = compromised running fitness is the bottleneck\n\n**Workout 2: Hyrox Block Simulation (1x/fortnight)**\n- 4 stations with 1km runs between each:\n  - Station A \u2192 Run 1km \u2192 Station B \u2192 Run 1km \u2192 Station C \u2192 Run 1km \u2192 Station D\n  - All at race weights and race paces\n- Focus on the first 200m of each run \u2014 that's where the compromised running happens. If your first 200m is 30+ sec/km slower than your average, you need more compromised running practice\n\n**Workout 3: Progressive Run After Erg (1x/week)**\n- 3 rounds of:\n  - Row 500m at threshold pace\n  - Immediately run 400m, 600m, 800m (progressive distance)\n  - Rest 4 minutes between rounds\n- The row fatigues your legs and elevates heart rate. The run teaches your body to find a rhythm on tired legs\n\n**The pacing rule for compromised running:**\n- First 200m: Accept 15-20 sec/km slower than goal pace. Don't fight it. Let heart rate settle from the station.\n- 200-400m: Build to 90% of goal pace\n- 400m+: Race pace\n- Total: First 400m may be 20-30 sec slower than your average, but the final 600m should be on pace\n\n**Technique cues on compromised runs:**\n- **Shorten stride length** (by 10-15 cm) \u2014 your legs don't have the power for long strides\n- **Increase cadence** (by 5-10 SPM) \u2014 short, quick steps\n- **Breathe every 2 steps** \u2014 don't try to find a 3-3 or 4-4 breathing pattern when your heart rate is 90%+ max\n- **Don't try to \"shake out\" your legs** in the first 100m \u2014 just start running and let your body settle\n\n**Progression over 16 weeks:**\n- Weeks 1-4: 3 rounds of station-to-run intervals\n- Weeks 5-8: 4 rounds, increase run distance to 1km\n- Weeks 9-12: 5 rounds, add a second station before each run\n- Weeks 13-16: Full race simulations with compromised runs between every station\n\nIf you're not doing at least one compromised running session per week, you're not training Hyrox \u2014 you're training fitness.

But when you're in a caloric deficit, your body may use amino acids for fuel instead of building muscle. The research (Garthe et al., 2011; Churchward-Venne et al., 2016) shows that with adequate protein intake, you can **minimally preserve** muscle mass while in a deficit.\n\n**The Protocol for Your 15-lb Loss**\n\n**Phase 1 \u2014 Base Building (Weeks 1-4): NO caloric deficit.**\nFocus on building training consistency.

Let training adaptations develop without the stress of a deficit.\n\n**Phase 2 \u2014 Moderate Deficit (Weeks 5-10):**\n- **Deficit:** 200-300 kcal/day (NOT 500-1000)\n- **Total:** ~3,300-3,500 kcal\n- **Protein:** 200g (non-negotiable \u2014 this is your insurance policy against muscle loss)\n- **Carbs:** 350-450g on training days, 200-250g on rest days\n- **Fat:** 90-110g\n- **Weekly weight loss:** 0.5-1.0 lb/week (this is sustainable)\n- **Expected total loss in this phase:** ~6-8 lbs\n\n**Phase 3 \u2014 Race Peak (Weeks 11-14):**\n- Stop the deficit entirely. Return to maintenance or slight surplus.\n- Body recomp focus: keep protein high (200g), moderate carbs (400-500g), moderate fat (100-120g).\n- Any weight lost in phases 1-2 will be leaner mass, which improves power-to-weight ratio.\n\n**Phase 4 \u2014 Taper (Weeks 15-16):**\n- Full maintenance. Carbo-load the last 3 days before race.\n- You should be approximately 8-12 lbs lighter than when you started, with better body composition.\n\n**The math:** ~1 lb/week for 12-14 weeks = 12-14 lbs, plus 1-2 lbs from phase 4 rehydration = 13-16 lbs total. You hit your 15-lb target.\n\n**Non-negotiable rules:**\n- **Never cut calories before a key training session.** Eat normally on days with simulation runs, HIIT, or strength.\n- **Keep carbs above 250g on training days.** Going below this impairs glycogen repletion and reduces training quality.\n- **Track weight weekly, not daily.** Daily fluctuations are noise (water weight, glycogen, bowel movements). Weigh yourself once per week on the same day, same time, same conditions.\n- **If weight loss stalls for 2+ weeks AND you're tracking your food:** Increase deficit by 100 kcal, not 500. Small adjustments.\n- **If training quality declines noticeably** (RPE significantly higher than expected, pace drops, sets can't be completed): restore 100-200 kcal immediately. This is your body telling you the deficit is too aggressive.\n\n**The nutrition timing protocol:**\n- **Pre-training (60-90 min before):** 60-80g carbs + 25g protein\n- **Post-training (within 1 hour):** 50-60g carbs + 35-40g protein\n- **Pre-sleep:** Casein shake (30g protein) \u2014 supports overnight MPS\n\n**The bottom line:** You can lose 15 lbs while improving Hyrox performance \u2014 but you need to be patient (16 weeks, not 8), disciplined with tracking, and willing to accept that the weight loss and the training are equally important goals that require careful balance.",

Remove completely\n- Sleep target: 9+ hours per night.

Total: 25-30 miles\n- Strength: 2 sessions, 3 sets each, 80-85% of normal loads\n- HIIT: 1 session, 50% volume (2 stations instead of 4)\n- If resting HR is back within 3 bpm of baseline: proceed to Week 3\n- If HR still elevated: extend deload for another 3-4 days\n\n**Week 3 (Race-Specific \u2014 Days 15-21):**\n- Running: 4 runs (one tempo, one easy), 2 HIIT sessions at 70% volume\n- Strength: 2 sessions, 3 sets each at 85% (maintenance only)\n- Race simulation: partial or full, depending on how you feel\n- Begin carb-loading protocol (8 g/kg) 3 days before your race\n\n**Week 4 (Race Week):**\n- Taper protocol: reduce volume 30-40% while maintaining intensity\n- Monday: easy 4-mile run + 2-mile shakeout + strides\n- Tuesday: light HIIT (2 stations, 50% reps)\n- Wednesday: Complete rest\n- Thursday: 2-mile easy jog + race prep\n- Friday: Rest. Eat. Hydrate. Sleep.\n- Saturday/Sunday: RACE\n\n**The science of what's happening:**\nWhen you push into overreaching, your body needs 10-14 days of reduced training stress to recover. The deload week gives that to you. Week 2 tests whether the recovery is real. Week 3 is your race-specific sharpening. Week 4 is the taper, where fitness is expressed.\n\n**The key insight:** Athletes who experience overreaching but then receive adequate recovery often **supercompensate** \u2014 they come back stronger than before the overreaching began. Your 8-beat elevated HR is a warning sign, not a death sentence. Listen to it, back off, and you'll show up to race day stronger and fresher than if you'd just pushed through.\n\n**Cancel any sessions you have planned for the next 7 days. The only thing on your schedule is recovery.**",

It's a signal that something needs to change \u2014 and I'm going to give you the exact changes.\n\n**Why your lower back is getting hammered:**\n\nThe sled push and sled pull are both compound exercises that load your entire posterior chain \u2014 glutes, hamstrings, lats, spinal erectors. When your technique breaks down under heavy load, your lower back (erector spinae) takes on more than its share. Here's what's probably happening:\n\n**1. Sled Push (most common cause):**\nYou're pushing the sled with a rounded back. When you lose your lumbar position and your trunk collapses, your spinal erectors fire maximally to compensate. 50m of heavy sled pushing with a compromised spine = lower back soreness for days.\n\n**Fix:** Lock in your position BEFORE you start pushing. Hips low, chest up, squeeze your lats to create a rigid trunk. Think \"plank pushing the floor away.\" Film yourself from the side \u2014 if your back is rounded, you found the problem.\n\n**2. Sled Pull (rope work):**\nYou're using arm-only pulls with a rounded trunk instead of hip extension. Each pull becomes a mini deadlift with poor form.\n\n**Fix:** Switch to hip extension pulls. Grab the rope, extend your hips (like a kettlebell swing), let your arms guide the rope. Your lats and glutes do the work, not your lower back. Keep your trunk vertical and rigid throughout.\n\n**3. Weak core = compensatory extension:**\nIf your transverse abdominis is weak, your trunk can't maintain position under load. Your lower back overextends to compensate.\n\n**Fix:** Add 2-3 core sessions per week focusing on anti-extension work \u2014 pallof press, dead bugs, reverse crunches with a 3-second hold at the top.\n\n**4. Cumulative fatigue:**\nIf you're doing sled work at the end of a long session, your core and spinal stabilizers are already fatigued. Technique breaks down, lower back takes over.\n\n**Fix:** Move sled work to the beginning of sessions when you're freshest. Or separate sled and deadlift days entirely.\n\n**Immediate relief:** Stop doing sled work that aggravates the issue until you've fixed the technique. Spend 2 weeks rebuilding with lighter loads and perfect form. The soreness will resolve on its own once the mechanical stress is removed.\n\n**The test:** Do a sled session with perfect technique (film yourself). If your lower back is NOT sore the next day, you just proved that technique was the cause. Now scale back up gradually with proper form.",

I'll tell you what they are, why they happen, and the rule that prevents them.\n\n**Mistake 1: Going out too fast on Run 1.**\nEveryone does this. Adrenaline is pumping, the crowd is cheering, you've been training for months. The result: you run Run 1 at your 5K pace instead of your Hyrox pace, and you pay for it by Station 3-4. Rule: Run 1 should be **10-15 seconds per km SLOWER** than your comfortable 10K pace.\n\n**Mistake 2: Not pacing the sled push.**\nFirst-timers sprint the first 12.5m of the sled push because it feels manageable with fresh legs. By the third 12.5m length, they're dying. Rule: **lock into a steady cadence from the first step.** If you can maintain the same pace on length 1 and length 8, you paced it correctly.\n\n**Mistake 3: Using a death grip on the sled pull.**\nGripping the rope tightly doesn't pull the sled faster \u2014 it just fatigues your forearms and biceps. Rule: **grip the rope as lightly as possible while maintaining control.** Your arms should be hooks, not engines.\n\n**Mistake 4: Jumping into burpees without a break.**\nDoing 80 burpees in sets of 20 with no rest sounds great until you hit set 3 and your heart rate spikes to 185. Rule: **do burpees in planned sets with planned rest.** 4 x 20 with 5-second pauses between sets beats 2 x 40 with 30-second gasping breaks.\n\n**Mistake 5: Not practicing transitions.**\nFirst-timers lose 30-60 seconds in the transition zone between the run course and the station because they're disoriented or don't know where to go. Rule: **walk the venue before your start time.** Know where your station is, where water is, where the run exit is. Transition time is free time \u2014 eliminate it.\n\n**Mistake 6: Not having a wall ball break strategy.**\nTrying to do 100 wall balls unbroken when you've never done more than 30 in training. Rule: **plan your break strategy before the race.** 4 x 25 with 5-second pauses is a sustainable plan for a first-timer.\n\n**Mistake 7: Skipping nutrition.**\nNot eating or drinking during the race because \"I don't want to stop.\" Result: bonking at Station 6-7. Rule: **carry a gel and take it during the run between stations 4 and 5.** Sip water whenever it's offered.\n\n**Mistake 8: Not knowing the rules.**\nStarting the sled push with bad foot position because you didn't know the rules. Doing burpees in the wrong zone. Rule: **read and memorize the rulebook before race day.** Know what is 2-minute penalty and what is DQ.\n\nAvoid these eight mistakes and you'll finish in the top half of first-timers. Beat them, and you're in contention for a competitive time.",

      "response": "The wall after Station 5 is the most common pattern I see, and it's a combination of three things:\n\n**The physiological explanation:**\n- **Accumulated glycogen depletion:** By Station 5 (halfway), you've burned 400-600g of glycogen without adequate replenishment. Your muscles are literally running out of fuel. Your brain is also glycogen-dependent, which is why you feel mentally defeated.\n- **Lactate accumulation:** Five stations of high-intensity work with insufficient recovery has blood lactate at 7-8+ mmol/L. Your body can't clear it fast enough.\n- **Cardiac drift:** Your HR is higher at the same pace as the start. Your cardiovascular system is fatigued.\n\n**The training fix:**\n\n**1. Compromised running training (2x/week):**\nAfter every station in your HIIT sessions, immediately run 800m at race pace. This trains your body to flush lactate while maintaining output.\n\n**Specific session:** 5 rounds of Row 500m \u2192 800m run \u2192 Wall Balls x 20. 3:00 rest between rounds. Track your run splits \u2014 variance >15 sec = lactate clearance failure.\n\n**2. Glycogen sparing:**\n- **Zone 2 base:** 3-4x/week to build mitochondrial density and fat oxidation. This postpones glycogen burn.\n- **Station-specific intervals in Zone 2-3:** Sled push 4x12.5m at easy pace, rest 90 sec. 4 rounds. This teaches your muscles to use fat at low intensity, preserving glycogen for the second half.\n\n**3. Half-race simulations monthly:**\nDo Stations 1-4, then REST 5 minutes, then Stations 5-8. The rest simulates your mental/physical reset. Track your pace before and after the break. If your second-half pace degrades >10% = glycogen depletion is your primary limiter.\n\n**4. Carb loading for race week:**\n8-12 g/kg carbs for 3 days before. This maxes out glycogen stores so you have more fuel to deplete. On race morning: 100-150g carbs 2-3 hours before.\n\n**The race-day fueling fix:**\nYou're probably not eating enough DURING the race. Take a gel (25g carbs) after Station 4 (midpoint) and sip electrolyte drink at every water station. This provides 40-60g of carbs during the second half \u2014 exactly when glycogen is depleting.\n\n**The mental reframe:**\nStop thinking of the race as \"8 stations.\" Think of it as **two 4-station halves separated by a rest.** The rest after Station 4 is your halftime reset. Take 10 deep breaths, visualize the second half, and remind yourself you've trained for this.\n\nThe wall after Station 5 is not a fitness problem \u2014 it's a fueling and pacing problem. Fix the fuel, train the second-half simulation, and the wall disappears.",

      "response": "Absolutely not too old \u2014 but you need to approach this with a clear understanding of what age means for your training. Let me give you the honest picture.\n\n**The good news:**\n- Hyrox has a 60+ age group. You're not even in the oldest bracket.\n- Many first-timers finish in their 50s and beyond with proper training.\n- The race format \u2014 8 x 1 km runs with stations \u2014 actually works in your favor compared to a continuous endurance event. The station breaks give your cardiovascular system micro-recoveries that younger athletes don't get the benefit of.\n\n**What age 52 specifically means for your training:**\n\n**1. Recovery time is longer.** Plan for 72-96 hours between high-intensity sessions instead of the 48 hours younger athletes use. This means your training week needs to be structured with more recovery days. Example: HIIT on Monday and Thursday, strength on Wednesday, long run on Saturday \u2014 with Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday as rest or very easy 20-minute Zone 2 walks.\n\n**2. Mobility and flexibility are critical.** Tissue elasticity decreases with age. Invest 15 minutes before every session in dynamic stretching (leg swings, hip circles, thoracic mobility) and 10 minutes after in foam rolling. This isn't optional \u2014 it's injury prevention.\n\n**3. Volume needs to be managed.** Your total weekly mileage should peak at 25-30 miles, not 35-40. You can still build excellent aerobic fitness at lower volume with higher consistency and smarter intensity distribution.\n\n**4. Strength maintenance is your priority.** At 52, you're in the age range where sarcopenia (muscle loss) becomes a real concern if you don't train for it. Two strength sessions per week with compound movements (squat, deadlift, press) at moderate loads is non-negotiable.\n\n**5. Sleep quality matters more.** As you age, sleep efficiency decreases naturally. Target 8 hours in bed, use a magnesium glycinate supplement (200-400 mg before bed), and cool your bedroom to 18-20C. Growth hormone secretion \u2014 critical for recovery \u2014 peaks during deep sleep.\n\n**6. Cardiovascular response is slower.** Your heart rate takes longer to recover between intervals. That's okay \u2014 just use longer recovery periods between HIIT rounds (90 seconds instead of 60).\n\n**Realistic race time for a 52-year-old first-timer:** 1:35-2:00 depending on your current fitness base. The Pro men's winner finishes in ~53 minutes \u2014 but the 60+ age group median is around 2:05. You'll be competing against age-group peers, not 25-year-old elites.\n\n**Training timeline:** If you have a solid running base (20+ miles/week), you need 16 weeks minimum. If you're starting from scratch, give yourself 24 weeks.\n\nDon't compare yourself to younger athletes. Compare yourself to where you were 4 weeks ago. That's your competition.",

      "response": "Completely normal. Let me explain why the women's weights are deceptively challenging for your specific stations.\n\nThe women's weights are:\n- Farmer carry: 2x16kg = 32kg total\n- Sled push: 102kg (including sled)\n- Sled pull: 78kg (including sled)\n\nThe issue isn't the weight in absolute terms \u2014 it's **relative to your body weight** and how Hyrox stations tax different body parts.\n\n**Why farmer carry is hard for you at 140lbs:**\nThe farmer carry at 2x16kg (32kg total) is **23% of your body weight** per hand. Research shows that carries become \"very heavy\" at 20-30% BW per hand. You're right at that threshold. For a 140lb woman, 32kg total is genuinely challenging \u2014 you need serious grip endurance and core stability to manage it for 200m without setting down.\n\n**Why sled push is hard at 102kg:**\nThe sled push is 73% of your body weight. For comparison, the men's sled push at 152kg is 75% of body weight for an 80kg male. The relative load is nearly identical. The difference is that men generally have more absolute lower body strength and muscle mass in their quads and glutes. At 140lbs, you need exceptional technique and leg drive efficiency to push 102kg on competition carpet.\n\n**The good news \u2014 these stations respond to training:**\nGrip endurance and sled push technique are highly trainable. You don't need to add 20lbs of muscle to get better at these stations. Here's what to focus on:\n\n**Farmer Carry Program (3x/week):**\n1. **Heavy carries:** 2x16kg for max distance. Walk 200m unbroken, rest 2 min, repeat 3x.\n2. **Grip endurance circuit:** Dead hang (3x max hold), towel pull-ups (3x5), plate pinches (3x30s).\n3. **Core stability:** Farmers carry with a 20lb weight vest, Pallof press 3x12/side, side plank 3x45s/side.\n\n**Sled Push Program (2-3x/week):**\n1. **Heavy days:** 6x12.5m at 102kg (race weight), 90s rest between lengths.\n2. **Speed days:** 6x12.5m at 80% race weight (82kg), focus on maximum leg drive speed.\n3. **Technique:** 45-degree lean, short rapid steps, drive through the balls of your feet.\n\n**In 4-6 weeks of dedicated training on these two stations, you'll see significant improvement.** The weights won't feel light, but they'll feel manageable, and that's the difference between a 2:30 station and a 4:00 station.",

      "response": "This is one of the most debated topics in Hyrox, and the answer depends on your strengths, weaknesses, and priorities. Let me give you the honest breakdown.\n\n**Running Shoes (e.g., Nike Vaporfly, Saucony Guide)**\nBest for: **Runners who prioritize running segments** (you're under 4:30/km). Lighter, more cushion, better energy return.\nWorst for: Sled push, sled pull \u2014 the soft foam compresses under heavy lateral load, making you unstable.\n**Running shoe athlete:** If you're running sub-4:00/km and the stations are your weakness, a running shoe gives you maximum running economy. Compromise on sleds.\n\n**Cross-Trainers (e.g., Nike Metcon 8, Reebok Nano X4)**\nBest for: **Athletes who prioritize station performance** (stations are your strength). Flat, stable heel for sled push, rope work, and lunges. Good grip for sled pull.\nWorst for: Running comfort on hard convention center floors over 8km. Less cushion = more impact on knees and feet.\n**Cross-trainer athlete:** If stations are your strength and running is your weakness, a cross-trainer lets you dominate stations and survive the runs.\n\n**Hybrid Approach (My Recommendation for Most Athletes)**\nWear a **hybrid cross-training shoe** that balances cushioning with a flat, grippy sole. Examples:\n- **TYR CXT-1** \u2014 specifically designed for Hyrox, with moderate cushion and a wide, stable base\n- **Nike Free Metcon** \u2014 combines the Metcon's flat heel with Free sole flexibility and cushion\n- **Reebok Nano X4** \u2014 the X4 has more cushion than the Nano X2 while maintaining a flat platform\n\n**Why a hybrid is usually best:** Most Hyrox athletes are **middle-of-the-pack runners** (4:30-5:30/km) who need to be **competent at both** running and stations. A pure running shoe or pure cross-trainer creates a weakness that costs more time than the hybrid costs in either domain.\n\n**Sole hardness test:** Press your thumb into the midsole. If it compresses significantly (running shoe), you'll be unstable on sleds. If it barely gives (pure cross-trainer), your knees will hate you after 8km. The hybrid should have **moderate give** \u2014 firm enough for stability, cushioned enough for comfort over distance.\n\n**My bottom line:** Unless you're a sub-3:45/km runner or a competitive CrossFitter, a hybrid shoe is the smart choice. It lets you be above-average at everything rather than excellent at one thing and poor at another.",

      "response": "Here's your complete race day gear list. This is what you need, what's optional, and what you can completely skip.\n\n**Mandatory:**\n- **Good indoor running shoes** \u2014 This is the single most important piece of gear. Go for a hybrid cross-trainer with moderate cushion and decent grip. Nike Metcon, Reebok Nano, TYR CXT-1, or similar. Do NOT wear pure road running shoes (too slippery on turf) and do NOT wear heavy lifting shoes (too stiff for running).\n- **Moisture-wicking clothing** \u2014 Synthetic fabrics only. Cotton absorbs sweat, gets heavy, and causes chafing. A tank top or t-shirt + shorts or compression shorts. Dress for 10-15 degrees warmer than you feel at the start \u2014 the venue gets hot with hundreds of bodies.\n- **Socks** \u2014 Mid-calf compression socks are recommended. They help with blood flow during the 8km of running and can reduce calf fatigue. Plus they're the standard issue for Hyrox \u2014 you'll fit right in.\n\n**Recommended (but not mandatory):**\n- **Liquid chalk** \u2014 This is essentially mandatory unless you have sweaty hands. Apply it before the race starts and reapply at the Roxzone water stations if your hands get wet. It makes a massive difference on farmer's carry handles and sled pull rope.\n- **Race belt or bib clips** \u2014 A race belt lets you attach your bib anywhere on your body without pinning it to your shirt. This is especially useful for the burpee broad jumps where a pinned bib can bunch up and chafe. Or use bib clips on your shirt \u2014 either works.\n- **GPS watch** \u2014 Optional but recommended. Set it to show current pace, elapsed time, and lap/split mode. This helps you stay on target during runs and manage your Roxzone transitions.\n\n**Optional (for specific situations):**\n- **Gloves** \u2014 I generally say no to gloves. They reduce dexterity, make gripping the sled pull rope harder, and can make the farmer's carry handles feel slippery. But if you have hand tears or specific grip issues, a thin fingerless glove is acceptable. Do NOT wear full-finger weightlifting gloves \u2014 they're too hot and too restrictive.\n- **Wrist wraps** \u2014 Not necessary for Hyrox. The loads are moderate (two 16kg KBs for carry, 20kg sandbag for lunges) and wrist support is not a limiter. Wrist wraps also reduce wrist mobility, which you need for sled pulling and rowing.\n- **Knee sleeves** \u2014 Same reasoning as wrist wraps. Not needed for the loads you're handling.\n- **Compression arm sleeves** \u2014 Purely for sun protection or style. They don't provide any performance benefit.\n\n**What to skip entirely:**\n- **Weightlifting shoes** \u2014 Too stiff, too heavy, too much heel. You're running 8km \u2014 you need cushion and flexibility.\n- **CrossFit-style knee-high socks** \u2014 Too hot, too sweaty. Mid-calf compression socks are the sweet spot.\n- **Thick fitness trackers or smartwatches** \u2014 They catch on things during sled push and burpee broad jumps. Wear a slim GPS watch or go without.\n\n**The bottom line:** Good shoes, good socks, synthetic clothing, liquid chalk, and a race belt. That's 90% of what you need. Everything else is personal preference.",

In fact, trying to is a recipe for disaster.\n\nHere's the mental shift: **break it into chunks you can manage.** Most athletes break wall balls into sets of 10 or 15 with 3-5 second rests. That's 6-10 manageable chunks, not one overwhelming task.\n\n**Mental rehearsal (do this daily for 2 weeks before race):**\n- Close your eyes and visualize yourself at the wall ball station\n- See yourself throwing 10 balls in a row (not 100 \u2014 just 10)\n- See the ball hitting the target, feel the rhythm of the squat and throw\n- Count them in your head: \"1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 9... 10. Rest.\"\n- Visualize the rest \u2014 set the ball down, shake arms, take 3 deep breaths, pick up, go again\n- See yourself doing this 10 times (for 100 total)\n\n**Race-day mindset:** When you arrive at the wall ball station, don't look at the ball and think \"100.\" Think \"10 at a time. First set of 10, then I rest.\" Your brain can handle \"10.\" It's just like a set in the gym.\n\n**Physical prep that builds confidence:**\n- In training, build up to 50 unbroken at race weight. If you can do 50, you know you can do 100 with rests.\n- Practice the break strategy: 10 x 10 with 5 sec rest. Time it. Know your pace.\n- Practice wall balls AFTER other station work (like lunges or a run). Race-day wall balls come after 7km of running and 7 stations \u2014 they're tired legs. Train tired.\n\n**Race-day tactical tip:** If you feel your form breaking \u2014 short squats, missed throws \u2014 take an extra rest before things get worse. A 5-second rest now saves you from a 30-second collapse later.\n\n**The truth about wall balls:** They're the last station. You're almost done. Everything you've trained for comes down to this. Most people don't fail wall balls because they can't do them \u2014 they fail because they're already destroyed from bad pacing in earlier stations. If you've managed your energy, the wall balls are hard but doable.\n\n**Count DOWN, not up.** \"90 to go\" is demoralizing. \"Only 10 more in this set\" is manageable. \"I've done 40\" is progress. Focus on the next throw, not the total remaining.\n\nYou've got this. Break it into chunks, trust your training, and throw one ball at a time.",

      "response": "Stations 4-6 (Burpee Broad Jumps, Rowing, Farmer's Carry) are the psychological tipping point of Hyrox. This is where cumulative fatigue peaks and the race feels like it's never ending. Here's how elite athletes stay locked in.\n\n**The Mental Framework for the Mid-Race Grind:**\n\n1. **Think \"which race\" not \"how much longer.\"** You're not thinking about the remaining 40 minutes. You're thinking, \"I'm in the rowing race right now. I need to win this 1 km.\" Then it's \"I'm in the carry race.\" Break it into micro-competitions.\n\n2. **Pain is not a reason to slow down.** It's a signal that you're at the effort level required to achieve your goal. The question is: \"Is this pain functional (I'm working hard) or dysfunctional (I'm injured)?\" If it's functional pain, push through. If it's a sharp, localized pain in a joint or muscle, back off.\n\n3. **The 3-Breath Rule:** When you feel like quitting, make 3 conscious breaths before making any decision. Breathe in through your nose for a 4-count, hold for a 2-count, breathe out through your mouth for a 6-count. This activates your parasympathetic nervous system and gives you a micro-recovery. Most of the time, after 3 breaths, you can keep going.\n\n4. **The 5-Second Rule:** When your brain tells you to stop, wait 5 seconds before acting. 5 seconds of discomfort is manageable. Most people give up 5 seconds before their breakpoint.\n\n5. **Mantras work.** Simple, repeating phrases like \"Smooth is fast\" or \"One more\" or \"Let's go\" are proven to reduce perceived exertion by up to 10%. Choose one before race day and practice it during hard training sessions.\n\n6. **Remember why you started.** What got you into Hyrox? What's your \"why\"? Think about that person who signed up for this race months ago. You didn't come this far to give up at Station 5.\n\n**Specific strategies for Stations 4-6:**\n\n- **BBJ (Station 4):** Break it into smaller sets. Instead of thinking \"I have 80 m,\" think \"I have 4 x 20 m.\" Take a 3-breath rest between each 20 m. Use the rest to lower your heart rate. The BBJ is the station where most time is lost to mental quitting, not physical inability.\n\n- **Rowing (Station 5):** This is where you sit down and can catch your breath. Use it as tactical recovery. Set a split target (1:55/500 m for example) and hit it consistently. Don't go too hard \u2014 save your legs for the remaining stations. The rower is mental relief because you're seated, but don't get complacent. Stay focused on each stroke.\n\n- **Farmer's Carry (Station 6):** This is where grip and leg fatigue combine. Pre-plan your break strategy: \"I'll go 100 m unbroken, take a 5-second grip reset, go 100 m unbroken.\" Have your chalk ready. Walk FAST \u2014 this is not a leisurely carry. Long strides, tall posture, eyes forward.\n\n**Training specifically for mental toughness:**\n\nIn your next 3 training sessions, include a \"mental toughness\" component:\n- Session 1: 5 x 1 km run at race pace with 10 burpees between each km. The burpees simulate the transition pain. Run each km without checking your watch until the last 200 m.\n- Session 2: 80 m BBJ \u2192 1 km row \u2192 200 m farmer's carry, all unbroken. Then 5-minute rest. Repeat. Track your time. If you're more than 10% slower on round 2, your pacing was wrong.\n- Session 3: 1 km run at race pace \u2192 100 wall balls \u2192 1 km run at race pace. Wall balls are the ultimate mental grind station. How fast can you maintain run pace after a station that wants to break you?\n\n**Nutrition for the mid-race push:**\nTake your gel between Station 4 (BBJ) and Station 5 (Rowing). The rower is the perfect place to eat because you're seated and can digest while you work. A caffeine gel (100 mg) will start working by the time you finish the row and hit the farmer's carry \u2014 exactly when you need it most.",

Target: her Zone 3 pace \u2014 maybe 4:35-4:45/km \u2014 where she's working but sustainable, and you're working harder but can maintain.\n\n**Training together before race day is mandatory.** Practice every station split at least 3 times.

Getting to sub-60 means cutting 10% off a race time that's already pretty optimized. Here's the plan.\n\n**Where your 3 minutes are hiding:**\n\nAt 63 minutes, your breakdown might look something like this:\n- Running: ~38:00 (4:45/km average)\n- Stations: ~22:00\n- Transitions: ~3:00\n- Total: 63:00\n\nTo get to 60:00, you need to find 3 minutes from those three sources. Here's where I'd look:\n\n**1. Running improvement: 90-120 seconds**\n\nAt 4:45/km, you're solid but not elite. Sub-60 runners need to average under 4:30/km. That's a 15-second per km improvement \u2014 significant, but achievable with dedicated run training.\n\n- **Run volume:** You're probably running 25-30 miles per week now. Bump to 35-40 miles with one tempo run at 4:15-4:20/km pace (4-5 miles at tempo) and one VO2 max interval session per week (6x800m at 3:50-4:00/km pace with 2 min recovery)\n- **Run pacing discipline:** Your first 3 km cannot be faster than 4:25/km. Many sub-60 athletes go out too fast and die on stations 6-8. Practice negative splitting: km 1-4 at 4:30-4:35, km 5-8 at 4:20-4:25\n\n**2. Station efficiency: 60-90 seconds**\n\nWith 22:00 of station time, you're pretty good but there's always margin. Here's where 60-90 seconds hides:\n\n| Station | Likely Current | Target | Savings |\n|---------|---------------|--------|----------|\n| SkiErg | 3:45 | 3:30 (-15 sec) | 15 sec |\n| Sled Push | 2:30 | 2:15 (-15 sec) | 15 sec |\n| Sled Pull | 2:00 | 1:50 (-10 sec) | 10 sec |\n| BBJ | 4:00 | 3:40 (-20 sec) | 20 sec |\n| Row | 3:30 | 3:15 (-15 sec) | 15 sec |\n| Farmer's | 2:00 | 1:50 (-10 sec) | 10 sec |\n| Lunges | 5:00 | 4:30 (-30 sec) | 30 sec |\n| Wall Balls | 6:00 | 5:30 (-30 sec) | 30 sec |\n| **Total savings** | | | **~75-90 sec** |\n\n**Where station time hides for sub-60 athletes:**\n- **Sled push technique** \u2014 at 152kg, technique is everything. Film yourself from the side. Are your arms locked out? Are you using short 6-8 inch steps at 120+ cadence? Most athletes lose 10-20 seconds with poor body angle alone.\n- **BBJ pacing** \u2014 going 5-10 seconds faster per round but resting twice as long costs you 20-40 seconds total. Consistent tempo is key.\n- **Wall ball break strategy** \u2014 with better muscular endurance from increased HIIT volume, you may be able to go from 5x20 to 4x25 or even 3x33+1x1. Test this in training.\n\n**3. Transitions: 30 seconds**\n\nAt 3:00 for transitions, you're probably moving well but with some mental delays. Sub-60 athletes need under 2:00. Here's how:\n- **Pre-race planning:** KNOW your station order, target times, break strategies, and gel timing before you start\n- **Mental rehearsal:** 30 seconds before each station, visualize the first 3 reps and your target split\n- **Move faster between run course and station area.** Every 5 seconds of walking = 40 seconds over 8 transitions.\n\n**The training changes from your current plan:**\n\n1. **Add a dedicated tempo run** (1x/week, 4-5 miles at 4:15-4:20/km)\n2. **Increase HIIT from 2 to 3 sessions/week** (add a station-specific session at race weight with 2-min transitions between stations)\n3. **Replace one easy run with a VO2 max interval session** (6x800m at 3:50-4:00/km with 2 min recovery)\n4. **Add 2 transition drills per HIIT session** (50m run \u2192 station \u2192 50m run with 10-second transition target)\n5. **Film and analyze every station** at least once every 2 weeks\n\nA 3-minute improvement in 8-12 weeks is aggressive but doable if you're systematic about where the time comes from.",

Here's the evidence-based distribution from the most respected endurance scientists.\n\n**The 5-Zone Model (from Seiler, 2010):**\n\n| Zone | % HRmax | RPE | Breathing | Hyrox Application |\n|------|--------|-----|-----------|--------------------|\n| Zone 1 | <68% | 2-3/10 | Easy, nasal possible | Recovery walks, active recovery |\n| Zone 2 | 68-83% | 4-5/10 | Nasal breathing possible | Aerobic base runs, 3-4x/week |\n| Zone 3 | 84-94% | 6-7/10 | Controlled mouth breathing | Tempo runs, threshold work |\n| Zone 4 | 95-105% | 8-9/10 | Labored, rhythmic | Norwegian 4x4, 30/30 intervals |\n| Zone 5 | >105% | 9-10/10 | Maximal, gasping | Short sprints, station efforts |\n\n**The Distribution (from St\u00f6ggl & Sperlich, 2014):**\n\nFor a Hyrox athlete training 8-12 hours/week:\n- **Zone 1 & 2: 75-80%** of total training time (6-8 hours/week) \u2014 easy runs, walks, active recovery\n- **Zone 3: 5-10%** (0.5-1 hour/week) \u2014 tempo runs, threshold repeats\n- **Zone 4: 5-10%** (0.5-1 hour/week) \u2014 Norwegian 4x4, 30/30 intervals\n- **Zone 5: 5-10%** (0.5-1 hour/week) \u2014 short sprints, station max efforts\n\n**Why the 80/20 Polarization Matters for Hyrox:**\n\nThe Brandt et al. (2025) study showed that Hyrox race time correlates strongly with VO2max (r = -0.71) and lactate threshold (r = -0.73). Zone 2 training builds the aerobic base that directly improves these markers. Without enough Zone 2 volume, you can't sustain the race pace.\n\n**Your Weekly Zone Distribution Example:**\n\n| Day | Session | Zone | Duration |\n|-----|---------|------|----------|\n| Monday | Easy run | Zone 2 | 60 min |\n| Tuesday | HIIT (stations) | Zone 4-5 | 45 min |\n| Wednesday | Easy run | Zone 2 | 45 min |\n| Thursday | Tempo run | Zone 3 | 40 min |\n| Friday | Easy run | Zone 2 | 50 min |\n| Saturday | Norwegian 4x4 | Zone 4 | 35 min |\n| Sunday | Long run (easy) | Zone 2 | 75 min |\n\n**Total Zone 2: ~5 hours/week = 78%**\n**Total Zone 3-5: ~1.5 hours/week = 22%**\n\nThis follows the 80/20 model almost perfectly. Most Hyrox athletes invert this ratio \u2014 they spend 80% of their time in Zone 3-5 and wonder why they're exhausted and plateaued. Don't make that mistake. Build the engine in Zone 2.",

Each race gets a 10-week specific prep block (16-6 before Race 1, 4-14 before Race 2, 14-22 before Race 3).\n2. Strength is maintained, not built, after the first race. The base you build in Phase 1 carries through all three races.\n3. Race 3 is the real target \u2014 the first two races are dress rehearsals where you execute at 90-95%. Race 3 is where you empty the tank.\n4. The active recovery weeks (post-Race 1 weeks 1-3 and post-Race 2 weeks 1-2) are non-negotiable. Skipping recovery is how you get injured during a multi-race season.\n\n**Race-to-race improvement targets:**\n- Race 1: Establish baseline \u2014 execute your training\n- Race 2 (14 weeks later): 3-5% improvement from Race 1\n- Race 3 (8 weeks after Race 2): 5-8% improvement from Race 2\n\nTotal season improvement: 8-13% from first race to last.",

Let me explain why with data.\n\n**The Hyrox vs. Marathon Comparison**\n\n| Metric | Marathon | Hyrox |\n|--------|----------|-------|\n| Total distance | 42.195 km | 8 km running + ~3 km stations = ~11 km total |\n| Duration | 3-6 hours | 60-90+ minutes |\n| Primary demand | Aerobic endurance | Glycolytic capacity + muscular endurance |\n| Heart rate | Sustained at 70-85% HRmax | Spiking to 85-95% HRmax repeatedly |\n| Lactate levels | Steady at 6-7 mmol/L | Spiking to 8-9 mmol/L at stations |\n\nA marathon is **one 42 km run**. Hyrox is **8 x 1 km runs interrupted by 8 all-out station efforts**. They test fundamentally different physiological capacities.\n\n**Why Hyrox is harder than your friend thinks:**\n\n1. **Repeated transitions from aerobic to anaerobic work** \u2014 every station spikes your heart rate and lactate, and then you must settle back into an aerobic running pace. This transition demand is uniquely fatiguing. In a marathon, you settle into a steady state and stay there.\n\n2. **Muscular endurance under aerobic fatigue** \u2014 by Station 5, your muscles are accumulating fatigue from 4 previous stations AND 5 runs. A marathon doesn't ask your muscles to do sled pushes, wall balls, and burpee broad jumps at any point.\n\n3. **Pacing complexity** \u2014 a marathon has one pacing strategy: hold a consistent pace for 26 miles. Hyrox requires managing 8 separate run paces AND 8 separate station efforts. One bad station can destroy your overall time.\n\n4. **Grip fatigue** \u2014 a marathon doesn't require gripping anything. In Hyrox, your grip is taxed at the sled pull, farmer's carry, and wall balls. By the final stations, grip failure is a real performance limiter.\n\n**What's your friend's 5K time?** If he can run a 20-minute 5K and finish a marathon with that fitness, Hyrox will be a rude awakening.",

If you've never pushed a 152kg sled (Men's Open) on competition carpet, you have no idea how it feels. The friction is brutally high. You need specific technique (low body angle, short choppy steps) and you need to have practiced breaking it out of the stall at the start.\n2. **No sled pull technique.** This is the most technique-dependent station. If you pull the rope with arms only, you'll be slow and exhausted. You need to learn the hip extension method \u2014 using your entire posterior chain to pull the sled hand-over-hand.\n3. **No SkiErg or rowing under fatigue.** In CrossFit, you might do a SkiErg or rower within a metcon, but you've never done it after running 1km and then pushing a sled. The pacing is completely different.\n4. **No wall ball endurance.** 100 reps at 6kg to a 10-foot target is a significant muscular endurance challenge. CrossFit rarely programs wall balls for 100 continuous reps.\n5. **No race simulation.** You won't know how stations compound \u2014 how your quads feel after BBJ then running then sled push.\n\n**The Minimum Effective Dose for Hyrox Readiness:**\n\nIf you can't dedicate to full Hyrox-specific training, here's what I'd add to your existing CrossFit + running:\n\n**Add 2 sessions per week:**\n- **Session 1:** Sled work \u2014 push and pull at race weight. Even if it's just 2 x 25m of each once per week. Technique and familiarity are 80% of the battle.\n- **Session 2:** Station practice circuit \u2014 SkiErg 250m, row 250m, wall balls 50 reps, burpees 30 reps, farmers carry 100m. For time. This gives you a taste of the race format.\n\n**Modify your CrossFit:**\n- Add running before your metcons 2x/week (1km run \u2192 WOD format)\n- Prioritize posterior chain work \u2014 your sled pull and rowing depend on it\n- Practice wall balls in sets of 25-50 reps (not the usual CrossFit sets of 10-15)\n\n**My honest assessment:** You can finish in the top third on running + CrossFit alone. But you won't break into the top 20-25% without Hyrox-specific work. The sled alone is worth 2-3 minutes of practice time.",

Each session, pick 2-3 stations and practice them at light effort. Don't time yourself \u2014 just learn the movements.\n\n- Day 1: SkiErg (10 min easy), Row (10 min easy), Wall Balls (3x20 reps with air squat depth)\n- Day 3: Sled Push 50m (light weight, focus on body angle), Sled Pull 50m (light weight, hip extension technique), Burpee Broad Jumps (3x10 reps, step-up method)\n- Day 5: Farmers Carry 100m (light weight, focus on posture), Sandbag Lunges 50m (light weight, step length), Wall Balls (3x25 reps)\n- Day 7: SkiErg + Row combo (5 min each back-to-back), Sled Push + Sled Pull combo (50m each)\n- Day 10: Full station circuit \u2014 all 8 stations in order at light effort. Time it.\n\n**Week 2: Station Efficiency**\nNow that you know what each station feels like, let's make you efficient at them. The key at this stage is pacing discipline \u2014 don't go hard, go smooth.\n\n- Day 12: SkiErg 12 cal sprint (technique focus), Wall Balls 3x30 (no rest between sets), Farmers Carry 200m (metronome-like steps)\n- Day 14: Sled Push 4x50m (2 min rest, consistent splits), Sled Pull 4x50m (2 min rest, hip extension power)\n- Day 15: Row 12 cal sprint (power strokes), Burpee Broad Jumps 4x20 (step-up consistency), Sandbag Lunges 100m (long steps, touch-and-go)\n- Day 17: Half simulation \u2014 4 stations + 4 km. SkiErg, sled push, row, burpee broad jumps with 1 km runs between.\n\n**Week 3: Race Prep**\n- Day 19: Full simulation at 80% effort. All 8 stations + 8 km. This is your dress rehearsal.\n- Day 21: Easy 20-min EMOM \u2014 10 cal SkiErg + 10 wall balls per minute. This is neural priming, not conditioning.\n- Day 22: Rest.\n- Day 23: Rest or 10-min easy jog.\n- Day 24: Race day.\n\n**Three non-negotiable rules for race day:**\n1. **Run all 8 runs at the same pace.** Whatever your first km is, match it for every km. Don't go faster early and blow up later.\n2. **Take a gel during Station 4 (BBJ).** You'll be racing for 60-90+ minutes. You need mid-race fuel.\n3. **Use the step-up burpee method.** Even if you can do jump-ups in training, race day fatigue is different. Save your energy.\n\n**Realistic expectations:** If you're generally fit (can run 5K in under 28 min, do 20 push-ups in a row), your first Hyrox will probably be in the **1:20-1:40 range**. That's fine. That's a solid first race. You'll learn what the stations feel like under fatigue, you'll have race-day data, and you'll be 100% ready to crush your second Hyrox.",

Use strategically \u2014 reserve for simulations and hard sessions |\n| Vitamin D | 1,000-4,000 IU/day | Bone health, immune function, muscle function | General health and recovery. Get blood levels tested; target \u226540 ng/mL |\n\n**Tier 2: Moderate evidence, recommended strategically**\n\n| Supplement | Dose | Timing | Benefit |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Beta-alanine | 3.2-6.4 g/day (split doses to avoid tingling) | Daily for 4+ weeks to saturate muscle carnosine | Delays onset of muscle burn during 60-240 sec high-intensity efforts. Direct benefit for wall balls, burpee broad jumps, SkiErg |\n| Beetroot juice / nitrates | 6.4-12.8 mmol nitrate (~140 ml concentrated shot) | 2-3 hours pre-exercise | May improve running economy by ~1-2%. Best applied to running-heavy training days and race day |\n\n**What I don't recommend:**\n- BCAAs \u2014 you get them from complete protein sources. Don't waste your money.\n- Testosterone boosters \u2014 no evidence for trained athletes.\n- Fat burners / thermogenics \u2014 risk of cardiovascular issues, no proven benefit.\n- High-dose vitamin C + E \u2014 may blunt training adaptations at excessive doses (>1,000 mg C / >400 IU E).\n- \"Pre-workout\" blends \u2014 too much junk filler. Use the individual ingredients listed above.\n\n**Race day protocol:**\n- Creatine: take your normal 5g with breakfast (it's a daily supplement, not an acute booster)\n- Caffeine: 250-500 mg with your pre-race meal (2-3 hours before start)\n- Beetroot shot: 140 ml 2.5 hours before start\n- Beta-alanine: you've been taking it daily for weeks \u2014 it's already saturated\n\n**Beta-alanine loading protocol:**\nStart 4+ weeks before race day. Take 3.2-6.4 g/day, split into 2-4 doses of 800 mg to avoid the tingling (paraesthesia) side effect. It takes 4 weeks of consistent daily intake to saturate muscle carnosine stores to effective levels.

The SkiErg and sleds are the two stations where substitute exercises come closest to replicating race demands. Wall balls you can replicate fairly well. But let me give you the best substitutes and a plan.\n\n**Station-by-Station Substitutes:**\n\n**SkiErg (1000m)** \u2192 **Battle Ropes (30-45 sec) + 10 burpees** (repeat for 3-4 min)\nThe battle ropes mimic the dynamic upper body pulling pattern. Burpees add the full-body conditioning element that SkiErg demands. It's not the same \u2014 SkiErg is a rhythmic, repetitive pull \u2014 but it's the closest you'll get.\n\n**Sled Push (50m)** \u2192 **Heavy Prowler/Plate Push on Turf (or heavy leg press + walking lunges)**\nIf your gym has ANY pushing sled, load it to race weight (152 kg for Men's Open) and push 50 m. If not, do 50 m of walking lunges with a sandbag on your shoulders. The leg press + lunges combo targets the quads/glutes that the sled demands.\n\n**Sled Pull (50m)** \u2192 **Seated Cable Row (heavy, 4x12) + Farmer Carry (200m)**\nThe seated cable row builds the pulling strength. The farmer carry simulates the grip endurance. Together they approximate the posterior chain + grip demand.\n\n**Burpee Broad Jumps (80m)** \u2192 **Burpee Broad Jumps (actual exercise \u2014 no substitute needed)**\nJust find open floor space and do them.\n\n**Rowing (1000m)** \u2192 **Rowing Machine (actual)**\nMost gyms have rowers. Use it.\n\n**Farmers Carry (200m)** \u2192 **Farmers Carry (actual \u2014 2 x 24 kg kettlebells)**\nGyms always have kettlebells. Carry 2x24 kg for 200 m. Done.\n\n**Sandbag Lunges (100m)** \u2192 **Sandbag Lunges (actual \u2014 20 kg)**\nMost functional fitness gyms have sandbags.

      "response": "Your coach is wrong, and I'm going to explain exactly why. CrossFit MetCons are useful for Hyrox \u2014 they build the conditioning foundation \u2014 but \"just do more MetCons\" is a dangerously incomplete answer for several reasons.\n\n**What CrossFit MetCons Actually Provide**\n\n1. **Work capacity across time domains** \u2014 this is real and valuable. Hyrox is essentially a long MetCon (60-90 min for most athletes).\n2. **Mental toughness under fatigue** \u2014 CrossFit competition formats are intense, and that mental resilience transfers.\n3. **Movement familiarity** \u2014 many Hyrox station movements (wall balls, rowing, carries) are identical or similar to CrossFit movements.\n\n**What CrossFit MetCons Completely Miss**\n\nLet me be specific because your coach clearly hasn't thought this through:\n\n1. **Zero running programming.** Hyrox has 8km of running. CrossFit programs maybe 200m-1600m runs within WODs. The aerobic base required for 8km of running between stations does NOT develop from CrossFit alone.\n\n2. **No sled push/pull practice at race weights.** CrossFit rarely programs sled work, and when it does, it's at weights vastly different from Hyrox race weights (152kg push / 103kg pull for men's open).\n\n3. **No race simulation.** A Hyrox race is a continuous 60-90 minute effort with transitions between running and stations. CrossFit WODs are typically 8-20 minutes with rest between rounds. These are completely different physiological demands.\n\n4. **No pacing education.** In CrossFit, you go all out because rounds are short. In Hyrox, going all out on the sled push destroys your next 1km run. Your coach is giving you a strategy that will fail you in the second half of the race.\n\n5. **No zone 2 aerobic base.** CrossFit almost never programs dedicated zone 2 sessions. Yet the aerobic base is what determines how well you recover between stations. Without zone 2 work, your heart rate stays elevated between stations and you accumulate fatigue exponentially.\n\n**What Your Coach Should Be Telling You**\n\n- Add 3-4 runs per week (one long zone 2, one tempo, one interval)\n- Practice every Hyrox station at race weight\n- Do at least one weekly race simulation (4 stations + 4 runs)\n- Learn pacing \u2014 target splits for each run and each station\n\n**My Recommendation**\n\n1. Respect your coach's expertise in CrossFit programming \u2014 they know how to make you fit in a broad sense\n2. Politely explain what Hyrox actually demands and why MetCons alone aren't enough\n3. Ask them to work with you to add Hyrox-specific sessions alongside CrossFit classes\n4. If they refuse to adapt, find a Hyrox-specific program (PRVN Hyrox, LEVLS, or work with me directly)\n\n**The bottom line:** Your coach is giving you a \"close enough\" answer from a CrossFit perspective. Hyrox is a different sport, and close enough doesn't get you to the finish line feeling strong.",

Use Hyrox-specific rep schemes like 5x5 with 90-sec rest.\n\n**If your 5K is over 24 minutes: Cardio is your priority.**\n- You'll survive the stations but the running will destroy you \u2014 especially the 8km total.\n- Each 1km segment will feel like a separate race, and your heart rate will spike between stations.\n- **Fix:** Build to 35-40km running per week. Add 1 tempo run (8km at 75-85% HR) and 1 interval session (7x1km at 4:30-4:45/km with 2-min jog).\n\n**If both are mediocre:**\n- Start with the 4-week strength block (Option B in my Hybrid Approach) followed by the 8-week aerobic block.\n- Don't try to build everything at once \u2014 periodize over 16+ weeks.\n\n**The sweet spot:** A 1.3x BW squat, 1.0x BW deadlift, and a 21-22 minute 5K.

They're designed for road running, not indoor stadium surfaces with tight turns, sled push, lunges, and burpee broad jumps.\n\n**Why Vaporfly and Alphafly Fail at Hyrox:**\n\n**1. Zero Lateral Stability**\nThe Vaporfly's plate is designed for sagittal plane loading (forward/back). The narrow base and stiff carbon plate make it dangerous for lateral movements \u2014 which is basically everything in Hyrox except running. Sled push at 45-degree angles? You'll roll an ankle. Lateral shuffling during lunges? Unstable. The plate acts like a knife edge on turf.\n\n**2. No Traction**\nThe thin, waffle-pattern outsole is designed for smooth road surfaces. On a convention center floor (which has varying traction depending on the venue), you'll be slipping during sled work and lunges. The Alphafly's Zoom Air pods provide cushion but zero grip.\n\n**3. The Plate Breaks Under Lateral Load**\nMultiple athletes have reported plate fractures during Hyrox races specifically because the carbon fiber plate can't handle the shear forces of sled pushing, lunging, and changing direction quickly. You're risking a mid-race equipment failure.\n\n**4. The Stack Height Is Dangerous**\n39mm of stack on the Alphafly and 39.5mm on the Vaporfly Next% means a higher ankle roll risk during any movement that isn't straight-line running. On a fatigued ankle during Station 7 or 8, that's a recipe for a sprain.\n\n**What to do instead:**\nGet a pair of Nike Metcon 8 or Reebok Nano X4. They provide the perfect balance of cushion for the 8km of running, grip for sled work, and stability for everything else. You'll run slightly slower than in Vaporflies \u2014 maybe 5-10 seconds per km \u2014 but you'll save 60+ seconds on sled work and avoid the injury risk entirely.\n\nThe goal of Hyrox isn't to run fast. It's to finish fast. A 1:10/km pace in Metcons that lets you sled push at 100% power beats a 1:05/km pace in Vaporflies where you're tentative on every station.",

        "Not practical for transitions"
      ],
      "response": "No. Leave the weightlifting belt at home. Here's why.\n\n**Sled Push:**\nA belt restricts your breathing and torso movement. During the sled push, you need to maintain a rigid trunk position (plank-style) while generating force from your legs. If your belt is cinched tight, it limits your ability to expand your chest and maintain optimal breathing rhythm. You're pushing 152kg (Men's Open) for 50m \u2014 you need full diaphragmatic breathing, not a restricted core. The belt provides no stability benefit here because the load isn't on your spine \u2014 it's in front of you.\n\n**Farmer Carry:**\nSimilar issue. The belt constricts breathing and doesn't add meaningful stability. You're carrying 2x24kg kettlebells for 200m. The challenge is grip endurance and postural endurance \u2014 not spinal loading. Your core and trunk muscles provide all the stabilization you need if you're standing tall with engaged lats and a packed chin. A belt doesn't make your traps or forearms stronger.\n\n**The bigger problem:**\nA belt traps heat. Hyrox venues are indoor arenas with hundreds of athletes \u2014 they're hot. Adding a belt increases your core temperature. Over the course of an 80-100 minute race, this matters. Every degree of core temperature elevation increases heart rate at the same workload. Without a belt, you lose maybe 1-2% of maximal strength on the sled (negligible at race weight) but you gain better thermoregulation across the entire race.\n\n**When belts ARE appropriate:**\n- Heavy strength training (squats, deadlifts above 80% 1RM)\n- Max-effort lifts in competition\n- Not in endurance events with mixed modalities\n\nSave the 5 seconds of putting it on and the discomfort throughout the race.

      "response": "This is a common question, and I see people mixing these up constantly. Let me be direct: Relay and Doubles are fundamentally different race formats. If you have 4 friends interested, Relay is your format. Here's the exact breakdown.\n\n**Relay (4-person teams, your case):**\n- Each person runs ALL 8 x 1km runs. There's no splitting or skipping.\n- Each person does ONLY 1 station (you choose who does which).\n- Example: Person A does all 8 runs + Sled Push. Person B does all 8 runs + Sled Pull. Person C does all 8 runs + BBJ. Person D does all 8 runs + Rowing.\n- You cannot substitute someone else for a run. If someone can't finish all 8 runs, you DQ.\n- The station selection is flexible \u2014 you can have the strongest person do the heaviest station (sled push) and the weakest person do the lightest station (wall balls).\n\n**Doubles (2-person teams):**\n- Both partners run ALL 8 x 1km runs together (side by side, within 5 seconds).\n- Both partners split the 8 stations however you want (but must do at least 3 each).\n- You can YGIG (You Go / I Go) at any station, meaning one works while the other rests.\n- Doubles has Men's, Women's, and Mixed divisions.\n\n**Key comparison points:**\n- Total running distance: Relay = 8km per person (same as Singles), Doubles = 8km per person. No difference.\n- Station load: Relay = 1 station per person, Doubles = minimum 3 stations per person.\n- Team size: Relay = 4 people, Doubles = 2 people.\n\n**My recommendation for your group of 4:**\nRelay is the obvious choice. Each person runs the full 8km but only does 1 station. It's a great format for a group of friends because the station load is manageable for anyone \u2014 you're only doing 1/8 of the station work.

You're using the biggest, most powerful muscles in your body to drive it forward. The sled pull is a posterior chain/upper back/lat pull \u2014 you're using smaller, upper-body dominant muscles to pull it toward you.\n\nIf the sled pull were 152kg like the push, it would be almost impossible for most athletes to complete. The 49kg difference is what makes the race balanced.

Memorize this.\n\n**Station-by-Station Women's Open Weights:**\n\n| Station | Task | Women's Open Weight |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Station 1** | SkiErg | 1000m (no external weight) |\n| **Station 2** | Sled Push | **102kg total sled weight** |\n| **Station 3** | Sled Pull | **78kg total sled weight** |\n| **Station 4** | Burpee Broad Jump | 80m (bodyweight) |\n| **Station 5** | Rowing | 1000m (no external weight) |\n| **Station 6** | Farmer's Carry | **2 x 16kg kettlebells (32kg total)** |\n| **Station 7** | Sandbag Lunges | **10kg sandbag** |\n| **Station 8** | Wall Balls | **4kg ball / 9ft target (137cm)** |\n\n**Running:** 8 x 1km \u2014 no external weight.\n\n**Total added weight across all stations:** 102 + 78 + 32 + 10 + 4 = **226kg** of external load, plus the SkiErg and rowing ergs which are bodyweight-powered.\n\n**Critical Context:**\n- The sled push (102kg) and sled pull (78kg) are the heaviest stations and should be your primary strength training focus.\n- The farmer's carry (32kg total) sounds light but is actually one of the most time-consuming stations for most women because grip endurance is the limiter, not strength.\n- Wall balls (4kg to 9ft) require 100 reps \u2014 this is more of a muscular endurance test than a strength test.\n\n**Training takeaway:** You need to be comfortable handling at least these weights under fatigued conditions. Don't train with heavier weights just for the sake of it \u2014 train at race weight so you know exactly what race day feels like.",

      "response": "Hyrox is typically held in large indoor venues \u2014 convention centers, exhibition halls, or arenas. The entire race takes place under one roof, with the running course and stations laid out in a compact footprint.\n\n**What this means for you as a runner:**\n\n1. **Flat course.** There are no hills. The running surface is typically a rubberized mat or artificial flooring that's flat from start to finish. No elevation changes, no camber, no uneven terrain. If you've been training on outdoor routes with hills, the flatness can actually be a blessing \u2014 your legs don't have to absorb impact from downhill running or push through inclines.\n\n2. **No wind, no weather.** You race in climate-controlled conditions. No rain, no wind, no heat, no cold. This is a major factor \u2014 you won't lose performance to weather conditions. But it also means you'll be running in a building with hundreds of other athletes and spectators, which creates a unique environment.\n\n3. **Looping course.** The running course is typically a loop or series of connected loops within the venue. You'll pass through the same sections multiple times. This means spectators can see you repeatedly, which is great for energy \u2014 but it also means you see the stations repeatedly, which can be mentally fatiguing.\n\n4. **Tight turns and corners.** Indoor venues means the running course has tight turns, hairpin corners, and possible lane changes. You'll be running on a marked course with barriers, and you need to be comfortable with tight turns at pace. This is something to practice if you've been doing all your training on straight roads or tracks.\n\n5. **Crowd energy.** The indoor setting actually amplifies the crowd. You're running in a confined space with hundreds of people watching. The noise level during the later stations especially (sled pull, wall balls) is deafening. This can be overwhelming if you're not prepared for it. Train with loud music or at crowded group fitness classes to simulate the sensory experience.\n\n**The surface itself:** It varies by venue but is typically a dense rubber matting designed for high-traffic athletic events. It's firmer than a track and softer than concrete. Wear your standard training shoes \u2014 you don't need trail shoes, but a cross-trainer or hybrid running shoe with decent grip handles the surface perfectly.\n\n**The practical takeaway:** The course is flat, indoor, and looping with tight turns. Train for that specifically: do some runs on a track or indoor path and practice running at pace through corners.",

      "response": "Great question \u2014 and this is one of the few technique debates in Hyrox where **both sides have legitimate arguments**. Let me break down the biomechanics so you can make the best decision for YOUR body.\n\n**Locked-out arms (long lever):**\nPros:\n- **Better force transfer.** A rigid arm acts as a long lever arm, transmitting your leg drive directly into the sled with minimal energy loss. Each stride's ground reaction force travels straight into the sled.\n- **Simpler setup.** Lock out, lean in, drive. Fewer moving parts to think about when fatigued.\n- **Generally preferred by heavier athletes** because the longer lever arm helps maintain a lower body angle against a heavier sled.\n\nCons:\n- **Higher shoulder load.** The sled's entire force is transmitted through locked joints. Over 2-3 minutes, this can cause shoulder fatigue and upper back strain, especially if you have any shoulder instability.\n- **Less shock absorption.** Your rigid arm doesn't absorb any of the sled's deceleration between steps. Every stop-start jars your shoulders and can be uncomfortable.\n\n**Bent arms (short lever):**\nPros:\n- **Built-in shock absorption.** Elbows act as hinges, absorbing the sled's deceleration between strides. This is more comfortable for many athletes, especially those with shoulder issues.\n- **Distributes load.** Force is distributed across your shoulders, elbows, and triceps rather than just locked shoulders. Can reduce the risk of shoulder injury.\n- **Preferred by lighter athletes** who struggle to maintain body angle against the sled \u2014 bent arms let you get lower.\n\nCons:\n- **Less efficient force transfer.** Some energy is lost in the elbow joint. Requires slightly more force output for the same sled speed.\n- **Requires more active control.** You need to maintain the optimal bend angle (about 90-120 degrees) through every stride while fatigued.\n\n**My recommendation:** Try both in training and time yourself. Most athletes find that locked-out arms are more efficient but bent arms are more sustainable \u2014 especially in the second half of the race when your shoulders are tired from sled pull and wall balls.\n\n**The real answer that nobody wants to hear:** The arm position matters far less than your **body angle, step cadence, and leg drive.** If you're pushing at 45 degrees with locked arms, you'll lose to someone pushing at 30 degrees with bent arms. Fix your body angle first, then optimize arm position.",

The person who told you 2:45 is normal was actually giving you a slightly conservative estimate \u2014 which isn't bad. It's better to aim for the low end of that range.\n\n**Where 2:45 comes from for intermediate:**\nAt 60-80 cm jump distance (typical intermediate distance), you're looking at roughly **60-70 reps** to cover 80 m. With a rep time of about 3.8-4.2 seconds per rep (including the broad jump), that puts you right around **2:45-3:10**.\n\n**How to hit 2:15 in 8 weeks (breaking into advanced):**\n- Increase jump distance to 80-90 cm (fewer reps needed)\n- Decrease rep time to under 3.5 seconds per rep\n- Practice 3x per week, 4 x 20 m sets with 2 min rest\n\nThat 30-second improvement is worth fighting for \u2014 it's one of the biggest time-saving opportunities in Hyrox.",

      "response": "I need to be honest with you here \u2014 and this may not be what you want to hear. There is no testosterone booster proven to meaningfully enhance Hyrox performance. None. Let me explain why, including why your buddy's turkesterone likely isn't doing what he thinks it is.\n\n**The Evidence Problem**\n\nEvery single testosterone booster on the market has been tested in human studies, and the results are overwhelmingly negative. Here's the ISSN Position Stand summary:\n\n| Supplement | Evidence for Testosterone Boosting | Evidence for Performance Benefit |\n|------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Tribulus terrestris | **No effect** on testosterone or strength | **No benefit** beyond placebo |\n| DHEA | **No proven benefit**; potentially harmful in excess | **No benefit** |\n| D-aspartic acid | **Small, transient effect** (non-clinical significance) | **No performance benefit** |\n| Testosterone-boosting \"stacks\" | **No greater benefit than placebo** | **No performance benefit** |\n| Zinc/magnesium/Copper (ZMC) | Supports normal testosterone health | **Supports performance via hormone regulation, not boosting** |\n\n**Why Your Buddy's Turkesterone Probably Isn't Working**\n\nTurkesterone is the newest fad \u2014 it's being marketed as a \"steroid-like\" plant extract. The problem? There are **zero human trials** demonstrating it raises testosterone or improves performance. The marketing relies on rodent studies and extrapolation. Rodent physiology does not translate to human physiology \u2014 this is a fundamental principle of sports science.\n\nI'd bet your buddy's gains are from:\n1. **Placebo effect** \u2014 he believes it works, so he trains harder\n2. **Better training** \u2014 he started taking it and simultaneously improved his program\n3. **Better recovery** \u2014 the supplement has a relaxing effect, so better sleep = better gains\n\nNone of these are the supplement working as advertised.\n\n**What Actually Works for Performance**\n\nIf you want to optimize your hormones for Hyrox, here's what the evidence supports:\n\n**1. Get enough sleep \u2014 8-10 hours per night.**\nSleep deprivation **decreases testosterone by 15%** in as little as 1 week. Getting enough sleep is the single most powerful testosterone-supporting intervention.\n\n**2. Eat adequate protein \u2014 1.6-2.2 g/kg/day.**\nProtein supports muscle protein synthesis and hormone production. Undereating protein suppresses testosterone and thyroid function.\n\n**3. Keep body fat in a healthy range \u2014 8-15% for men.**\nBelow 5% body fat, testosterone production drops significantly. Above 25%, insulin resistance impairs hormone function.\n\n**4. Take zinc and magnesium.**\nZinc glycinate (15-20 mg/day) and magnesium threonate (400-600 mg/day) support testosterone production and sleep quality. They won't \"boost\" testosterone above normal but ensure you're not deficient.\n\n**5. Train intelligently.**\nOvertraining suppresses testosterone. Follow a structured periodization model with deload weeks. This supports hormonal balance.\n\nInvest your supplement budget in creatine ($0.03/day), beta-alanine ($0.04/day), and caffeine ($0.02/day) \u2014 all of which have A-level evidence for Hyrox performance. Skip the testosterone booster. Your hormones will be better served by the basics.",

That said, here's how I'd approach it.\n\n**Disc herniation impact on Hyrox:**\n\nThe sled push (heavy trunk loading), sled pull (heavy spinal flexion under load), burpee broad jumps (impact landing), and rowing (spinal flexion) are the highest-risk stations. Running and SkiErg are moderate. Wall balls depend on depth \u2014 shallow squats are manageable, deep squats are problematic.\n\n**Station modifications during acute phase (first 6-8 weeks):**\n\n| Station | Modification | Reasoning |\n|--------|-------------|----------|\n| Sled Push | Replace with wall push isometrics 3x30 sec. ZERO axial loading. | No spine compression. |\n| Sled Pull | Hand-over-hand rope pulls seated on floor. No bending. | Controlled, limited ROM. |\n| Burpee Broad Jumps | Replace with step-up burpees (no jump, no impact). | Eliminate landing stress. |\n| Rowing | Gentle, upright posture only. No deep lean. | Limit flexion. |\n| Wall Balls | Use 6kg ball, shallow squats to 30-40\u00b0 depth. | Reduce spinal flexion under load. |\n| SkiErg | Gentle effort, upright. | Moderate risk \u2014 monitor closely. |\n| Running | Maintain, avoid heavy heel striking. | Low-to-moderate impact. |\n| Lunges | Replace with bodyweight squats to 50\u00b0 depth. No forward trunk lean. | Controlled, limited ROM. |\n| Farmers Carry | Light weight only (20-30% normal). 2 min max. | Brief axial loading. |\n\n**Strength training modifications:**\n\n| Lift | Status | Modification |\n|------|--------|-------------|\n| Deadlift | **ELIMINATE** | Direct spinal flexion under max load \u2014 highest risk. |\n| Back Squat | **Modified** | Front squats only, 50-60% normal load, 3x5 at 50-60% 1RM. |\n| Bench Press | **OK** | No spinal loading. Progressive overload. |\n| Overhead Press | **OK** | Upright posture required. |\n| Barbell Row | **Modified** | Light weight, gentle, controlled. No jerking. |\n| Pull-ups | **OK** | Gentle. No kipping. |\n| Lunges (BB) | **Modified** | Step length 0.9-1.0m, shallow depth, no forward lean. |\n| Planks | **OK** | Core stability \u2014 actually beneficial. |\n\n**Pain rules:**\n- If any exercise causes pain radiating down your leg: STOP. Do not push through it.\n- If any exercise causes central low back pain greater than 3/10: STOP.\n- If pain persists after exercise: STOP that exercise permanently.\n\n**Progression (after physician clearance):**\n\n**Phase 1 (0-6 weeks):** Modified program as above. Focus on upper body and lower body isolation work. No axial loading.\n\n**Phase 2 (6-12 weeks):** Gradually reintroduce modified stations. Light sled push (30% race weight). Half-depth squats. Monitor pain daily.\n\n**Phase 3 (12+ weeks):** Attempt full stations at 50% race weight. If clean, progress to 70% then 100%. This may take 4-6 months.\n\n**There is no competition worth a permanent nerve injury.** Some athletes with herniated discs compete successfully with modifications. Others need to reclassify their goal from competitive to participatory. Let the physician determine which path you're on.\n\nRace-day decision: If your back is flaring the week before the race, do NOT compete. Delay entry to the next available race.",
