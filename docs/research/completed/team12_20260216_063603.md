## 1. SLED PUSH TECHNIQUE — Expert Consensus

### The Arm Position Debate

**⚠️ V1 CORRECTION: "Arms locked out" is NOT universally a mistake. It is a legitimate technique used by pro athletes. The coach should present this as a technique choice, not an error.**

There are **three** primary sled push techniques used in competitive Hyrox, each with distinct advocates:

#### Technique 1: Bent Arms / Front Rack (90-120°)
- **Advocates:** HyroxTrainingPlans.com coaching team; widely recommended for intermediate athletes
- **Reasoning:** Arms act as connectors, not pushers. Legs generate 4x more power than shoulders. Bent arms transmit leg power to sled while keeping the athlete's center of mass close to the sled.
- **Data Point:** Biomechanics research cited by HyroxTrainingPlans suggests straight arms increase shoulder fatigue by 15-20% compared to bent arms
- **Best for:** Most athletes, especially those with weaker upper bodies or shoulder issues
- **Drawback:** Requires some shoulder endurance to maintain position

#### Technique 2: Full Lockout / Extended Arms
- **Advocates:** TheProgrm (HYROX training program); Tiago Lousa (HYROX Master Trainer) notes this works for shorter athletes; used by some pro athletes
- **Reasoning:** Creates a "stacked" position that can be less tiring if done correctly. Upper back extension creates efficient force transfer. Eliminates the shoulder fatigue of holding bent arms.
- **Best for:** Shorter athletes who can't reach comfortable bent-arm positions; athletes with good shoulder stability; heavier athletes who can use body weight against the sled
- **Key tip from TheProgrm:** "Start with arms already locked out — pressing the sled with your arms first will tire them out for nothing."
- **Drawback:** Can feel less stable; harder to steer through turns

#### Technique 3: Forearm/Shoulder Wrap (The "Scrum" Position)
- **Advocates:** Centr (HYROX official partner — their guide states "90% of Elite 15 athletes use forearms on the bar"); Tiago Lousa (HYROX Master Trainer); dominant among elite men
- **Reasoning:** Distributes body weight most efficiently onto the sled. Can be "passive" (resting shoulders against poles) or "active" (pulling up on poles to lift the sled and reduce friction). Saves upper body energy.
- **Best for:** Heavier athletes, especially elite/pro men who have enough body mass to leverage against the sled
- **Key insight from Centr:** "This allows you to best distribute your body weight to drive the sled"
- **Drawback:** Requires sufficient height and mass; less accessible for shorter or lighter athletes

#### What Elite Athletes ACTUALLY Do
Per Centr's analysis: **~90% of Elite 15 athletes use the forearm/wrap technique.** Pro men especially favor this due to their body weight advantage. Lighter athletes and women tend to use either the extended arms or bent arms depending on body proportions.

**COACH RECOMMENDATION:** Present all three techniques. Have athletes experiment in training. The "best" technique depends on:
- Body weight and height relative to sled
- Upper body vs. lower body strength ratio
- Shoulder mobility and endurance
- Surface type on race day

### Other Key Sled Push Technique Points

| Element | Consensus Recommendation | Source |
|---------|------------------------|--------|
| **Body angle** | 45-degree torso lean; hips below shoulders. Lower = more horizontal force. Standing too tall pushes DOWN into carpet, increasing friction | HyroxTrainingPlans, Centr, TheProgrm |
| **Foot position** | Hip-width or slightly wider for stability | Multiple sources |
| **Step cadence** | Short, choppy, fast steps generally preferred for consistency; some elite athletes use longer strides for more power per step. Tiago Lousa recommends finding your style — "very small short fast steps or longer stronger steps" | Tiago Lousa, TheProgrm |
| **Foot drive** | Drive through the balls of feet / midfoot, with weight transferring forward | HyroxTrainingPlans |
| **Head position** | Neutral spine, gaze 6 feet ahead on ground. Head up = compromised spinal alignment = lost power transfer | HyroxTrainingPlans, multiple coaches |
| **Grip** | Firm but not death-grip. Save forearm energy for sled pull and farmer's carry later | HyroxTrainingPlans |
| **Starting** | Set position BEFORE first push. Two-foot push-off to break static friction. "Fall forward" into sled to use momentum | TheProgrm |
| **Surface impact** | HYROX turf creates MORE friction than gym floors. Train 10-15% heavier to simulate race conditions | Multiple sources |
| **Hand width** | Shoulder-width or slightly wider for stability and force distribution | HyroxTrainingPlans |

### Sled Push Weights by Division (2025/26 Season)

## 2. SLED PULL TECHNIQUE — Expert Consensus

### Three Primary Techniques

#### 1. Hand-Over-Hand (Arm Over Arm)
- **Description:** Standing or slightly hinged, pulling rope hand-over-hand using primarily upper body
- **Speed:** Fastest technique
- **Sustainability:** Least sustainable; extremely taxing on biceps and forearms; many strong athletes cannot sustain this for full 50m in race context
- **Best for:** Athletes with exceptional upper body pulling endurance; lighter sled weights
- **Key tips:** Use short, choppy pulls (not long sweeping ones). Keep non-working hand on rope before pulling arm finishes to maintain momentum. (Source: Hybrid Athlete Club, multiple coaches)
- **Source quote:** "The fastest technique but is very tiring or possibly even impossible for you to do" — Coach from Hyrox sled pull tutorial

#### 2. Hip Extension / Squat-to-Row (Hybrid)
- **Description:** Set up like a deadlift position. Explosively extend hips while pulling rope to chest. Uses full body — legs, glutes, back, arms.
- **Speed:** Moderate-fast
- **Sustainability:** Good; distributes load across larger muscle groups
- **Best for:** Most athletes; TheProgrm's recommended technique for their HYROX athletes
- **Key detail from TheProgrm:** They recommend a HYBRID — initial hip drive pull followed by walking backward steps. "First you want to get your hips involved... once the sled is moving, keep hips extended, core engaged, arms long, then walk it back"
- **Source:** TheProgrm, ProAthleteGuide (Crush the HYROX sled pull video)

#### 3. Walk-Back Method
- **Description:** Lean back with arms extended, use body weight to pull sled while walking backward
- **Speed:** Slowest
- **Sustainability:** Most sustainable; easiest on upper body
- **Best for:** Pro division (heavier sleds); athletes with weaker upper body pulling strength
- **Key tip:** Keep arms STRAIGHT to spare biceps. Let body weight do the work.
- **Source:** Hybrid Athlete Club, TheProgrm

### Universal Setup Points (ALL Techniques)
1. **Take slack out of rope FIRST** — ropes are slightly stretchy; every inch of slack = wasted effort
2. **Set up like a deadlift** — feet hip-width, neutral spine, core braced
3. **Foot bracing** — feet right at front of white line; press through floor; wider stance than you might think
4. **Rope management** — be aware of excess rope at your feet; drop rope between pulls if preferred
5. **Don't wrap rope around arms** — wastes time and risks injury

### Common Mistakes
- Not removing slack before pulling
- Pulling too high (above chest level)
- Rounding the back / poor spinal position
- Large sweeping arm movements (instead of short, quick pulls)
- Standing too upright — reduces force generation
- Not bracing feet properly — sliding forward instead of moving the sled

### Sled Pull Weights (2025/26 Season)
| Division | Weight (incl. sled) |
|----------|-------------------|
| Women Open | 78 kg |
| Women Pro / Men Open | 103 kg |
| Men Pro | 153 kg |

### Breathing Pattern
Inhale as you prepare/reach for rope; exhale forcefully as you execute the pull. Maintain rhythmic pattern.

## 3. BURPEE BROAD JUMP (BBJ) TECHNIQUE & TIMES

### ⚠️ V1 CORRECTION: BBJ time of 2:45 in a 75-minute plan was UNREALISTICALLY FAST

**Context:** The elite men's *median* BBJ time from the top 15 all-time HYROX performances is **2:21** (Source: RoxLyfe "Average to Elite" analysis). The average Men's Pro BBJ time is **4:35**, and average Men's Open is **5:45**. A 2:45 BBJ in a 75-minute overall plan is faster than most elite athletes — absurd for an intermediate athlete.

### Movement Standards (2025/26 Season)
- Start standing, hands behind the line
- Hands placed near feet (max one foot length away); once placed, cannot move forward
- **Chest MUST touch the ground** (full chest-to-floor required)
- Stand up and jump forward — both feet must take off AND land simultaneously
- Jump length is athlete's choice
- **No forward steps between reps**
- Station complete when athlete jumps across 80m finish line
- Violations: 1st = warning, 2nd = 5m distance penalty
- Feet cannot pass fingertips when rising from ground

### Technique Points

**The Burpee Portion:**
- **Step-down vs. jump-back:** Step-down (placing one knee then the other) is slower per rep BUT more sustainable for heart rate management. Jump-back is faster per rep but spikes HR quickly. Elite athletes typically use jump-back. Intermediate athletes often benefit from step-down.
- **Getting up:** Step-up (one foot at a time) is more sustainable; jump-up is faster but more taxing
- Key from Tiago Lousa: "When you are coming down from the ground it takes a little longer because you are firstly placing one knee on the ground and then the front foot on the ground — this is slow but also your heart rate can [stay lower]"

**The Broad Jump Portion:**
- **Jump distance:** Don't maximize — moderate, consistent jumps are optimal. Very long jumps are taxing on legs and HR. Most athletes cover 80m in **40-60 reps**.
- **Arm swing:** Swing arms forward for momentum — "generates additional momentum and keeps body balanced"
- **Landing:** Land softly, absorb impact, transition immediately into next burpee
- **Breathing:** Inhale during burpee descent, exhale forcefully on the jump

**Key Strategic Insight from Tiago Lousa:** "Don't do short bursts and then try to recover because your heart rate will peak very very quickly and then it will be very hard to get it back down." Consistent pacing > fast start + rest breaks.

### Realistic BBJ Time Benchmarks
**Based on actual race data (Source: TheRoxZone/HyroXY 2026 averages & RoxLyfe Elite analysis):**

| Athlete Level | Overall Finish Target | Realistic BBJ Time | Source/Reasoning |
|--------------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------| 
| World-Class Elite (Men Pro) | ~55-60 min | 2:00-2:30 | Top 15 all-time median: 2:21 (RoxLyfe) |
| Strong Pro (Men) | ~65-70 min | 3:00-4:00 | Below average Pro time of 4:35 |
| Average Pro / Elite Open (Men) | ~75-80 min | 4:00-5:30 | Average Men Pro: 4:35; Average Men Open: 5:45 |
| Competitive Open (Men) | ~80-90 min | 5:00-6:30 | Around Men's Open average |
| Recreational / First-Timer (Men) | ~90-110 min | 6:30-9:00+ | Well above average |
| Elite Pro (Women) | ~65 min | 3:00-3:30 | Top 15 median: ~3:11 (RoxLyfe) |
| Average Pro (Women) | ~85 min | 5:00-5:30 | Average Women Pro: 5:22 |
| Average Open (Women) | ~100 min | 6:30-7:30 | Average Women Open: 7:09 |

## 4. SKIERG TECHNIQUE & PACING

### ⚠️ V1 CORRECTION: 35-40 SPM is NOT "too high" — it depends on the source and athlete

**The actual expert consensus is nuanced and source-dependent:**

| Source | Recommended SPM Range | Context |
|--------|----------------------|---------|
| **James Hall** (world-record erg athlete, via RMR Training Podcast) | **40-48 SPM** | "The sweet spot for most HYROX athletes." Says 30 SPM is "too heavy, too much muscular fatigue" and 60 SPM is "too frantic" |
| **SkiErg for Hyrox video coach** | **35-45 SPM** | "Anywhere between 35 and 45 strokes per minute is probably going to be a good place" |
| **Dr. Alyssa Olenick / Coach Corey Davis** | **Individual — test to find yours** | Stronger athletes = lower SPM (more power per stroke, more recovery); more aerobic athletes = higher SPM |

**CORRECTED GUIDANCE for the AI coach:**
- **Beginner race pace:** 35-42 SPM (lighter, faster strokes to keep flywheel moving without excessive muscular fatigue)
- **Intermediate race pace:** 38-45 SPM
- **Elite race pace:** 40-48 SPM
- **Key principle:** Higher SPM than most people think. The internet myth of "low SPM = efficient" is wrong per James Hall. Too-low SPM creates too much muscular load per stroke.
- **Why going above 48-50 SPM is counterproductive:** Becomes cardiovascularly expensive, form breaks down, can't generate meaningful power per stroke

### SkiErg Technique
- **HINGE, don't squat.** The #1 mistake. Turning SkiErg into a squat movement donates your running legs to fatigue. Should feel like an athletic hip hinge — load, hit, release.
- **Breathing:** Exhale on the pull/drive down, inhale on recovery (1:1 with strokes)
- **Damper Settings:**
  - Men: Start around **5-6** (some even lower)
  - Women: Many should be **1-2**, especially lighter athletes
  - "HYROX isn't a max-power ski test. You don't need to bully the machine." — James Hall

### SkiErg Pacing Strategy
- **Target effort level:** ~5K run effort (strong but controlled, NOT a death sprint)
- **Pacing formula:** If you know your 2K ski pace, race at **2K pace + 5-10 sec/500m**. If you know your 5K ski pace, that's approximately your HYROX target.
- **Strategy:** Even pacing or slight negative split. First 250m should be conservative — don't spike HR early.
- **Key insight from RoxLyfe elite analysis:** The difference between elite and average ski times is only ~30 seconds (men) / ~39 seconds (women). Going 5 sec/500m slower can SIGNIFICANTLY lower HR, costing only 10 seconds total — a worthwhile trade.

### SkiErg 500m Split Targets by Finish Time

| Overall Finish Target | Approximate 500m Ski Split | Total 1000m Time |
|----------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| 60 min (Elite Pro) | ~1:50-1:55 | ~3:45-3:50 |
| 70 min (Strong) | ~2:00-2:10 | ~4:00-4:15 |
| 80 min (Competitive Open) | ~2:10-2:15 | ~4:20-4:30 |
| 90 min (Average) | ~2:15-2:25 | ~4:30-4:50 |
| 100+ min (Beginner) | ~2:30-2:45 | ~5:00-5:30 |

## 5. ROWING TECHNIQUE & PACING IN HYROX

### Hyrox-Specific Rowing Context
- **Station 5** — the midpoint of the race. The ONLY seated station. Strategic recovery opportunity.
- After 5km running + 4 stations, legs are already fatigued
- Everything after rowing requires standing/loaded movement
- "The rower is not where you should be suffering." — RMR Training

### Damper Settings
**HYROX presets the damper for each division:**
- Women Open: Preset to **5**
- Women Pro / Men Open: Preset to **6**
- Men Pro: Preset to **7**

Athletes CAN adjust during the station. However, most coaches recommend staying near preset or going slightly lower.

**Drag Factor recommendations (for training — to match race-day feel):**
| Division | Target Drag Factor | Source |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| Women (preset 5) | ~130-135 | Rowing for Hyrox video |
| Women Pro / Men (preset 6) | ~145 | Rowing for Hyrox video |
| Men Pro (preset 7) | ~165 | Rowing for Hyrox video |

**Elite racing drag factor:** Men ~130, Women ~120 (Source: James Hall via RMR Training — "lighter drag keeps your strokes snappy and repeatable")

**Critical training note:** Gym rowers accumulate dirt, which reduces airflow at the same damper setting. Use DRAG FACTOR (not damper number) to calibrate your training machine to match race conditions.

### Stroke Rate for Hyrox Rowing
- **Target:** 24-28 SPM for most athletes (Source: OnlyGains)
- **James Hall / RMR Training:** 26-30 SPM is the "money range." "Most HYROX athletes row too low. Lower stroke rate = heavier pulls = more leg fatigue."
- **Elite example:** Meg Martin (one of the best in the world) rows ~31 SPM in race rhythm
- **Too slow (under 22):** Leaving time on the table; each stroke too heavy
- **Too fast (over 32):** Getting sloppy, wasting energy

### Rowing Technique
- **Drive sequence:** Legs → Back → Arms (ALWAYS in that order)
- **Recovery sequence:** Arms → Back → Legs (reverse of drive)
- **Power ratio:** 85% legs, 10% core, 5% arms
- **Handle finish:** Lower chest/upper stomach (NOT chin/neck level)
- **Grip:** Loose hook grip — not death grip (save forearms for farmer's carry)
- **Recovery timing:** Should take ~2x as long as the drive phase
- **Key HYROX insight:** Your arms are already fatigued from SkiErg, sled pull, and burpees. LEG DRIVE is your advantage.

### Rowing Pacing Strategy
**Pacing formula:** Your 2K pace + 10 seconds per 500m (Source: James Hall)

**Negative split is recommended** — start conservative, finish fast.

| Approach | 0-250m | 250-750m | 750-1000m | Total Time | Best For |
|----------|--------|----------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Conservative ("Recovery") | 2:05-2:10/500m | 2:05-2:10/500m | 1:55-2:00/500m | ~4:00-4:15 | Struggling athletes; use as active recovery |
| Steady State ("Time Saver") | 1:55-2:00/500m | 1:50-1:55/500m | 1:45-1:50/500m | ~3:40-3:50 | Racing for time, feeling okay |
| Aggressive ("Send It") | 1:45-1:50/500m | 1:42-1:47/500m | 1:40-1:45/500m | ~3:20-3:30 | Elite athletes who can recover on the run |

### Common Rowing Mistakes
1. Pulling with arms before legs extend
2. Hunching/rounding back at the catch
3. Rushing the recovery (should be controlled)
4. Damper setting too high (4-6 is sufficient for most)
5. Death grip on handle (fries forearms before farmer's carry)
6. Going too hard and spiking HR at the race midpoint

## 6. WALL BALL TECHNIQUE

### ⚠️ V1 CORRECTION: Target heights now confirmed from official HYROX rulebook

### Target Heights & Ball Weights (2025/26 Season — OFFICIAL)

| Division | Ball Weight | Target Height |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Women Open | 4 kg (white marking) | **2.70 m (8'10")** |
| Women Pro | 6 kg (grey marking) | **2.70 m (8'10")** |
| Men Open | 6 kg (grey marking) | **3.00 m (9'10")** |
| Men Pro | 9 kg (black marking) | **3.00 m (9'10")** |

**Note for Women Open:** 75 reps (not 100). All other singles divisions: 100 reps.

### Wall Ball Technique
- **Squat:** Full depth (hip crease below knee; referee may use a box to verify). Vertical torso.
- **Drive:** Explosive upward drive from LEGS — the throw is powered by the squat, not the arms
- **Arms:** Keep relaxed during descent; arms guide the ball, legs power the throw
- **Catch:** Receive ball in front rack position, absorb into squat
- **Breathing:** Inhale on descent/catch, exhale on throw (Source: RMR Training, multiple coaches)
- **Rhythm:** Minimize pause at the bottom. Consistent cadence is more important than speed per rep.
- **Cadence:** The speed you drop and pop back up makes an "incredible difference for how long you're under load" — Elite 15 athlete

### Break Strategy for 100 Reps
**From Elite 15 Athlete (Proven Wall Ball Strategies video):**
- **If you can do 50+ unbroken:** "If you can come in there and knock out half of the wall balls right away, you're setting yourself up for such an easier time in the long term." Then do smaller sets for the second half (e.g., 50 + sets of 25, or 50 + sets of 10-15).
- **If you cannot do 50 unbroken:** Use smaller, planned sets with very short rests. Having a plan is critical.

**From RoxLyfe:** "More frequent, but very quick rests, may help your overall time. For example, if you can complete 40 reps unbroken from the start, but that leaves you exhausted... 15 reps each set with a short rest in between might be a better strategy."

**Recommended Break Patterns:**

| Athlete Level | Strategy | Rationale |
|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Elite (can do 100 unbroken in training) | Unbroken or 50/50 | Fastest possible time; Red Bull patch for 100 unbroken |
| Advanced (can do 60+ unbroken fresh) | 50/25/25 or 40/30/30 | Big first set, then manageable remainder |
| Intermediate (30-50 unbroken fresh) | 25/25/25/25 or 20/20/20/20/20 | Consistent sets, very brief rests |
| Beginner (under 25 unbroken) | Sets of 10-15 with 10-15 sec rest | Avoid going to failure; keep rest periods fixed |

**Key principle:** Train to find your sustainable set size. Test with a max wall ball assessment, then race at 60-70% of your max unbroken number per set.

**Mental strategy from Elite 15 athlete:** "Every 10 reps, I visualize myself completing 100 meters on a track. Every rep after that, I'm completing 10m, 20m, 50m."

## 7. FARMER'S CARRY TECHNIQUE

### Weights & Distance (2025/26 Season)
| Division | Weight | Distance |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Women Open | 2 × 16 kg | 200m |
| Women Pro / Men Open | 2 × 24 kg | 200m |
| Men Pro | 2 × 32 kg | 200m |

### Grip Strategy (Critical — This Is the Limiting Factor)
**From TheProgrm (HYROX specialist program):**
1. **Start with a "deep" / false grip:** Handle sits in your palms, not fingers. More taxing on wrist/forearm muscles but SPARES finger strength (usually the limiting factor).
2. **Natural transition:** As false grip gives out, you'll naturally transition to a neutral finger-dominant grip. This buys you several more meters per set.
3. **Don't death-grip:** Firm but not maximum squeeze. You've still got sandbag lunges and wall balls after this.

**Wrist angle:** Slight wrist flexion angle (handle below calluses/main finger joints) activates forearms more for a stronger grip. (Source: TheProgrm video)

### Walking Technique
- **Posture:** Stand TALL. Shoulders back, chest proud. Core braced. Arms fully extended at sides.
- **Gait:** Hip-width or slightly narrower stance. Normal walking gait — don't waddle.
- **Speed:** Walk briskly but not run. This is a posture/grip station, not a sprint.
- **Pickup:** Deadlift the kettlebells with good form — bend knees minimally, back straight, brace core.

### Break Strategy
**TheProgrm's recommended approach: "Short but quick"**
- Break **10-20m BEFORE you think you'll reach grip failure**
- This avoids excessive lactate buildup in forearms
- Keep breaks VERY short (10 seconds is enough to restore grip without wasting time — Source: Hyrox Farmer's Carry tutorial)
- **Multiple short planned breaks > one long unplanned break after total grip failure**

**From TheProgrm:** "The most successful approach we have found with our athletes... consists of breaking sooner than you plan... Overall the goal is to aim to break up the distance a little more frequently than what your max capacity would allow but ensure that those breaks are very quick."

### Strategic Positioning in the Race
This is Station 6 — the Farmer's Carry can serve as a **relative recovery station** (lower intensity, lower HR than many other stations) IF you have adequate grip endurance. It's the only station with turns every ~25m.

### Realistic Time Targets

| Level | Target Time | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| Elite Pro (Men) | 1:30-2:00 | Elite median: 1:37 (RoxLyfe) |
| Elite Pro (Women) | 1:45-2:15 | Elite median: 1:57 |
| Average Pro (Men) | 2:00-2:30 | Average: 2:02 |
| Average Open (Men) | 2:00-2:30 | Average: 2:10 |
| Average Open (Women) | 2:00-2:30 | Average: 2:16 |
| Beginner | 3:00-4:00+ | Dropping KBs multiple times |

---

## 8. SANDBAG LUNGE TECHNIQUE

### Weights & Distance (2025/26 Season)
| Division | Weight | Distance |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Women Open | 10 kg | 100m |
| Women Pro / Men Open | 20 kg | 100m |
| Men Pro | 30 kg | 100m |

### Movement Standards
- Rear knee **MUST touch the ground** every rep
- **Alternate legs** (left, right, left, right)
- **No steps between reps** — you may pause standing between reps with both feet on ground
- **Sandbag MUST stay on both shoulders at all times**
- **Putting the sandbag down = 5 second penalty. Second time = DISQUALIFICATION.**
- Full stand between each rep (straighten knee and hip)
- Foot must completely cross all white lines including turning points and finish line

### How to Hold the Sandbag
**Two main holds:**

1. **Shoulder/Back Position (Recommended by most coaches):**
   - Sandbag sits across BOTH shoulders, behind head
   - Use center handles (gets bag closer to center of gravity) — Source: TheProgrm
   - Pull sandbag in tight
   - **Once secure, RELAX your arms** — "You should be so relaxed that you can let go of one handle and let your arm drop" (Hybrid Athlete Club)

2. **Getting it up:** Pick up with a hip hinge/swing motion. Swing between legs to generate momentum, then use hip power to get it to shoulder. (Source: TheProgrm sandbag tutorial)

**Bear hug** is NOT the standard competitive hold — shoulder carry is almost universally preferred as it allows for more upright torso position and frees the arms somewhat.

### Step Length Optimization
- **Trailing knee directly underneath hips** — creates a "stacked" position (Source: Hybrid Athlete Club)
- Don't over-stride — shorter, controlled steps waste less energy
- Keep torso as upright as possible; avoid folding forward under the bag
- Distribute weight evenly between front and back legs

### Managing Quad Fatigue
This is Station 7 — by this point you've done 7km of running, sled push, sled pull, BBJs, rowing, and farmer's carries. Your quads are already taxed.

**Key strategies:**
- Pace the lunges — don't go out too fast and blow up
- Focus on glute engagement (not just quads) — "squeeze glutes" through each rep
- Train lunges under fatigue in training (after running + other exercises)
- Build joint tolerance with progressive training (deep split squats, heel-elevated squats)
- **RoxLyfe critical insight:** "Practice in training, during certain sessions, moving from running into lunges and back into running." The run AFTER lunges is the cruelest part of the race.

### Why This Station Destroys the Final Run
- 100m of weighted alternating lunges is massive eccentric quad loading
- Quads are the primary running muscle
- Final 1km run immediately follows with destroyed quads
- Athletes often describe the final run as the hardest kilometer of the race despite being the last
- **Training implication:** ALWAYS practice running immediately after lunges in training

## 9. STATION-SPECIFIC BREATHING PATTERNS

| Station | Breathing Pattern | Notes |
|---------|------------------|-------|
| **SkiErg** | Exhale on pull/drive down, inhale on recovery | 1:1 with strokes. Keep rhythmic. |
| **Sled Push** | Rhythmic breathing matched to steps; exhale on drive phase of each step | Don't hold breath. Some athletes use 2-step breathing (exhale every 2 steps). Avoid Valsalva for extended push. |
| **Sled Pull** | Inhale as you prepare/reach for rope; exhale forcefully on the pull | Match breathing to pull rhythm. Core braced throughout. |
| **Burpee Broad Jumps** | Inhale during descent to ground; exhale on the jump | Key from HyroXY: "Inhale deeply as you go down into the burpee and exhale forcefully as you launch into the jump." This optimizes oxygen flow. Maintain CONSISTENCY — erratic breathing spikes HR. |
| **Rowing** | Exhale on the drive (push); inhale on the recovery (slide forward) | Match to stroke cadence. Recovery = controlled rest = breathing opportunity. |
| **Farmer's Carry** | Rhythmic nasal breathing if possible; exhale through mouth if HR is high | This station CAN allow HR recovery. Focus on controlled, steady breathing. Don't hold breath. |
| **Sandbag Lunges** | Exhale on the way UP from each lunge; inhale on the way DOWN | Controlled exertion breathing. The bag on shoulders can restrict breathing — keep chest proud. |
| **Wall Balls** | Exhale on the throw/push; inhale on the catch/descent | Some elite athletes experiment with FLIPPING this pattern — "play around with the breathing sequence to make sure what you're doing is optimal" (Elite 15 athlete). Test in training. |

### 80-MINUTE TARGET (Intermediate — WHERE MOST ATHLETES FALL)

| Segment | Target Time | Cumulative | Notes |
|---------|------------|------------|-------|
| Run 1 | 4:45 | 4:45 | Hold back — do NOT go out at 4:15 |
| SkiErg (1000m) | 4:30 | 9:15 | ~2:15/500m, comfortable effort |
| RoxZone | 0:55 | 10:10 | Jog through, don't walk |
| Run 2 | 4:55 | 15:05 | |
| Sled Push (152kg/102kg) | 3:15 | 18:20 | |
| RoxZone | 0:55 | 19:15 | |
| Run 3 | 5:00 | 24:15 | |
| Sled Pull (103kg/78kg) | 4:00 | 28:15 | |
| RoxZone | 0:55 | 29:10 | |
| Run 4 | 5:05 | 34:15 | Mental checkpoint — halfway done |
| Burpee Broad Jumps (80m) | 5:30 | 39:45 | Consistent moderate pace, step-down OK |
| RoxZone | 0:55 | 40:40 | |
| Run 5 | 5:10 | 45:50 | |
| Row (1000m) | 4:30 | 50:20 | ~2:15/500m, USE as recovery |
| RoxZone | 0:55 | 51:15 | |
| Run 6 | 5:15 | 56:30 | |
| Farmer's Carry (2x24kg/16kg) | 2:30 | 59:00 | 2-3 planned breaks |
| RoxZone | 0:55 | 59:55 | |
| Run 7 | 5:20 | 65:15 | Two stations left |
| Sandbag Lunges (20kg/10kg) | 5:30 | 70:45 | Pace carefully — still have final run |
| RoxZone | 0:55 | 71:40 | |
| Run 8 | 5:30 | 77:10 | Expect slowdown — legs are gone |
| Wall Balls (100 reps) | 6:00 | 83:10 | Sets of 15-20 |
| RoxZone + Finish | 0:50 | **~84:00** | |

**Note:** An 80-minute target may require some segments to be faster than shown. This plan totals closer to 84 minutes — realistic given most athletes slow in the second half. For a true 80-minute finish, run splits need to average closer to 4:45/km and station times need to be tighter. Adjust based on your strengths.

**Revised for strict 80:00:**

| Component | Time Budget |
|-----------|------------|
| 8 × 1km Runs | 40:00 (avg 5:00/km) |
| 8 Stations | 32:00 (avg 4:00/station) |
| RoxZone Total | 8:00 (avg 1:00/transition) |
| **TOTAL** | **80:00** |

---

### 90-MINUTE TARGET (Recreational / First-Timer)

| Segment | Target Time | Cumulative | Notes |
|---------|------------|------------|-------|
| Run 1 | 5:30 | 5:30 | Easy pace, save energy |
| SkiErg (1000m) | 5:00 | 10:30 | ~2:30/500m, smooth strokes |
| RoxZone | 1:10 | 11:40 | Walk if needed, but keep moving |
| Run 2 | 5:40 | 17:20 | |
| Sled Push | 3:45 | 21:05 | Breaks OK if needed |
| RoxZone | 1:10 | 22:15 | |
| Run 3 | 5:45 | 28:00 | |
| Sled Pull | 5:00 | 33:00 | Use walk-back technique |
| RoxZone | 1:10 | 34:10 | |
| Run 4 | 5:50 | 40:00 | Halfway — celebrate internally |
| Burpee Broad Jumps (80m) | 7:00 | 47:00 | Sets of 5-10 if needed, stay moving |
| RoxZone | 1:10 | 48:10 | |
| Run 5 | 5:55 | 54:05 | |
| Row (1000m) | 5:00 | 59:05 | Enjoy sitting down! Recovery pace OK |
| RoxZone | 1:10 | 60:15 | |
| Run 6 | 6:00 | 66:15 | |
| Farmer's Carry | 3:00 | 69:15 | Multiple planned breaks, 10 sec each |
| RoxZone | 1:10 | 70:25 | |
| Run 7 | 6:10 | 76:35 | Slowdown expected |
| Sandbag Lunges | 6:30 | 83:05 | Pace carefully |
| RoxZone | 1:10 | 84:15 | |
| Run 8 | 6:15 | 90:30 | Last push — you've got this |
| Wall Balls (100/75 reps) | 7:30 | 98:00 | Sets of 10 with short rests |
| RoxZone + Finish | 1:00 | **~99:00** | |

**Reality check for 90-minute target:** A true 90-minute finish is actually above-average performance. Most first-timers finish 100-120 minutes. The plan above totals ~99 minutes to be more realistic. For a genuine 90-minute plan, run splits need to average ~5:15/km and stations must be efficient. This requires solid base fitness.

**Adjusted strict 90:00 budget:**

| Component | Time Budget |
|-----------|------------|
| 8 × 1km Runs | 44:00 (avg 5:30/km) |
| 8 Stations | 37:00 (avg ~4:37/station) |
| RoxZone Total | 9:00 (avg ~1:08/transition) |
| **TOTAL** | **90:00** |

---

### HOW EACH STATION AFFECTS THE SUBSEQUENT RUN

| Station Just Completed | Impact on Following Run | Key Management Strategy |
|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **After SkiErg** | **Arms:** Fatigued (lats, shoulders). **Legs:** Slightly loaded from hinging but generally OK. **HR:** Elevated, especially if paced too aggressively. | Start run conservatively. Shake arms out. Don't sprint the first 200m — let HR settle. |
| **After Sled Push** | **Legs:** Quads heavily loaded (pushing motion). Calves fatigued from toe-driving. **Arms:** Shoulders may be tight (especially bent-arm technique). **HR:** Very elevated from anaerobic effort. | This is often the run where pacing discipline matters most. Walk first 50m of RoxZone if needed. Settle before running. |
| **After Sled Pull** | **Arms/Grip:** Biceps, forearms, and lats are pumped. **Legs:** Less taxed than sled push (more upper body). **HR:** Moderately elevated. **Back:** Tight from pulling position. | Good run to find rhythm. Arms will feel heavy but legs should be relatively fresh compared to sled push. |
| **After BBJs** | **EVERYTHING:** Full-body fatigue. Quads from jumping, shoulders from burpees, HR through the roof. This is the halfway point and often the worst athletes feel in the entire race. | This is the "dark moment" of HYROX. The run after BBJ is where many athletes lose their pacing plan. Start VERY slow. Walk if needed for first 100m. Find rhythm gradually. |
| **After Rowing** | **Legs:** Quads and glutes loaded from leg drive. **Posterior chain:** Hamstrings and back worked. **HR:** Should be moderate if paced well (seated = some recovery). **Grip:** Minimally affected if hook grip was used. | Ideally you feel BETTER starting this run than the one after BBJs. The row should serve as partial recovery. Stand up slowly — blood has been in seated position. |
| **After Farmer's Carry** | **Forearms/Grip:** Pumped and fatigued — the limiting factor. **Shoulders:** Tight from stabilizing heavy KBs. **Core:** Fatigued from bracing. **Legs:** Relatively fresh (just walking). **HR:** Should be moderate-low. | This run should feel surprisingly good on legs. Shake out grip. This can be one of your better runs if grip didn't force excessive stopping. |
| **After Sandbag Lunges** | **Quads:** DESTROYED. Massive eccentric loading from 100m of weighted lunges. **Glutes/Hips:** Very fatigued. **Core/Arms:** Moderate fatigue from holding bag. **HR:** High from sustained effort. | THE HARDEST RUN. Expect 15-30+ seconds/km slower than earlier runs. Start walking if needed. Short, quick steps. Don't try to stride long — your quads won't allow it. Elite men's Run 8 is ~30 sec slower than Run 1. Average men: >2 min slower. |
| **After Wall Balls** | **Quads:** Further punished (deep squats × 100). **Shoulders:** Fatigued from throwing. **HR:** High. **Everything:** General fatigue but adrenaline of finishing kicks in. | You're done — it's just the sprint to the finish line through the RoxZone. Empty the tank. This is where crowd energy helps. |

### KEY PACING PRINCIPLES (Supported by Data)

1. **Even pacing is the gold standard** — Athletes who pace within 10% variance across runs finish 5-10% faster than those who sprint-and-fade (Source: HyroxDataLab)

2. **Men especially need to hold back early** — RoxLyfe analysis shows elite men's runs are much flatter across the race vs. average men who go too fast on Run 1 and pay for it later. Women are naturally 18.33% better at even pacing (per marathon studies).

3. **RoxZone time is "free time"** — Elite men spend ~3 minutes total; average men spend ~7 minutes. That's 4 minutes of wasted time just from walking/stopping in transitions.

4. **The biggest time differentiators** between elite and average are: Sled Pull (3:17 gap for men), Wall Balls (3:13 gap), Burpee Broad Jumps (2:54 gap), and RoxZone (4:04 gap). SkiErg and Rowing have the SMALLEST gaps (~30 seconds). Train accordingly.

5. **Don't "win" the SkiErg or Row** — Going 10 seconds slower on SkiErg can save significant HR, potentially saving you 30+ seconds on the subsequent run and sled push. These machines are rhythm stations, not hero moments.

## Original Prompt

```
You are a Hyrox technique and pacing specialist building a knowledge base for an AI-powered Hyrox coach. The coach needs accurate technique consensus from elite coaches AND realistic pacing benchmarks. The v1 model had several issues:
- Listed "Arms locked out" as a sled push MISTAKE (many elite coaches recommend it)
- Gave BBJ time of 2:45 in a 75-minute pacing plan (unrealistically fast)
- Recommended SkiErg stroke rate of 35-40 SPM (too high for most athletes)
- Didn't know wall ball target heights

## 1. Sled Push Technique — Expert Consensus

### The Arm Position Debate
This is genuinely controversial among Hyrox coaches. Research BOTH sides:

**Camp 1: Extended/Locked Arms**
- Who advocates this? (specific coaches, athletes)
- Reasoning: maximizes force transfer from legs through rigid kinetic chain
- When is this best: heavy sled, strong legs, good ankle mobility
- Drawback: less control, harder to steer

**Camp 2: Bent Arms (90-120 degrees)**
- Who advocates this?
- Reasoning: better control, can push through turns, more body engagement
- When is this best: lighter sled, technical courses with turns
- Drawback: arms fatigue, less direct force transfer

**What do ELITE Hyrox athletes actually do?**
- Watch race footage descriptions or interviews
- Is there a dominant technique at the Pro level?

### Other Sled Push Technique Points
- Body angle: how low should you be?
- Foot position: wide vs narrow stance
- Step cadence: short choppy steps vs long strides
- Driving through the balls of feet vs flat foot
- Head position: looking down at sled vs looking forward
- How surface type affects technique (concrete vs rubber vs turf)

## 2. Sled Pull Technique Consensus

### Hand-Over-Hand vs Big Arm Pulls
- Which technique is faster?
- Which is more sustainable for 50m?
- Does rope thickness/type matter?
- Body position during pull (seated vs kneeling vs standing)
- Foot bracing strategy
- Common mistakes (not bracing feet, pulling too high)

## 3. Burpee Broad Jump Technique

### Efficient BBJ Technique
- Step-down vs jump-back for the burpee portion
- Do you need full chest-to-floor? What's the standard?
- Jump distance optimization: how far should each jump be?
- Landing technique to absorb impact
- Arm swing for momentum
- Breathing pattern for BBJs

### Realistic BBJ Time Targets
- For a 60-minute finisher (elite): what BBJ time?
- For a 70-minute finisher (competitive): what BBJ time?
- For a 75-minute finisher (intermediate): what BBJ time? (NOT 2:45 — that's unrealistic)
- For an 80-minute finisher: what BBJ time?
- For a 90-minute finisher (recreational): what BBJ time?

## 4. SkiErg Technique & Pacing

### Stroke Rate Ranges
- Beginner race pace: what SPM?
- Intermediate race pace: what SPM? (research suggests 28-35, NOT 35-40)
- Elite race pace: what SPM?
- Why going above 38-40 SPM is counterproductive for most athletes
- How to find YOUR optimal stroke rate

### Pacing Strategy
- Negative split vs even split vs positive split — which is best?
- First 250m pacing (should be conservative)
- What split time per 500m for various finish time targets?
- Heart rate targets during SkiErg

## 5. Rowing Technique & Pacing in Hyrox

### Hyrox-Specific Rowing
- Damper setting by athlete weight and height (this is athlete-specific)
- Why Hyrox rowing is different from a standalone 1000m test
- Pacing: what 500m split to target for various finish times?
- Common mistakes: pulling too hard early, improper damper setting
- Stroke rate ranges for Hyrox rowing (typically lower than SkiErg)

## 6. Wall Ball Technique

### Target Heights
- Men's target height: what is it exactly? (should be ~3m / 10ft)
- Women's target height: what is it exactly? (should be ~2.7m / 9ft)
- Ball weights by division (Men Open, Women Open, Pro, etc.)

### Break Strategy for 100 Reps
- Unbroken strategy: when is this advisable? For whom?
- Common break patterns: 25-25-25-25 vs 20-20-20-20-20 vs 50-50
- What research/coaching says about optimal break strategy
- How to determine YOUR break strategy based on wall ball max test
- Breathing during wall balls (exhale on push, inhale on catch)

## 7. Farmer's Carry Technique
- Grip strategies to prevent failure
- Posture and walking gait
- When to put weights down vs push through
- Realistic time targets by finish level

## 8. Sandbag Lunge Technique
- How to hold the sandbag (bear hug vs shoulder)
- Knee-to-ground requirement
- Step length optimization
- Managing quad fatigue (this is the LAST station before final run)
- Why this station destroys the final 1km run

## 9. Station-Specific Breathing Patterns

For each of the 8 stations, describe the recommended breathing pattern:
- SkiErg: exhale on pull, inhale on recovery (1:1 with strokes)
- Sled Push: ?
- Sled Pull: ?
- Burpee Broad Jumps: ?
- Rowing: ?
- Farmer's Carry: ?
- Sandbag Lunges: ?
- Wall Balls: ?

## 10. Comprehensive Pacing Plans

### For a 60-Minute Target (Elite/Pro)
Provide expected times for: each 1km run, each station, total transition time

### For a 70-Minute Target (Competitive)
Same breakdown

### For a 80-Minute Target (Intermediate)
Same breakdown — this is where MOST athletes fall

### For a 90-Minute Target (Recreational/First-Timer)
Same breakdown

### How Each Station Affects the Subsequent Run
- After SkiErg: how are legs? Arms? HR?
- After Sled Push: how are legs? (quads especially)
- After Sled Pull: how are arms/grip?
- After BBJs: how is everything? (full body fatigue)
- After Rowing: how are legs? Posterior chain?
- After Farmer's Carry: how are forearms? Shoulders?
- After Sandbag Lunges: how are quads? (destroyed — final run is brutal)
- After Wall Balls: how is everything for the finish sprint?

Provide specific, evidence-based information. Cite elite coaches, athletes, or studies where possible. For time benchmarks, use data from actual race results, not theoretical calculations.
