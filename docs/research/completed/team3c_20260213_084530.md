# Training Programs & Methodologies for Hyrox Race Preparation

## A Comprehensive Research Analysis for AI Coaching System Development

## 1. CrossFit Programming Principles

### 1.1 The CrossFit Methodology: "Constantly Varied, High-Intensity, Functional Movement"

CrossFit's core programming philosophy, as articulated by founder Greg Glassman and reiterated across CrossFit.com's mainsite and Level 1 certification materials, rests on three pillars:

- **Constantly Varied**: Workouts are never predictable. Movement patterns, time domains, loading, and modalities rotate to prevent adaptation and build broad physical preparedness.
- **High Intensity**: Intensity — defined as power output (force × distance / time) — is the primary driver of results. CrossFit prioritizes relative intensity over volume.
- **Functional Movement**: Multi-joint, compound movements that mirror real-world demands — squats, deadlifts, presses, pulls, carries, and locomotion.

**Application to Hyrox**: Hyrox demands exactly these qualities. The race is a chipper of eight 1-km runs interspersed with eight functional stations (ski erg, sled push, sled pull, burpee broad jumps, rowing, farmer's carry, sandbag lunges, wall balls). CrossFit's own official article, *"Why CrossFit Loves Hyrox"* (crossfit.com, January 2026), openly calls the Hyrox race format "one heck of a chipper" and draws direct parallels to classic benchmark WODs like Murph, Clovis, Filthy Fifty, and Glen. The article notes that "CrossFit athletes developed all metabolic pathways, allowing them to show repeated bouts of high-power output… sustained intensity in high-glycolytic events… while having the aerobic capacity to endure through a race that lasts approximately an hour" (Rochet, CrossFit.com, 2026).

### 1.2 Typical CrossFit Class Structure

A standard CrossFit class (typically 60 minutes) follows this template:

| Phase | Duration | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Warm-Up** | 10–15 min | General movement prep, specific skill activation, progressive loading |
| **Strength / Skill** | 15–20 min | Heavy barbell work (squat, deadlift, press, Olympic lifts), gymnastic skill, or specific capacity building |
| **WOD (Workout of the Day)** | 8–25 min | The conditioning piece — the heart of the session |
| **Cool-Down / Accessory** | 5–10 min | Mobility, light accessory work, breathing drills |

According to CrossFit's *Programming Basics: Part 1* (crossfit.com), coaches are taught to design workouts by first determining duration, movement functions, loading parameters, format (single modality, couplet, triplet, chipper), and priority (task vs. time). This systematic approach is something an AI coaching system should absolutely replicate.

### 1.3 Common WOD Formats

| Format | Description | Hyrox Relevance |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **AMRAP** (As Many Rounds As Possible) | Time-priority: max work in a fixed window (e.g., 20 min) | Builds pacing instincts and sustained output — critical for managing energy across 8 stations |
| **For Time** (Task Priority) | Complete prescribed work as fast as possible | Directly mirrors the Hyrox race format: finish the total work as quickly as possible |
| **EMOM** (Every Minute On the Minute) | Perform set work at the start of each minute; rest with remaining time | Teaches interval pacing and work-rest transitions — perfect for simulating run-to-station transitions |
| **Chipper** | Large volume of movements performed sequentially, no repeating | The Hyrox race IS a chipper. This is the single most transferable WOD format. |
| **Tabata** | 8 rounds of 20 sec work / 10 sec rest | Useful for anaerobic capacity but less directly applicable to Hyrox's longer time domain |

### 1.4 Classic CrossFit Workouts That Transfer Well to Hyrox Preparation

**1. "Murph"** — 1-mile run, 100 pull-ups, 200 push-ups, 300 air squats, 1-mile run (with 20-lb vest). The bookended runs with high-volume bodyweight work build exactly the kind of run-under-fatigue capacity Hyrox demands. The time domain (35–60+ min) matches Hyrox race duration.

**2. "Filthy Fifty"** — 50 reps each of 10 different exercises for time. This chipper format teaches athletes to manage effort across multiple stations, pacing through varied movement demands — the fundamental Hyrox skill.

**3. "Chad" (1000-rep chipper)** — 1,000 reps of box step-ups with a 20-lb vest. This trains sustained muscular endurance and mental fortitude through monotonous, high-volume single-movement work — directly applicable to the 100 wall balls or 100m sandbag lunges.

**4. "Glen"** — 30 clean-and-jerks, 1-mile run, 10 rope climbs, 1-mile run, 100 burpees, 1-mile run. The alternating run-and-work structure is remarkably similar to Hyrox's format.

**5. A custom EMOM 40** — e.g., 10 rounds of: Min 1: Row calories, Min 2: Wall balls, Min 3: Sled push, Min 4: Rest. This teaches sustained interval work across machines and functional movements, directly simulating Hyrox race conditions.

### 1.5 What CrossFit Programming Gets RIGHT for Hyrox

- **Work Capacity / Engine Building**: CrossFit's emphasis on sustained high-power output across varied time domains builds the aerobic and anaerobic base that underlies Hyrox performance. The sport of CrossFit literally defines fitness as "work capacity across broad time and modal domains."
- **Metabolic Conditioning**: CrossFit athletes are pre-adapted to every metabolic pathway Hyrox tests — phosphocreatine (burpee broad jumps), glycolytic (sled push/pull, rowing), and oxidative (8 km of running).
- **Mental Toughness**: Long chippers and Hero WODs build the psychological resilience needed to push through the final stations of a Hyrox race. CrossFit athletes are practiced at managing discomfort.
- **Movement Familiarity**: As CrossFit.com notes, CrossFit athletes are "no strangers to the ski erg, rower, sleds, lunges, carries, or burpee broad jumps. And we invented the wall-ball shot" (Rochet, 2026).
- **Mixed-Modal Training**: The concept of combining monostructural cardio with functional movements in a single session is a CrossFit hallmark and the very essence of Hyrox.

### 1.6 What CrossFit Programming MISSES for Hyrox

- **Running Volume**: Standard CrossFit programming includes runs of 200m–1600m within WODs, but rarely prescribes dedicated running sessions. CompTrain includes running 2–3 times per week (comptrain.com/gym-programming-principles), which is ahead of most, but even this is insufficient for the 8 km total running in Hyrox. Mat Fraser himself admitted after his first Hyrox: "The stations I was keeping up just fine. But on the running, there were a couple times I was like, 'O'Keefe, chill'" (BoxLife Magazine, 2025).
- **Specific Station Work**: CrossFit rarely programs 50m sled pushes at Hyrox weights, 100m sandbag lunges, or 200m farmer's carries at prescribed loads. The volume and specificity of these movements differ significantly from CrossFit's approach.
- **Pacing Strategy**: CrossFit often rewards all-out intensity. Hyrox demands strategic pacing across 60–90+ minutes. An athlete who redlines on the sled push may lose minutes on subsequent runs — a skill CrossFit doesn't explicitly train.
- **Aerobic Base / Zone 2 Work**: CrossFit rarely prescribes dedicated low-intensity aerobic sessions. Hyrox performance is heavily dependent on aerobic capacity, which requires deliberate Zone 2 training.
- **Periodization for a Known Event**: CrossFit's "constantly varied" philosophy means it rarely peaks athletes for a specific event. Hyrox athletes need periodized 8–16 week blocks that culminate in race-day readiness.

**AI Coach Takeaway**: Steal CrossFit's chipper and EMOM formats, its scaling methodology, its emphasis on functional movement standards, and its mental toughness development. But layer in dedicated running programming, station-specific practice, and deliberate pacing education.

## 2. Hyrox Official Training Programs

### 2.1 Hyrox Official Training Partnerships

Hyrox does not produce a single, proprietary training app in the way CrossFit.com provides mainsite programming. Instead, Hyrox operates through **Official Online Training Partners**, listed on hyrox.com/hyrox-online-training-partners/. As of 2025–2026, these partners include:

**LEVLS** — The primary official Hyrox training partner. LEVLS offers two main programs:
- **HYROX Race**: A structured, progressive program building toward a specific race date, incorporating all 8 station movements with benchmark workouts.
- **HYROX Daily**: Ongoing training for year-round Hyrox fitness.

LEVLS uses "tried and tested progressive methodology" with benchmark workouts at each station to track improvements. The programs include structured training blocks, performance tracking, and the ability to target individual station weaknesses. LEVLS is app-based and represents the closest thing to an "official Hyrox program."

**Endur** — Partnered with Hyrox World Champion Alexander Roncevic, offering step-by-step audio and video coaching for Open and Pro categories.

**Relentless Method** — Offers personalized Hyrox training with AI adaptation, adjusting to athlete ability, equipment, and schedule. Athletes choose between fitness-focused or race-intense plans.

**Centr** — Chris Hemsworth's platform became an official Hyrox partner offering certified race-specific programs integrated with nutrition, recovery, and mindset coaching. It's a holistic platform but more generalist than specialized (ChAIron.app analysis, 2025).

### 2.2 Hyrox Academy & Master Trainer Ecosystem

Hyrox has developed a multi-level education and certification system through the **Hyrox Academy** (documented on roxlyfe.com/hyrox-365):
- **HYROX Foundation Course** ("Get Race Ready") — Entry-level certification for coaches
- **Level 1–4 Education Courses** — Progressive qualification covering periodization, biomechanics, nutrition, business strategy, and race development
- These certifications create "HYROX Performance Coaches" who implement the Hyrox methodology in gyms worldwide

The Hyrox Academy covers all aspects of athlete and performance development and is "written by industry and science-backed experts, all delivered through an innovative LMS system" (Roxlyfe, 2024). This ecosystem is important for AI coaches to understand because it establishes standardized coaching principles for the sport.

### 2.3 HAOS Training (Hunter McIntyre's Platform)

HAOS (Hunter's Academy of Strength) is built by multiple-time OCR World Champion Hunter McIntyre, who holds the Hyrox world record and MURPH world record. Key details (hyroxtrainingplans.com):

- **Price**: $39.99/month
- **Structure**: 6 days/week, ~100 min/session, 10 hours/week total commitment
- **Four Progressive Programs**: Intro Athlete → Strength → Run → Pro
- **Cycle Length**: 8–12 weeks per program phase
- **Philosophy**: A "proven yearly periodization model that maximizes agility, allowing you to build strength and endurance so you can quickly reach peak performance for any event" (pro.haostraining.com)
- **Key Differentiator**: HAOS trains for multiple racing disciplines (Spartan, Hyrox, CrossFit, Trail Running) and emphasizes the ability to pivot between sports — a generalist-specialist hybrid approach

HAOS also offers 1-on-1 coaching through Hunter McIntyre and Parker Gregory for athletes wanting individualized programming.

**AI Coach Takeaway**: HAOS's four-level progressive structure is an excellent template for an AI system — athletes self-select their level and advance systematically. The yearly periodization model that accommodates multiple race types is particularly valuable for athletes who compete in Hyrox seasonally.

### 2.4 Roxlyfe

Roxlyfe offers a popular **12-Week Hyrox Training Plan** (roxlyfe.com/12-week-training-plan/) with extensive user testimonials. Key features:
- **Multi-level scaling**: Workouts include difficulty levels so athletes can progress within the plan
- **Weekly Hyrox simulation**: One dedicated session per week mimics race conditions — a major confidence builder
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Runs of varying speeds/lengths, interval training, strength work, and Hyrox-specific simulations
- **Accessible price point**: Designed for non-professional athletes
- **Results**: Users report improvements of 3:30–5:30+ on race times, with personal bests across multiple stations

One testimonial captures the plan's appeal: "The Rox Lyfe program was everything I was looking for in a hybrid training program — thoughtful, comprehensive, challenging, and accessible to non-professional athletes" (Roxlyfe testimonials, 2025).

### 2.5 Other Notable Hyrox-Specific Programs

- **RMR Training** (rmr.training): Offers a 12-week flagship Hyrox program with native leaderboards, long-form video guidance, and community features. Host Rich Ryan's podcast covers structured programming for Hyrox including progressive overload, aerobic work, strength, and rest management.
- **ChAIron**: AI-powered training app claiming 30–40% improved race-day pacing accuracy through real-time form feedback and adaptive difficulty (ChAIron, 2025). Represents the frontier of AI coaching for Hyrox.
- **PRVN HYROX**: Tia-Clair Toomey and Shane Orr's PRVN has launched a dedicated Hyrox track with daily programming, 8-week cycles, race-day prep programs, and scaling options for all levels. Coached by James Kelly. Priced at $45/month.
- **HWPO HYROX**: Mat Fraser's HWPO offers a Hyrox prep track (5x/week standalone or 2x/week layered with other training), included with HWPO All Access membership. Sessions average ~60 minutes.

**AI Coach Takeaway**: The most successful Hyrox programs share these DNA traits: (1) structured periodization in 8–12 week blocks, (2) weekly race simulation sessions, (3) scalable difficulty levels, (4) integration of running and station work, and (5) progressive benchmarking. An AI coach should embed all five.

## 3. Running Programs for Hybrid Athletes

### 3.1 The 80/20 Running Principle (Matt Fitzgerald)

Matt Fitzgerald's *80/20 Running* (2014) synthesizes decades of exercise science into one actionable framework: **80% of training volume should be at low intensity (Zone 1–2), and only 20% at moderate-to-high intensity (Zone 3–5)**. This "polarized training" model, pioneered by exercise physiologist Dr. Stephen Seiler, is supported by robust evidence:

- **Seiler & Kjerland (2006)**: World and Olympic Champion endurance athletes spend approximately 75–80% of training time at low intensity, despite racing at much higher intensities.
- **Helgerud et al. (2007)**: 4×4-minute intervals at 90–95% max HR produced **10.8% VO₂ max improvement** vs. only 3.5% for long slow distance — nearly 3× the improvement.
- **Stöggl & Sperlich (2014)**: After 9 weeks, the polarized group showed superior improvements in 10k time trial, VO₂ max, running economy, AND lactate threshold vs. threshold-only training. The threshold group actually declined in some metrics.

Source: HyroxDataLab.com, *"How to Structure Your HYROX Running Training"* (2025), which provides an excellent evidence-based summary with full citations.

### 3.2 Applying 80/20 to a Hyrox Athlete at 35–40 MPW

A Hyrox athlete running 35–40 miles per week (a serious but achievable volume for competitive racers) would distribute approximately:

- **28–32 miles in Zone 2** (easy, conversational pace — 60–70% max HR)
- **7–8 miles in Zone 4–5** (tempo and interval work — 75–95% max HR)

This volume is higher than most Hyrox programs prescribe (most recommend 3–4 runs/week totaling 15–25 miles). Athletes at this mileage are likely targeting sub-60 or sub-55 minute Hyrox times where running split optimization becomes the primary performance lever.

### 3.3 Sample Week Structure for a Hybrid Athlete (35–40 MPW)

| Day | Running Session | Hyrox / Strength | Total Running |
|-----|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Monday** | Easy Run, 6 mi (Zone 2) | — | 6 mi |
| **Tuesday** | Easy Run, 5 mi (Zone 2) | PM: Hyrox Station Work (sled, row, wall balls) | 5 mi |
| **Wednesday** | Tempo Run, 7 mi (2 mi warm-up, 3 mi tempo @ 75–85% HR, 2 mi cooldown) | — | 7 mi |
| **Thursday** | Recovery Run, 4 mi (Zone 1) | PM: Strength (squat, deadlift, press) | 4 mi |
| **Friday** | Intervals, 6 mi total (2 mi warm-up, 5×4 min @ 90–95% HR w/3 min jog, 2 mi cooldown) | — | 6 mi |
| **Saturday** | Easy Run, 5 mi (Zone 2) | Hyrox Race Simulation (compromised running + stations) | 5 mi |
| **Sunday** | Long Run, 8–10 mi (Zone 2) | — | 8–10 mi |
| **Weekly Total** | | | **~39–43 mi** |

**Key principles**: Easy days are truly easy. Hard days (Wednesday tempo, Friday intervals) are genuinely hard. Station work is placed on separate days or in PM sessions to allow morning running quality. The long run builds aerobic infrastructure. The Saturday simulation teaches compromised running (running immediately after heavy station work).

### 3.4 Polarized Training Model for Hybrid Athletes

The challenge for hybrid athletes doing both running and Hyrox station work is that **station work IS high-intensity training**. A heavy sled push session or a 100-rep wall ball set imposes significant physiological stress. This means:

- Station work days should be counted in the "20% hard" bucket
- Easy running days must be deliberately slow to compensate
- Total training stress (running + lifting + stations) must be managed holistically
- An athlete doing 3 hard station sessions plus 2 hard runs is at 5 high-intensity sessions/week — almost certainly too much

The practical recommendation from Hyrox Data Lab (2025) is: **3 running sessions + 2 Hyrox strength sessions per week**, with one of the three runs being Zone 2, one tempo, and one intervals. This represents a polarized approach where the 80% easy work comes from Zone 2 running and recovery days, while the 20% hard comes from tempo runs, intervals, AND station work combined.

### 3.5 Key Running Workouts Every Hyrox Athlete Should Do

**1. Zone 2 Long Run (60–90 minutes)**
- The aerobic engine builder. Increases mitochondrial density, improves fat oxidation (preserving glycogen for stations), and builds capillary networks.
- Progression: Add 5–10 min every 2–3 weeks until reaching 90 min. Don't exceed 90 min — this isn't marathon training.
- Practice race nutrition during long runs.

**2. Tempo Run (20–40 minutes at 75–85% max HR)**
- Raises lactate threshold and teaches the body to sustain "comfortably hard" effort. This pace approximates the average Hyrox running pace between stations.
- Should feel hard but sustainable — "short sentences only" on the talk test.

**3. VO₂ Max Intervals (4–8 × 3–4 min at 90–95% max HR)**
- The research-backed "magic protocol": 4×4 minutes at 90–95% max HR with 3-min active recovery (Helgerud et al., 2007).
- Maximizes VO₂ max — the ceiling that determines performance under extreme fatigue in late-race stations.

**4. Easy Runs (30–50 minutes, Zone 1–2)**
- Recovery runs that accumulate volume without adding stress. These are the "80%" that makes the "20%" possible.
- Common mistake: running these too hard. If you can't hold a full conversation, slow down.

**5. Compromised Running (Hyrox-specific)**
- Running immediately after station work (e.g., 50m sled push → immediate 1 km run).
- Teaches pacing under peripheral and central fatigue — the unique skill Hyrox demands that no pure running program addresses.
- Fraser structures this as: "800m run → row → 800m run → rest → 800m run → ski erg → 800m run" (BoxLife Magazine, 2025).

**AI Coach Takeaway**: Steal the 80/20 distribution as the governing principle for total training load. Implement Zone 2 running as non-negotiable daily programming for aerobic base. Use the 4×4 interval protocol for VO₂ max development. Most importantly, introduce "compromised running" as a Hyrox-specific training modality that pure running programs miss entirely.

## 4. COMPARISON MATRIX: All Programs Analyzed

This is the critical synthesis deliverable. The matrix below evaluates each program across standardized dimensions relevant to Hyrox race preparation.

### 4.1 Full Comparison Table

| Program | Focus Area | Sessions/Week | Conditioning Style | Strength Method | Running Component | Hyrox Readiness (1–10) | Best For |
|---------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------|
| **PRVN (CrossFit Track)** | General physical preparedness via CrossFit methodology; strength + conditioning | 5–6 | Mixed-modal metcons, AMRAPs, EMOMs, chippers; broad time domains (5–35 min) | Systematic barbell cycles (squat, deadlift, press, Olympic lifts); progressive overload across 8-week cycles | Limited within WODs (200–800m runs); not programmed as dedicated sessions | **5/10** — Elite GPP base and movement familiarity, but lacks dedicated running volume, station-specific work, and Hyrox pacing practice | CrossFit competitors wanting broad fitness; athletes using it as a GPP base who will add Hyrox-specific layers |
| **PRVN (Hyrox Track)** | Hyrox-specific: sled power, carry strength, run durability, station efficiency | 5–7 (daily programming) | Race-focused: run intervals, sled work, rowing, ski erg, wall balls; 8-week structured cycles | Integrated functional strength for carry/sled/lunge capacity; less pure barbell focus than CrossFit track | Run intervals and tempo sessions built into programming; more running than CrossFit track | **8/10** — Purpose-built by Toomey/Orr/Kelly; structured cycles, scaling options, race-day prep. Missing only ultra-high running volume for sub-55 athletes | Dedicated Hyrox competitors at all levels; CrossFit athletes transitioning to Hyrox |
| **HWPO Flagship** | Elite CrossFit performance; strength, Oly lifting, rowing, conditioning | 5 + 1 active recovery + 1 rest | Metcons (12–20 min), EMOM work, dedicated rowing/bike erg pieces; interval-based with forced breaks | Heavy: squat 2×/wk, deadlift 1×/wk, bench 1×/wk, Oly lifts 3×/wk; percentage-based progressive cycles | Minimal — running appears within WODs but no structured running program | **4/10** — Builds massive work capacity, rowing endurance, and mental toughness. But sessions are 1:45–2:00 hrs, running is neglected, and Hyrox-specific stations aren't trained. Overkill on Oly lifting. | CrossFit competitors and advanced fitness enthusiasts wanting Fraser-level programming intensity |
| **HWPO Hyrox** | Hyrox race preparation layered onto HWPO base | 5×/wk standalone OR 2×/wk add-on | Hyrox-specific conditioning: race simulation, station work, compromised cardio | Functional strength oriented toward Hyrox station demands | Integrated — running is central to the programming; Fraser explicitly prioritizes running ("Priority one") | **7/10** — Leverages Fraser's elite programming mind for Hyrox specifics. Available as add-on (flexible). But newer program; less track record than established Hyrox platforms. ~60 min sessions are efficient. | HWPO members wanting Hyrox prep; CrossFit athletes with limited time for a second program |
| **CompTrain** | Sustainable general fitness; accessible CrossFit programming for gym classes | 6 (Mon–Sat) | Balanced: 8–18 min conditioning + strength days, 20–35 min longer conditioning days, team workouts Saturday | Weekly: press, pull (deadlift), squat; biannual benchmark testing (24 WODs/year) | **Running 2–3×/week** at varying intensities/distances — a standout among CrossFit programs | **5/10** — Best pure CrossFit program for running integration. Sustainable intensity model. But no Hyrox-specific station work, race simulation, or periodization toward a Hyrox event. | Gym owners/members wanting quality group programming; athletes who want running-inclusive CrossFit |
| **Persist (Marcus Filly)** | Functional bodybuilding: hypertrophy + mobility + controlled conditioning | 4–5 | Conditioning finishers (EMOMs, AMRAPs, burnout sets); not the primary focus. Perform track = 90-min sessions with more conditioning | Progressive overload across squat, bench, deadlift, press; tempo work, controlled eccentrics, range-of-motion emphasis; 6-week cycles | Essentially none — running is not programmed | **2/10** — Excellent for building muscular endurance, mobility, and structural balance. But almost zero conditioning transfer, no running, no Hyrox-specific work. Useful only as a supplementary hypertrophy program. | Athletes needing to build muscle mass, improve movement quality, or recover from injury while maintaining training |
| **Nick Bare Hybrid Athlete** | Running + lifting for "optimal health, performance, and longevity" | 7 (5 lifting + 5 running + 2 mobility; most days = two-a-days) | Minimal structured conditioning; the "conditioning" comes from high running volume + lifting density | Hypertrophy-focused: push/pull/lower body split; bodybuilding exercise selection (not functional movements) | **Extensive**: 5 runs/week including easy runs, intervals, threshold runs, and weekly long run; ~5 mi/day minimum | **5/10** — Outstanding running volume and endurance base. But strength programming is bodybuilding, not functional (no sleds, carries, wall balls). No race simulation. Requires extreme time commitment (two-a-days). | Endurance-curious lifters who want to run marathons/halfs while maintaining muscle; NOT optimized for Hyrox-specific demands |
| **CrossFit Mainsite** | Broad GPP; "unknown and unknowable" preparedness | 5–6 | Maximum variance: every WOD format (AMRAP, For Time, EMOM, chipper, Tabata); time domains from 3–40+ min | Embedded in WODs — heavy days for squat, deadlift, press, clean, snatch; no structured linear progression | Occasional 400m–1600m runs within WODs; no dedicated running program | **4/10** — Builds incredible general fitness and movement competency across all Hyrox stations. But zero running specificity, no periodization, no Hyrox race simulation. Great starting point; insufficient for serious competitors. | General fitness enthusiasts; athletes wanting to "show up and see what happens" at their first Hyrox |
| **80/20 Running (Fitzgerald)** | Endurance running performance via polarized intensity distribution | 3–6 running sessions | Polarized: 80% Zone 2, ~5% tempo, ~15% VO₂ max intervals; no functional conditioning | None — purely a running methodology | **Comprehensive**: long runs, tempo runs, VO₂ max intervals, easy runs; scalable from 20–60+ MPW | **3/10** — Provides the optimal running methodology for Hyrox but offers zero strength, conditioning, or station work. An AI coach should use 80/20 as the RUNNING ENGINE within a broader Hyrox program, not as a standalone solution. | Pure runners adding Hyrox to their race calendar; providing the running philosophy layer for any Hyrox program |
| **HAOS (Hunter McIntyre)** | Multi-sport hybrid racing (Hyrox, OCR, CrossFit, trail) | 5–6 | Race-specific: strength + running combined; progressive from intro to pro-level; yearly periodization | Functional strength built into program progression; carries, sleds, bodyweight; builds from foundation to sport-specific | Running is a core pillar (dedicated "Run" program phase); speed, endurance, and running efficiency | **7/10** — Created by one of the sport's greatest competitors; proven periodization model. Four-level system is elegant. But generalist approach (covers OCR, CrossFit, trail) means Hyrox isn't the sole focus. $40/mo for non-individualized programming. | Multi-sport athletes who race Hyrox alongside OCR or other events; athletes wanting a structured yearly plan |
| **Roxlyfe 12-Week Plan** | Hyrox race preparation for amateur/intermediate athletes | 5–6 | Hyrox-specific: runs, intervals, strength, weekly race simulations; scalable difficulty levels | Functional strength for station demands; progressive over 12 weeks | Progressive running: varying speeds/lengths, interval work, tempo sessions | **7/10** — Exceptional user testimonials (3:30–5:30 improvements). Affordable, well-structured, and specifically designed for Hyrox. Scaling options for all levels. But static program (no AI adaptation) and limited post-race ongoing programming. | First-time or intermediate Hyrox athletes wanting a proven, affordable 12-week prep plan |
| **LEVLS (Official Hyrox Partner)** | Hyrox race preparation and daily hybrid fitness | 5–6 | Progressive methodology with benchmark workouts at all 8 stations; structured training blocks | Functional strength targeting station-specific demands | Integrated running as part of Hyrox race preparation | **8/10** — Official Hyrox partnership provides credibility and direct alignment with race standards. Progressive benchmarking at each station is powerful for tracking. Pre-set routines lack real-time adaptation. | Athletes wanting the "official" Hyrox training experience; those who value structured, methodology-driven programming |

### 4.2 Hyrox Readiness Score Justifications

| Program | Score | Justification |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| **PRVN CrossFit** | 5/10 | Builds elite general fitness and all movement competencies, but lacks Hyrox-specific running volume, station practice, and race pacing strategy. CrossFit athletes do well at Hyrox "off the couch" (top third), but can't compete for podiums without supplementation. |
| **PRVN Hyrox** | 8/10 | Purpose-built by the world's most decorated CrossFit athlete (Toomey) and a top Hyrox specialist (Kelly); offers structured cycles, daily programming, race-day prep, and multi-level scaling. Only misses the ultra-high running volume needed for elite sub-55 times. |
| **HWPO Flagship** | 4/10 | Massive work capacity builder with elite-level barbell strength and rowing endurance, but sessions are too long (1:45–2 hrs), running is almost absent, and Olympic lifting emphasis is misallocated for Hyrox demands. |
| **HWPO Hyrox** | 7/10 | Fraser's programming expertise applied to Hyrox with running as declared priority. Flexible (2x or 5x/week). But relatively new program with less proven track record than dedicated Hyrox platforms; relies on Fraser's CrossFit background more than Hyrox-specific race experience. |
| **CompTrain** | 5/10 | Uniquely among CrossFit programs, emphasizes running 2–3×/week and sustainable intensity ("build up, not burn out"). But designed for gym classes, not individual Hyrox prep; no station-specific work or race simulation. |
| **Persist** | 2/10 | Exceptional for structural balance, hypertrophy, and mobility, but essentially zero transfer to Hyrox conditioning demands. No running, no sleds, no race simulation. Only useful as a supplementary off-season hypertrophy block. |
| **Nick Bare Hybrid** | 5/10 | Outstanding running volume (5 runs/wk, ~25–35 mi) that would build an excellent aerobic base for Hyrox. But the strength side is bodybuilding (not functional), there's no station work, and the two-a-day structure is unsustainable for most. |
| **CrossFit Mainsite** | 4/10 | Maximum variance builds readiness for anything, including Hyrox — but the lack of specificity means it's a great foundation that must be supplemented. No running program, no periodization, no race-day strategy. |
| **80/20 Running** | 3/10 | Provides the scientifically optimal running methodology, but running alone is only ~50% of Hyrox. Zero strength, zero station work, zero race simulation. Essential as a COMPONENT of a Hyrox program, not a standalone solution. |
| **HAOS** | 7/10 | World-record-holder's proven system with elegant 4-level progression and yearly periodization. Covers strength, running, and race prep. Loses a point for being multi-sport (not Hyrox-exclusive) and for being non-adaptive (same programming for all users). |
| **Roxlyfe** | 7/10 | Proven 12-week plan with exceptional user results and accessible scaling. Weekly race simulations are a standout feature. Loses points for being a static plan with no ongoing programming post-race and no AI adaptation. |
| **LEVLS** | 8/10 | Official Hyrox partnership ensures alignment with race standards and station benchmarks. Progressive methodology with structured blocks. Pre-set routines lack adaptive personalization, but the Hyrox-specific benchmarking system is best-in-class. |

## 5. What an AI Coaching System Should Steal from Each Program

### From CrossFit Programming (Mainsite / CompTrain)
- **Steal**: The WOD format library (AMRAP, EMOM, For Time, Chipper) as templates for Hyrox conditioning sessions
- **Steal**: CompTrain's principle of "intentional intensity" — programming movement pairings, loading, and rep schemes that fall into a "sweet spot for sustainable power output"
- **Steal**: The scaling methodology — offering Rx'd, scaled, and beginner versions of every workout so the AI can serve athletes at any level
- **Steal**: CompTrain's 24 benchmark workouts/year framework — create Hyrox-specific benchmarks (e.g., "1km row + 1km run for time") that repeat bimonthly for progress tracking

### From PRVN
- **Steal**: The 8-week cycle structure with built-in periodization — this is the optimal block length for Hyrox preparation
- **Steal**: The concept of having both a "base" (CrossFit/GPP) track and a "Hyrox-specific" track that athletes can switch between depending on proximity to race day
- **Steal**: Multi-level scaling (Level 1 through Level 3+) so the AI can auto-assign difficulty based on assessment data

### From HWPO
- **Steal**: Fraser's percentage-based strength programming — every working set prescribed as % of 1RM removes guesswork
- **Steal**: The "forced break" interval format — 4×2-min AMRAPs with 1-min rest — which increases actual intensity vs. long unbroken AMRAPs
- **Steal**: The sequential day numbering system (Day 1, Day 100, Day 400) which ensures progressive onboarding regardless of when an athlete starts

### From HAOS (Hunter McIntyre)
- **Steal**: The four-level progressive system (Intro → Strength → Run → Pro) as a user journey template
- **Steal**: The yearly periodization model that peaks athletes for specific races while maintaining year-round readiness
- **Steal**: The dual focus on strength AND running as co-equal pillars, not running bolted onto a strength program

### From 80/20 Running (Fitzgerald)
- **Steal**: The 80/20 intensity distribution as the GOVERNING PRINCIPLE for total training load (including station work in the "hard" bucket)
- **Steal**: The three-run-per-week framework: Zone 2 long run, tempo run, VO₂ max intervals — as the minimum effective running dose
- **Steal**: Heart rate zone training as the primary pacing metric, with clear zone definitions and talk-test fallbacks

### From Nick Bare Hybrid Athlete
- **Steal**: The two-a-day structure option (AM running / PM lifting) for athletes with time availability — the AI should offer this as an advanced mode
- **Steal**: The concept of running EVERY training day (even if just 3–5 easy miles) to accumulate aerobic volume without adding separate sessions
- **Steal**: Dedicated mobility days as programmed, non-negotiable sessions — not afterthoughts

### From Persist (Marcus Filly)
- **Steal**: Tempo-controlled lifting (e.g., 3-second eccentric squats) for building muscular endurance and joint resilience — directly applicable to sandbag lunges and farmer's carry
- **Steal**: The "warm-up as training" philosophy where warm-ups include loaded movements that build toward the day's work
- **Steal**: 6-week cycle length for hypertrophy/structural balance blocks in the off-season

### From Hyrox-Specific Programs (LEVLS, Roxlyfe, RMR)
- **Steal**: Weekly race simulation sessions — the single most Hyrox-specific training modality that no CrossFit or running program offers
- **Steal**: Station-specific benchmarking (e.g., time your 50m sled push, 1000m row, 100 wall balls independently) to identify and target weaknesses
- **Steal**: The "compromised running" concept — deliberately running immediately after heavy station work to train the specific skill of pacing under fatigue
- **Steal**: Progressive running integration where running volume and intensity increase as race day approaches while pure strength volume decreases (CrossFit.com's 12-week Hyrox prep model: full CrossFit → reduced CF + increased specificity → taper)

## 6. Synthesis: The Ideal AI Coaching Architecture

Based on this analysis, the optimal AI coaching system for Hyrox preparation should integrate:

1. **Running Engine**: 80/20 polarized model with 3–5 runs/week, auto-adjusting volume based on race proximity and athlete level (inspired by Fitzgerald, Hyrox Data Lab)
2. **Strength Foundation**: Percentage-based functional strength programming in 6–8 week cycles (inspired by HWPO, PRVN, Persist)
3. **Station-Specific Training**: Weekly rotation through all 8 Hyrox stations with benchmark tracking (inspired by LEVLS, Roxlyfe)
4. **Race Simulation**: Weekly chipper-style sessions mimicking full or partial Hyrox race conditions (inspired by Roxlyfe, PRVN Hyrox, CrossFit chipper WODs)
5. **Conditioning Variety**: CrossFit WOD formats (EMOM, AMRAP, For Time) used as templates for metabolic conditioning sessions (inspired by CompTrain, CrossFit Mainsite)
6. **Progressive System**: Multi-level athlete pathway from beginner to elite with auto-scaling (inspired by HAOS's 4-level system, PRVN's 3-level Compete)
7. **Periodization**: Year-round programming with 8–12 week race-prep blocks that peak for specific events (inspired by HAOS yearly model, PRVN cycles)
8. **Pacing Intelligence**: Zone-based training with HR monitoring, enforced easy days, and race-pace calibration (inspired by 80/20, Hyrox Data Lab's anti-gray-zone philosophy)

No single existing program scores a 10/10. The programs that come closest — PRVN Hyrox (8/10) and LEVLS (8/10) — still lack adaptive personalization and ultra-high running volume options. The opportunity for an AI coaching system is to synthesize the best elements from all programs into a truly personalized, adaptive Hyrox preparation experience.

## Original Prompt

```
You are a research analyst evaluating training programs and methodologies for their applicability to Hyrox race preparation. This research will power an AI coaching system.

Analyze these programs/methodologies AND produce a final comparison matrix:

## 1. CrossFit Programming Principles
- CrossFit.com mainsite programming methodology
- "Constantly varied, high-intensity, functional movement" — how this applies to Hyrox
- Typical CrossFit class structure (warm-up, strength, WOD, cooldown)
- Common WOD formats: AMRAP, For Time, EMOM, Chipper, Tabata
- 3-5 classic CrossFit workouts that would transfer well to Hyrox preparation
- What CrossFit programming gets RIGHT for Hyrox (work capacity, metabolic conditioning, mental toughness)
- What CrossFit programming MISSES for Hyrox (running volume, specific station work, pacing)

## 2. Hyrox Official Training Programs
- Does Hyrox offer an official training app or program? If so, analyze it.
- Hyrox-branded training plans (if available through hyrox.com or partners)
- Hyrox Master Trainer recommendations
- HAOS Training (Hunter McIntyre's platform) — briefly, as this overlaps Team 2
- Any other Hyrox-specific commercial programs (Roxlyfe, etc.)

## 3. Running Programs for Hybrid Athletes
- 80/20 Running (Matt Fitzgerald): the 80% easy / 20% hard principle
  - How this applies to a Hyrox athlete who needs to maintain 35-40 mpw
  - Sample week structure for a hybrid athlete
- Polarized training model for runners who also do strength/HIIT
- How to integrate running programming with Hyrox station work
- Key running workouts every Hyrox athlete should do: tempo runs, intervals, long runs, easy runs

## 4. COMPARISON MATRIX (Critical — this synthesizes all Team 3 research)

Create a comprehensive markdown table comparing ALL programs analyzed across Teams 3a, 3b, and 3c:

| Program | Focus Area | Sessions/Week | Conditioning Style | Strength Method | Running Component | Hyrox Readiness (1-10) | Best For |
|---------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------|

Include: PRVN, HWPO, CompTrain, Persist, Nick Bare Hybrid, CrossFit, Hyrox Official, 80/20 Running

For the Hyrox Readiness score, provide a 1-2 sentence justification for each rating.

IMPORTANT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Length: At minimum 3,000 words.
- Format: Use structured markdown with H2/H3 headers and markdown tables.
- The comparison matrix is the most important deliverable — make it comprehensive.
- Be specific about what an AI coach should steal from each program's methodology.
- Cite sources: websites, books, podcast episodes, athlete content.
```
