## 1. Macro-Level Periodization Structure

### 1.1 Phase Overview

| Phase | Weeks | Dates | Primary Goal | Running Volume | Strength Sessions | HIIT/Hyrox Sessions | Hyrox Simulations |
|-------|-------|-------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Phase 1: General Prep** | 1–4 | Feb 17 – Mar 16 | Build aerobic engine, introduce Hyrox movements, establish baseline benchmarks | 35–38 mpw | 2/week | 2/week | 0 (benchmark testing only) |
| **Phase 2: Specific Prep** | 5–8 | Mar 17 – Apr 13 | Develop station-specific capacity, increase HIIT density, introduce compromised running | 36–40 mpw | 2/week | 3/week | 1 (half-sim in Week 8) |
| **Phase 3: Competition Prep** | 9–12 | Apr 14 – May 11 | Race-pace simulation, pacing discipline, peak HIIT complexity, refine weaknesses | 35–38 mpw | 1–2/week | 3/week | 2 (Weeks 10, 12) |
| **Phase 4: Taper & Peak** | 13–16 | May 12 – Jun 6 | Reduce volume, maintain intensity, sharpen race-day execution, mental prep | 28–32 mpw (↓20–25%) | 1/week | 2/week (reduced volume) | 1 (Week 14, dress rehearsal) |

### 1.2 Deload Weeks

Every 4th week is a **deload week** (Weeks 4, 8, 12). During deload:
- Running volume drops 20–25%
- HIIT session count drops from 3 → 2, with reduced volume per session (cut sets by 30–40%)
- Strength intensity maintained at 85–90% of working loads but volume halved (2 sets instead of 4)
- No race simulations during deload
- Add one extra rest or active recovery day

Week 16 is the final taper/race week — treated as a super-deload.

**Target time:** 32–40 min. First km: 4:40–4:50. Final km: 4:50–5:00 (allow 10 sec drift).

---

### HIIT #17 — Taper Sharpener EMOM (Phase 4)
**Format:** EMOM 15  
**Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Target:** Race-weight touchpoints at reduced volume; neural activation, not fatigue

| Minute | Movement | Prescription |

| Min 3 | Row | 12 cal |
| Min 4 | Sandbag Lunges | 15 m @ 20 kg |
| Min 5 | Rest | Walk, shake out |
| Repeat 3 rounds |||

**Intensity:** RPE 6–7. This should feel "comfortable-hard" — practiced, controlled, smooth.  
**Scaling:** Not applicable — this is already reduced volume. Advanced athletes may increase to 15 cal / 15 reps / 20 m.

---

### HIIT #18 — AMRAP 20: Hyrox Engine Test (Phase 2/3)
**Format:** 20-Minute AMRAP

## 4. Hyrox Simulation Workouts

### Simulation #1 — Baseline Benchmark (Week 4 Deload)
**Format:** Partial Simulation — 4 stations + 4 km running  
**When:** Saturday of Week 4  
**Duration:** 35–50 min  
**Purpose:** Establish baseline times for all stations and running

| Segment | Prescription | Record |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Run 1 | 1 km | Split time |
| SkiErg | 1,000 m | Station time |
| Run 2 | 1 km | Split time |
| Sled Push | 50 m @ 100% race weight (152 kg) | Station time |
| Run 3 | 1 km | Split time |
| Row | 1,000 m | Station time |
| Run 4 | 1 km | Split time |
| Wall Balls | 100 reps @ 6 kg to 10 ft | Station time |

**Notes:** Record total time AND individual segment times. This is your benchmark against which all future progress is measured. Pace runs at goal race pace. Go 85% effort on stations — save 100% for the actual race.

---

### Simulation #2 — Half-Simulation (Week 8 Deload)
**Format:** Stations 1–4 + 4 km running (first half of race)  
**When:** Saturday of Week 8  
**Duration:** 30–42 min

| Segment | Prescription |
|---------|-------------|
| Run 1 → SkiErg 1,000 m → Run 2 → Sled Push 50 m @ 152 kg → Run 3 → Sled Pull 50 m @ 103 kg → Run 4 → BBJ 80 m |

**Purpose:** Test first-half race execution. Track all splits. Compare Run 1 vs. Run 4 pace degradation (target: <15 sec/km drift). Compare station times to Week 4 benchmark.

---

### Simulation #3 — Full Simulation (Week 10)
**Format:** Full 8-station Hyrox simulation  
**When:** Saturday of Week 10  
**Duration:** 65–85 min  
**Purpose:** Complete race dress rehearsal. This is the highest-volume simulation of the entire plan.

| Segment | Prescription | Target Time |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Run 1 (1 km) | @ 4:40/km | 4:40 |
| SkiErg 1,000 m | @ 1:55/500m | 3:50 |
| Run 2 (1 km) | @ 4:40/km | 4:40 |
| Sled Push 50 m | @ 152 kg, continuous | 2:50 |
| Run 3 (1 km) | @ 4:45/km | 4:45 |
| Sled Pull 50 m | @ 103 kg | 3:30 |
| Run 4 (1 km) | @ 4:45/km | 4:45 |
| BBJ 80 m | Step-up, steady | 3:30 |
| Run 5 (1 km) | @ 4:50/km | 4:50 |
| Row 1,000 m | @ 1:55/500m | 3:50 |
| Run 6 (1 km) | @ 4:50/km | 4:50 |
| Farmers Carry 200 m | @ 2×24 kg | 1:45 |
| Run 7 (1 km) | @ 4:50/km | 4:50 |
| Sandbag Lunges 100 m | @ 20 kg | 4:30 |
| Run 8 (1 km) | @ 4:55/km | 4:55 |
| Wall Balls 100 reps | @ 6 kg, 4×25 | 5:30 |

**Total target: ~68–72 min.** Record everything. This is your predicted race time ± 3–5 min (race-day adrenaline and fresh legs may improve by 3–5%).

**Nutrition practice:** Use race-day nutrition during this simulation — test gels, electrolytes, timing. Take a gel between Station 4 (BBJ) and Run 5.

---

### Simulation #4 — Three-Quarter Simulation (Week 12 Deload)
**Format:** Stations 4–8 + 5 runs (second half emphasis)  
**When:** Saturday of Week 12  
**Duration:** 40–55 min

| Segment | Prescription |
|---------|-------------|
| Run → BBJ 80 m → Run → Row 1,000 m → Run → Farmers Carry 200 m → Run → Sandbag Lunges 100 m → Run → Wall Balls 100 reps |

**Purpose:** The second half of the race is where most time is lost. This simulation specifically trains the lunge → wall ball connection (r = 0.738 correlation per HyroxDataLab) and late-race running under deep fatigue.

---

### Simulation #5 — Dress Rehearsal: Half-Simulation (Week 14)
**Format:** Abbreviated race rehearsal — 4 stations, 4 km, reduced intensity  
**When:** Thursday of Week 14  
**Duration:** 30–40 min

| Segment | Prescription |
|---------|-------------|
| Run 1 km → SkiErg 750 m → Run 1 km → Sled Push 25 m @ 152 kg → Run 1 km → Wall Balls 50 reps → Run 1 km |

**Purpose:** Final confidence-builder. Reduced volume but full race weight. Practice pacing, transitions, nutrition timing, and mental routine. Should feel EASY — RPE 6–7 max. If it doesn't feel easy, the taper is working.

---

### Simulation Deployment Schedule Summary

## 5. Progressive Overload Strategy

### 5.1 Running Progression

| Variable | Phase 1 (Wk 1–4) | Phase 2 (Wk 5–8) | Phase 3 (Wk 9–12) | Phase 4 (Wk 13–16) |
|----------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Weekly mileage | 35–38 mi | 36–40 mi | 35–38 mi | 28–15 mi (↓) |
| Long run distance | 10 mi | 11 mi | 10 mi | 8 → 6 → 0 mi |
| Tempo run distance | 3 mi @ threshold | 3–4 mi @ threshold | 4 mi @ race pace | 2 mi @ race pace |
| VO₂max intervals | 4×4 min | 4×4 min | 5×4 min or 6×3 min | 3×4 min → 0 |
| Compromised runs | 0 | 1/week (2.5 mi post-strength) | 2/week (within HIIT sessions) | 1/week (within reduced HIIT) |
| Easy run pace | 8:00–8:30/mi | 8:00–8:30/mi | 8:00–8:30/mi | 8:00–8:30/mi |
| Goal race pace target | 7:15–7:30/mi (4:30–4:40/km) | 7:05–7:20/mi (4:25–4:35/km) | 7:00–7:15/mi (4:20–4:30/km) | Maintain Phase 3 pace |

**Progression logic:** Mileage builds 5–8% per 3-week block then drops 20–25% on deload week. Intensity (tempo/interval pace) improves as aerobic base adapts. Compromised running is added in Phase 2 and increased in Phase 3 because the ability to run well under station fatigue is the single most trainable Hyrox limiter.

### 5.2 Station-Specific Progression

| Station | Phase 1 Load/Volume | Phase 2 | Phase 3 | Phase 4 |
|---------|-------------------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Sled Push** | 122 kg (80%), 2×50m per session | 137 kg (90%), 4×50m | 152 kg (100%), 4×50m | 152 kg, 2×50m (reduced vol) |
| **Sled Pull** | 82 kg (80%), 2×50m | 93 kg (90%), 4×50m | 103 kg (100%), 4×50m | 103 kg, 2×50m |
| **Wall Balls** | 6 kg, sets of 15–25, total 75/session | 6 kg, sets of 25, total 100/session | 6 kg, 4×25 or unbroken 100 | 6 kg, 50 reps max |
| **BBJ** | 20–40 m per session | 40–60 m | 80 m (full race distance) | 40 m |
| **Lunges** | 20 kg, 25–50 m per session | 20 kg, 50–75 m | 20 kg, 100 m (full race distance) | 20 kg, 50 m |
| **Farmers Carry** | 2×24 kg, 50–100 m | 2×24 kg, 100–150 m | 2×24 kg, 200 m (full race distance) | 2×24 kg, 100 m |
| **SkiErg** | 500 m intervals | 750 m intervals | 1,000 m (full race distance) | 500 m (maintenance) |
| **Row** | 500 m intervals | 750 m intervals | 1,000 m (full race distance) | 500 m |

**Progression logic:** Load increases linearly from 80% → 90% → 100% race weight across Phases 1–3. Volume increases alongside load (more sets, longer distances) until Phase 3 reaches full race specifications. Phase 4 maintains race-weight loads but cuts volume by ~50% to preserve freshness.

### 5.3 Strength Progression

| Phase | Squat Protocol | Deadlift Protocol | Accessory Focus | Sessions/Week |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Phase 1 | Back Squat 4×5 @ 80% → 4×4 @ 83% → 4×3 @ 85% | Deadlift 3×5 @ 78% → 3×4 @ 82% | Pull-ups, rows, RDL, walking lunges | 2 |
| Phase 2 | Front Squat 3×8 @ 72% → 3×6 @ 75% | RDL 3×8 @ 70% | DB lunges, GHD, farmer holds | 2 |
| Phase 3 | Back Squat 3×4 @ 82% (maintenance) | Deadlift 3×3 @ 85% (maintenance) | Single-leg work, core stability | 1–2 |
| Phase 4 | Back Squat 2×4 @ 78% (activation) | Deadlift 2×3 @ 75% (light) | Minimal — pull-ups 2×8, plank 2×45s | 1 |

**Progression logic:** Phase 1 follows classic 5-3-1 progression building toward high relative intensity. Phase 2 shifts to hypertrophy/strength-endurance rep ranges (6–10 reps) to support station demands. Phase 3 reverts to low-rep, moderate-load maintenance — the goal is to preserve strength without accumulating fatigue. Phase 4 is activation only.

### 5.4 HIIT Complexity & Density Progression

| Variable | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3 | Phase 4 |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Sessions/week | 2 | 3 | 3 | 2 → 1 |
| Avg session duration | 35–45 min | 45–55 min | 50–65 min | 30–40 min |
| Time domains | 10–20 min pieces | 15–25 min pieces | 20–40 min pieces | 10–15 min pieces |
| Work:rest ratios | 1:1 to 1:2 | 1:0.75 to 1:1 | 1:0.5 to 1:1 | 1:1 to 1:2 |
| Station load | 80% race weight | 90% race weight | 100% race weight | 100% load, 50% volume |
| Movements per session | 2–4 stations | 3–6 stations | 4–8 stations (full race) | 2–4 stations |
| Compromised running included | No | Yes (1/session) | Yes (2–4 km per session) | Yes (1–2 km) |

---

## 6. Taper Protocol

### 6.1 Final 14-Day Taper Strategy (Weeks 15–16)

The taper follows the evidence-based model: **reduce volume 40–60%** while **maintaining or slightly increasing intensity** on key sessions. This preserves neuromuscular readiness and aerobic fitness while allowing full glycogen resynthesis, muscle repair, and psychological freshness.

| Day (countdown) | Date | Session | Volume vs. Peak | Intensity | Notes |
|-----------------|------|---------|----------------|-----------|-------|
| Day -14 | May 23 (Fri) | Easy Run 5 mi | 60% | Zone 2 | Last "normal" easy run |
| Day -13 | May 24 (Sat) | HIIT #17 (Taper Sharpener) | 50% | RPE 7 | Reduced-volume EMOM, race-weight touch |
| Day -12 | May 25 (Sun) | Rest | 0% | — | Full rest |
| Day -11 | May 26 (Mon) | Easy Run 5 mi + Strides | 55% | Zone 2 + 4×100m strides | Neuromuscular activation |
| Day -10 | May 27 (Tue) | Strength (Light) 40 min | 40% | RPE 5–6 | 2×4 squat @ 78%, 2×6 RDL, 2×8 pull-ups |
| Day -9 | May 28 (Wed) | Interval Run (Reduced) | 50% | 3×4 min @ 90% HRmax | Last real VO₂max session |
| Day -8 | May 29 (Thu) | Rest or 20 min walk | 0% | — | Mental prep begins |
| Day -7 | May 30 (Fri) | Easy Run 4 mi | 40% | Zone 2 | Gentle shakeout |
| Day -6 | May 31 (Sat) | HIIT #20 (Race Primer EMOM) 10 min | 25% | RPE 5–6 | Neural priming only — race-weight stations at 50% volume |
| Day -5 | Jun 1 (Sun) | Rest | 0% | — | Full rest |
| Day -4 | Jun 2 (Mon) | Easy Run 3 mi + 4×80m strides | 30% | Zone 2 + strides at mile pace | Last real workout |
| Day -3 | Jun 3 (Tue) | Rest / 15-min walk | 0% | — | Optional light walk |
| Day -2 | Jun 4 (Wed) | Shakeout 2 mi + 2×30-sec pickups | 20% | Easy + 2 race-pace bursts | Neural priming, confidence builder |
| Day -1 | Jun 5 (Thu) | Rest | 0% | — | Gear prep, hydrate, carb-load, visualize |
| **Race Day** | Jun 6 (Fri) | **HYROX** | 100% | Race effort | Execute the plan |

### 6.2 What to Cut vs. Maintain

| Cut | Maintain |
|-----|---------|
| Running volume (down 40–60%) | Running intensity on 1–2 key sessions (strides, race-pace pickups) |
| HIIT session count (3/wk → 1 → 0) | Race-weight station touchpoints (short, low-volume) |
| Strength sessions (2/wk → 1 → 0) | Mobility and foam rolling (daily) |
| Long run (eliminated by Week 15) | Sleep quality (8+ hours/night, strict) |
| Session duration (drop from 60 min → 30 min → 20 min) | Nutrition quality and carb-loading protocol |
| All high-volume conditioning | Short-burst neuromuscular activation (strides, pickups) |

### 6.3 Race Day Warm-Up Protocol

**Timing:** Begin 40 minutes before wave start. Arrive at venue 70–90 minutes before start.

| Phase | Time Before Start | Duration | Activity |
|-------|------------------|----------|----------|
| 1: Aerobic Activation | T-40 min | 8 min | Light jog around venue or on BikeErg (Zone 1–2, easy) |
| 2: Dynamic Mobility | T-32 min | 5 min | Leg swings (front/back, lateral), hip circles, arm circles, ankle rolls, thoracic rotation |
| 3: Intensity Ramp | T-27 min | 8 min | 500 m SkiErg @ race pace (1:55/500m), 400 m run at goal race pace, 5 wall balls @ race weight, 3 BBJ |
| 4: Race-Pace Strides | T-19 min | 5 min | 4×100 m strides at race pace with walk-back recovery |
| 5: Station Priming | T-14 min | 4 min | If sled available: 1×12.5 m push at race weight. If not: 10 bodyweight squats, 10 push-ups, 5 broad jumps |
| 6: Mental Reset | T-10 min | 5 min | Deep breathing (4-count in, 4-hold, 6-out). Visualize first 3 stations. Review pacing targets on wrist/arm. Find your mantra. |
| 7: Assembly | T-5 min | — | Enter Start Zone. Put on timing chip. Confirm wave number matches arm marking. Controlled breathing. |

**Race-Day Pacing Targets to Write on Arm:**

| Segment | Target Time |
|---------|-------------|
| Run 1 | 4:40 (conservative start) |
| SkiErg | 3:50 |

## 1. HYROX Event Format — Complete Reference

### 1.1 Core Concept

HYROX is an indoor mass-participation fitness race combining running and functional workout stations. It was co-founded by Christian Toetzke and designed by Mintra Tilly (Director of Sport). The format is standardised worldwide: **8 × 1 km runs** alternating with **8 functional workout stations**, always performed in the same fixed order. Every racer — regardless of division — runs the same total distance of **8 km**. Divisions differ only in the weights, loads, and (historically) rep counts at the stations.

### 1.5 Course Layout

HYROX events are held in **large indoor venues** (convention centres, exhibition halls, arenas). The course layout follows a consistent template across all global events:

- **Running Track:** An approximately 1 km loop laid out **around the perimeter** (outside edge) of the venue. Depending on venue size, each 1 km run may consist of 1–5 laps. A dividing line splits the track into a **Fast Lane** (inside, for racers at ≤4:00/km pace) and a **Running Lane** (outside, for all others).
- **Roxzone (Transition Zone):** The central area **inside** the running track. Athletes enter and exit the Roxzone through clearly marked **IN and OUT arches** along one side of the running track. The Roxzone typically adds approximately **800 m to 1 km** of additional movement distance across the full race (jogging/walking between the running track and the workout stations).
- **Workout Stations:** All 8 stations are set up **inside** the Roxzone, in the centre of the venue. They are arranged sequentially so athletes proceed through them in order.
- **Start Tunnel:** A designated tunnel/chute where athletes assemble before their wave start.
- **Finish Line:** Positioned after the Wall Ball station (Station 8). Athletes proceed from Wall Balls to a "Finisher Stage" and cross the finish line.
- **Spectator Areas:** Marked zones adjacent to the Roxzone where spectators can watch the workout stations.

### 1.6 Wave Start System and Timing

HYROX uses a **wave start system** with waves departing at regular intervals, typically **every 10 minutes**. Key timing details:

- Each racer is assigned a specific start time communicated before race day and confirmed at check-in.
- The start time must be **written visibly on the racer's arm**.
- Starting in any wave other than the assigned one (without prior approval) results in **disqualification**.
- Racers within the same wave are always from the **same division** (e.g., all Men's Pro start together).
- A **timing chip** worn on the ankle records splits for each run, each Roxzone entry/exit, and each station completion. Doubles teams carry 2 chips; Relay teams carry 4.
- Racers must assemble in the **Start Zone Area** 10 minutes before their wave time.
- Wristband colour indicates division: White (Women's Open), Grey (Women's Pro / Men's Open), Black (Men's Pro), and/or Green (for specific identifiers).

### 1.8 Doubles Format Differences

HYROX Doubles is a **two-person team** format available in the following divisions:
- **Men's Doubles** (Open or Pro)
- **Women's Doubles** (Open or Pro)
- **Mixed Doubles** (Open only at regular events)

Key differences from Singles:

| Aspect | Singles | Doubles |

| Sled distances | 4 × 12.5 m | **8 × 12.5 m** (doubled distance for most stations) |
| Burpee Broad Jump | 80 m | **160 m total** (split between partners) |
| Farmers Carry | 200 m | **400 m total** (split between partners) |
| Sandbag Lunges | 100 m | **200 m total** (split between partners) |
| SkiErg | 1,000 m | **2,000 m total** |
| Rowing | 1,000 m | **2,000 m total** |
| Wall Balls | 100 reps | **200 reps total** |
| Weights (Open) | As per Open singles table | Same Open weights |
| Weights (Pro) | As per Pro singles table | Same Pro weights |
| Mixed Doubles | N/A | Uses **Men's Open weights** for all stations (which equals Women's Pro weights). Women's target height (2.70 m) for wall balls. |

### 1.9 Relay Format

The **Team Relay** is a 4-person event. Each team member completes **2 running segments and 2 workout stations**:
- Person 1: Run 1 → SkiErg → Run 2 → Sled Push
- Person 2: Run 3 → Sled Pull → Run 4 → Burpee Broad Jump
- Person 3: Run 5 → Rowing → Run 6 → Farmers Carry
- Person 4: Run 7 → Sandbag Lunges → Run 8 → Wall Balls

Available as Men's Relay, Women's Relay, and Mixed Relay. Uses Open weights.

### 2.3 Race Time Breakdown: Where Is Time Spent?

#### Scientific Data (Brandt et al., 2025 — Frontiers in Physiology)

A peer-reviewed study of 11 recreational HYROX athletes (median finish time 86.5 min, Individual Open Division) found:

| Component | Median Time | % of Total Race |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Total Running (8 km)** | 51.2 min | **~59%** |
| **Total Stations (8 stations)** | 32.8 min | **~38%** |
| **Roxzone / Transitions** | ~3–7 min (included in above) | **~3–7%** |
| **Full Race** | 86.5 min | 100% |

**Key finding:** Running time was **significantly longer** than station time (p = 0.003). Running accounts for approximately **50–60%** of total race time across all ability levels, with the percentage being slightly higher for slower athletes (who degrade more on later runs).

#### Elite vs. Average Breakdown (Roxlyfe.com Analysis — Pro Division)

| Component | Elite Men (~59 min) | Average Men (~90 min) | Elite Women (~66 min) | Average Women (~90 min) |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| **Total Running** | 30:46 (52%) | 42:26 (48%) | 34:27 (52%) | 44:09 (49%) |
| **Total Stations** | 25:10 (43%) | 39:50 (45%) | 28:48 (43%) | 39:49 (44%) |
| **Roxzone** | 2:54 (5%) | 6:58 (8%) | 3:47 (6%) | 6:12 (7%) |
| **Total** | 58:50 | 89:14 | 66:22 | 90:11 |

*(Source: roxlyfe.com "From Average to Elite" analysis)*

**Critical insight:** Running takes roughly **50–55%** of total time for elites and **48–50%** for average athletes (since slower athletes lose proportionally more time at stations). The Roxzone is **5–6% for elites** but balloons to **7–8%** for average athletes.

#### Station Time Rankings (Which Stations Take Longest)

Based on data from hyroxdatalab.com (200,000+ results) and the roxlyfe.com elite analysis:

**For recreational athletes (finishing ~1:30–1:40), from longest to shortest station time:**

| Rank | Station | Typical Time (Men, ~1:40 bracket) | Typical Time (Women, ~1:40 bracket) |
|------|---------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Wall Balls** | 8:02 | 6:30 |
| 2 | **Sled Pull** | 6:31 | 6:36 |
| 3 | **Burpee Broad Jump** | 5:15 | 6:00+ |
| 4 | **Sandbag Lunges** | 5:22 | 5:25 |
| 5 | **Rowing** | 4:35 | 5:12 |
| 6 | **SkiErg** | 4:17 | 4:51 |
| 7 | **Sled Push** | 3:40 | 3:48 |
| 8 | **Farmers Carry** | 2:32 | 2:45 |

**For elite athletes (finishing ~55–60 min):**

| Rank | Station | Typical Time (Elite Men) | Typical Time (Elite Women) |
|------|---------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1 | **Wall Balls** | 4:25 | 3:50 |
| 2 | **Rowing** | 3:58 | 4:29 |
| 3 | **SkiErg** | 3:47 | 4:12 |
| 4 | **Sled Pull** | 3:14 | 3:54 |
| 5 | **Sandbag Lunges** | 3:03 | 3:35 |
| 6 | **Sled Push** | 2:45 | 3:00 |
| 7 | **Burpee Broad Jump** | 2:21 | 3:11 |
| 8 | **Farmers Carry** | 1:37 | 1:57 |

### 2.4 The Biggest "Time Sinks" — Recreational vs. Elite

The **variance analysis** from hyroxdatalab.com (comparing 1:20 "advanced" to 1:40 "recreational" brackets) reveals which stations create the largest time gaps:

| Station | Time Variance (Men) | Time Variance (Women) | Priority Level |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| **Wall Balls** | **2:26** | **2:02** | 🔴 **HIGH** |
| **Roxzone (Total Transitions)** | **2:24** | **1:48** | 🔴 **HIGH** |
| **Burpee Broad Jump** | **1:47** | **2:08** | 🔴 **HIGH** |
| **Sandbag Lunges** | 1:27 | ~1:20 | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| **Sled Pull** | 1:16 | ~1:10 | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| **Sled Push** | 1:04 | ~0:50 | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| **Rowing** | 0:28 | ~0:30 | 🟢 LOW |
| **Farmers Carry** | 0:27 | ~0:25 | 🟢 LOW |
| **SkiErg** | 0:23 | ~0:25 | 🟢 LOW |

**Interpretation for coaches:**

- **Wall Balls** are the single biggest differentiator. A recreational male athlete averaging 8:02 vs. an advanced athlete at 5:36 — that's nearly **2.5 minutes** on one station alone. This is because wall balls demand sustained muscular endurance across 100 reps, and technique degrades rapidly under fatigue. A modest 20% improvement saves ~90 seconds.
- **Roxzone efficiency** is the "hidden" time sink. Elite athletes average **~28 seconds per transition** vs. ~52 seconds for recreational athletes. Over 8 transitions, that's **3:12 wasted** — with zero fitness required to improve it, just urgency and efficiency.
- **Burpee Broad Jumps** are the third-largest separator. They demand a unique combination of power, coordination, and cardio endurance that disproportionately punishes less fit athletes.
- **SkiErg, Rowing, and Farmers Carry** show the **smallest** variance. These are more "democratic" stations where technique and equipment constraints limit how much faster anyone can go. Focusing training time here yields diminishing returns.

The roxlyfe.com elite analysis shows an even more dramatic picture for the Sled Pull: elite men take 3:14 while average men take **6:31** — a ratio of 1:2, compared to a 1:1.3 ratio on Sled Push. The Sled Pull is disproportionately punishing for less-prepared athletes.

- **Training:** 5–6 sessions/week. Blend of running (40–60 km/week), HYROX-specific station work 2–3×/week, and strength training 2–3×/week.

#### Tier 3: 75–90 Minutes (Solid Recreational)

- **Who:** Athletes with general fitness backgrounds. Often 2nd–4th HYROX race. May have a running OR strength bias but not both.
- **Running pace:** 5:00–5:45/km. Significant pace degradation — runs 6, 7, and 8 are often 60–90 seconds slower than runs 1–2.
- **Station characteristics:**
  - SkiErg: 4:15–4:50
  - Sled Push: 3:20–4:00
  - Sled Pull: 4:30–6:00 (sled pull is often where strength-deficient athletes struggle badly)
  - Burpee Broad Jumps: 4:30–6:00
  - Rowing: 4:30–5:15

- **Training:** 3–5 sessions/week. General fitness with some HYROX-specific prep. Running 20–40 km/week.

#### Tier 4: 90+ Minutes (Beginner / Completion-Focused)

- **Who:** First-time HYROX racers, general fitness enthusiasts, those training for completion not competition.
- **Running pace:** 5:45–7:00+/km. Massive pace degradation is common. Run 1 may be 5:00/km but Run 8 can exceed 7:00/km. Walking intervals common in later runs.
- **Station characteristics:**
  - SkiErg: 4:45–5:30+
  - Sled Push: 3:45–5:00+ (may need to rest mid-push on heavy sleds)
  - Sled Pull: 5:30–8:00+ (this station can become a major bottleneck; athletes may need 7+ minutes)
  - Burpee Broad Jumps: 5:30–8:00+
  - Rowing: 4:45–5:45
  - Farmers Carry: 2:20–3:15+ (grip failures, need to put down kettlebells multiple times)
  - Sandbag Lunges: 5:00–7:00+
  - Wall Balls: 7:00–10:00+ (frequent rest breaks, technique deterioration, no-reps)
- **Roxzone:** Total ~7:00–12:00+. Average per transition: ~52–90 seconds. Extended rest periods, deliberate water breaks, mental regrouping.
- **Fitness characteristics:** VO₂max approximately 35–45 mL/kg/min. 5K time of 26–32+ min. Strength may be limited — sled push/pull and wall balls feel genuinely heavy. Heart rate remains very elevated (>85% HRmax for most of race). Blood lactate peaks at wall balls (the final station) — research shows RPE reaches 18/20 (Borg scale) during wall balls for recreational athletes.
- **Training:** 2–4 sessions/week of general fitness. Limited HYROX-specific preparation. First-timers often improve **15–25%** from first to second race simply through experience, pacing knowledge, and station familiarity.

### 2.9 Physiological Demands Summary

From Brandt et al. (2025), the first peer-reviewed HYROX study:

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| HR max during race | 185 bpm (median) | Significantly higher during stations than runs |
| HR average during race | 170.9 bpm | Consistently hard to very hard intensity |
| % of race at "very hard" intensity (>90% HRmax) | 79.5% | Dominant intensity zone |
| % of race at "hard" intensity (70-90% HRmax) | 19.6% | — |
| Blood lactate max | 8.5 mmol/L | Peaked during wall balls (final station) |
| Blood lactate avg | 6.3 mmol/L | Sustained moderate-high lactate throughout |
| RPE max (Borg scale) | 18 / 20 | Highest at wall balls |
| Strongest performance predictor | VO₂max (ρ = -0.71) | Aerobic capacity is king |
| Second predictor | Body fat % (ρ = 0.67) | Lower body fat = faster time |
| Third predictor | Endurance training volume (ρ = -0.68) | More endurance training = better |
| Strength correlation | **Not significant** (p > 0.05) | HGS, muscle mass % did not correlate with total time |

**Key coaching implication:** HYROX is fundamentally an **endurance event** with strength components, not a strength event with running. The scientific data shows that once athletes have sufficient strength to handle the competition loads, further aerobic capacity development is the primary path to faster times. However, station-specific work remains critical for the high-variance stations (wall balls, burpee broad jumps, sled pull).

### 2.10 Training Time Allocation Recommendation (Based on Data)

The hyroxdatalab.com "70/30 Strategy" and roxlyfe.com analysis converge on the following evidence-based training allocation:

| Training Focus | Allocation | Rationale |
|---------------|------------|-----------|
| **Aerobic Base / Running** | 40–50% of total training | Running is 50–55% of race time. VO₂max is the #1 predictor. |
| **High-Variance Station Work** (Wall Balls, Burpee Broad Jumps, Sled Pull) | 25–30% of total training | These 3 stations + Roxzone account for **6–8 minutes** of potential time savings. |
| **Medium-Variance Station Work** (Sled Push, Sandbag Lunges) | 10–15% of total training | Moderate improvement opportunity (3–4 min savings). |
| **Low-Variance Station Work** (SkiErg, Rowing, Farmers Carry) | 5–10% of total training | Important for technique but limited time-saving leverage (1–2 min). |
| **Compromised Running Practice** | Embedded in above | Running immediately after station work is a critical HYROX-specific skill. |
| **Roxzone / Transition Practice** | Mental + habitual | "Free" time savings — requires urgency and efficiency, not fitness. Target <6.5% of total race time. |

# Comprehensive HYROX Coach Reference Document: Pacing Strategy & Race Execution

---

## 1. Pacing Strategy for HYROX

### 1.1 Optimal Pacing for the 1 km Run Segments

#### Should Athletes Negative Split, Even Split, or Positive Split?

The evidence overwhelmingly favours **even pacing** as the gold-standard approach for HYROX. Analysis from the 2022 HYROX World Championships in Las Vegas shows that the **top 5 Elite finishers ran significantly more consistent splits** than the rest of the Elite field, and far more consistent than average Pro division competitors finishing around the 85-minute mark (Rox Lyfe, "How to Pace Your Running at HYROX"). The top performers also showed a **6-second or less difference** between their fastest and slowest 1 km run times across runs 2–7 (HyroxTrainingPlans.com).

The three core strategies break down as follows:

| Strategy | Best For | Risk Level | Time Efficiency |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Negative Split** (start slow, finish fast) | First-time racers, cautious athletes | Low | Good — but leaves 1–3 min on the table |
| **Even Pacing** (consistent effort throughout) | Experienced athletes targeting a specific time | Moderate (requires discipline) | Optimal for most athletes |
| **Controlled Fast Start** (bank time early) | Elite/sub-1:15 men, sub-1:24 women | High | Fastest potential, but highest blow-up risk |

**Recommendation for most athletes:** Even pacing. Athletes who pace evenly (within 10% variance across runs) finish **5–10% faster** than those who sprint early and fade late (HyroxDataLab). The data is unambiguous: consistent pacing isn't about holding back — it's about distributing effort optimally.

#### How Does Pacing Change Across the 8 Runs?

A subtle adjustment is expected even in "even pacing" strategies because of **cumulative fatigue**. Expect runs 5–8 to be **10–20 seconds/km slower** than runs 1–2, which is physiologically normal and should be planned for rather than fought against (HyroxDataLab Pacing Calculator Guide).

Key nuances about specific run segments:

- **Run 1:** The first run is often shorter or longer than 1 km due to the start line being in a different place from the RoxZone exit. At the 2022 World Championships, **the top 5 Elite finishers went out relatively slower** on the first run compared to the rest of the Elite field, who in turn went out slower than the average Pro competitor. The athletes with the slowest overall times tended to go out the fastest on Run 1 (Rox Lyfe). Start 5–10 seconds/km slower than your target pace on Run 1.
- **Runs 2–4:** Settle into target pace. This is the "find your rhythm" zone. Resist the urge to speed up because you feel good — this is glycogen you'll desperately need later.
- **Runs 5–7:** The grind. Allow a natural 10–15 sec/km slowdown. Don't panic if your pace drops slightly — this is expected. What matters is **consistent effort**, not consistent pace.
- **Run 8:** The final run often feels longer because it includes extra distance to reach the wall ball station. Manage expectations accordingly. If you've paced well, you may have enough to push slightly harder here, but the priority is arriving at wall balls with enough in the tank for 75–100 reps.

#### Target Run Paces by Goal Finish Time

| Goal Finish Time | Avg Run Pace (per km) | Avg Station Time Budget (all 8) | Total RoxZone Budget |
|---|---|---|---|
| **2:00:00** (Beginner) | 6:15–6:30/km | ~52:00 (avg ~6:30/station) | ~11:00 |
| **1:45:00** (Intermediate-) | 5:30–5:45/km | ~44:00 (avg ~5:30/station) | ~10:00 |
| **1:30:00** (Intermediate+) | 5:00–5:25/km | ~37:00 (avg ~4:40/station) | ~9:00 |
| **1:15:00** (Advanced) | 4:30–4:45/km | ~29:00 (avg ~3:40/station) | ~7:00 |
| **1:10:00** (Elite) | 4:15–4:30/km | ~27:30 (avg ~3:25/station) | ~5:00 |

*Sources: HyroxDataLab Pacing Calculator, HyroxTrainingPlans.com, Rox Lyfe*

**How to determine your individual pace:** Run 1 km at approximately 85% of your max heart rate on a track. The time you record is a rough proxy for your per-km target at HYROX. Alternatively, your HYROX run pace will typically align with your **half-marathon or marathon pace** — not your 5K pace. Most athletes' HYROX run splits are significantly slower than their 10K race pace due to the accumulated fatigue from stations (Rox Lyfe).

---

### 1.2 Heart Rate Zone Management Across the Entire Race

#### Target HR Zones: Runs vs Stations vs Transitions

Heart rate management is critical because HYROX forces constant toggling between aerobic (running) and anaerobic (station) efforts over 60–150 minutes. One data point from Precision Hydration: an athlete completing HYROX in 70 minutes had an **average heart rate of 154 bpm — 96% of max HR**. That's the equivalent sustained effort of a half marathon.

| Race Phase | Target HR Zone | % Max HR | Perceived Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Runs 1–3** | Zone 3 (High Aerobic) | 70–78% | Conversational to moderately hard; can speak in short sentences |
| **Runs 4–6** | Zone 3–4 (Tempo/Threshold) | 75–85% | Uncomfortable but controlled; sentences become difficult |
| **Runs 7–8** | Zone 4 (Threshold) | 80–88% | Hard; racing effort, fuelled by remaining reserves |
| **Stations (SkiErg, Row)** | Zone 4 (Threshold) | 80–88% | Controlled intensity, not maximal |
| **Stations (Sled Push/Pull)** | Zone 4–5 (Threshold–VO2max) | 85–92% | Near-max leg effort; expect HR spike |
| **Stations (Burpees, Lunges, Wall Balls)** | Zone 4 (Threshold) | 80–90% | Sustained muscular endurance |
| **Farmers Carry** | Zone 3–4 | 78–85% | Brisk walk; grip and posture challenge more than cardiovascular |
| **RoxZone Transitions** | Zone 2–3 (Recovery/Aerobic) | 65–75% | Active recovery; jog lightly, don't walk or stand still |

*Sources: HyroxTrainingPlans.com, Box Nutrition, Bend and Mend Physiotherapy*

#### How HR Drift Affects Pacing in the Second Half

**Cardiac drift** — the gradual upward creep of heart rate at the same pace — is inevitable over 60–150 minutes of sustained effort. As core temperature rises, plasma volume decreases (from sweating), and glycogen stores deplete, the heart must beat faster to deliver the same cardiac output.

Practical implications:
- **By run 5–6**, the same pace that kept you at 75% max HR in run 1 may now produce 82–85% max HR. This is normal.
- **Don't chase the same HR numbers** in the second half. Instead, shift to monitoring **perceived effort** and **pace**. If your pace is within 10–20 sec/km of your early splits and you feel "controlled hard," you're on track.
- **If HR exceeds 90–92% max for sustained periods** during runs in the second half, you need to slow down. Continuing at that intensity will cause a dramatic fade and potentially compromise your ability to complete stations.
- **Dehydration accelerates drift.** Every 1% loss in bodyweight from sweat can increase HR by 5–8 bpm. This is why hydration strategy matters enormously (see Section 2.4).

#### HR Ceiling to Avoid Early in the Race

The single most important HR rule for HYROX: **do not exceed 85% of max HR during the first three run segments**. Going above this threshold in the early stages depletes glycogen disproportionately fast, spikes lactate accumulation, and accelerates core temperature rise — all of which compound exponentially in the second half (HyroxTrainingPlans.com, Bend and Mend Physiotherapy).

Think of it as a **"spending budget."** The aerobic energy you save in runs 1–3 by staying at 70–78% max HR is the exact energy you'll need to maintain technique during wall balls and push through runs 7–8.

### 1.3 Station-Specific Pacing

#### SkiErg (1,000 m)

The SkiErg is Station 1 — the very first functional exercise after Run 1. The temptation to blast it (fresh legs, adrenaline) is real, but the risk/reward is poor. Analysis shows the SkiErg has one of the **lowest time variances** across finish-time brackets — only about 22 seconds separating a 1:20 finisher from a 1:40 finisher (HyroxDataLab). Meaning: going 15 seconds faster here by redlining your effort costs far more energy than the time it saves.

| Metric | Beginner (2:00 goal) | Intermediate (1:30 goal) | Elite (1:10 goal) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Target /500m split | 2:45–3:00 | 2:05–2:15 | 1:50–1:55 |
| Stroke rate | 35–40 spm | 40–50 spm | 48–55 spm |
| Total station time | ~6:00 | ~4:30 | ~3:50 |

**Pacing breakdown:**
- **First 200 m:** 60–70% effort. Establish rhythm and breathing pattern. Do not sprint (RMR Training, Centr/Meg Jacobi).
- **Middle 600 m:** Lock into target pace. Maintain stroke rate at 45–55 spm. This should feel like your **5K running effort** — strong but controlled (RMR Training, James Hall).
- **Final 200 m:** Increase effort only if sustainable. Prepare mentally for the transition to Run 2.

**Key coaching cue:** "Sacrificing a few seconds on your overall ski time will yield a better run afterward — where there is more to gain. Risk to reward!" — Meg Jacobi, HYROX athlete (Centr).

**Technique note:** Drive power from the legs and core, not just the arms. Hinge at the hips, engage the lats, and pull through with full extension. Arm-dominant athletes will burn out their shoulders — which they need for sled pull, rowing, and wall balls later.

#### Sled Push (4 × 12.5 m lengths)

The sled push is Station 2, and it is **where more races are lost than any other station**. At the 2023 North American Championships, many elite male competitors reportedly destroyed their race by going too fast on the sled push (Rox Lyfe). The problem is physics: once you stop the sled, static friction is **3–5 times greater** than kinetic friction, meaning restarting costs enormously more energy than keeping the sled crawling forward (HyroxTrainingPlans.com).

| Metric | Beginner (2:00 goal) | Intermediate (1:30 goal) | Elite (1:10 goal) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total station time | ~5:00 | ~3:30 | ~2:30 |
| Strategy | Stop-and-go with 3–5 sec rests | Continuous with minor slow-downs | Continuous, aggressive |

**Continuous vs stop-and-go:**
- **Continuous (recommended for intermediate+):** Never let the sled fully stop. If you need to "rest," slow to a crawl but keep the sled moving. Even 1–2 inches per second of movement is better than zero. This avoids the massive energy cost of breaking static friction every time you restart.
- **Stop-and-go (acceptable for beginners):** If you must stop, keep rests to **3–5 seconds maximum** (Rezerv.co). Stop approximately **5 steps before your legs start burning** — lactic acid clearance is exponential, so the more you accumulate, the longer recovery takes (Women's Health/HYROX coach advice).

**Technique essentials:**
- Keep body low — 45-degree angle between torso and ground.
- Use short, choppy steps: **6–8 inch steps, 120+ steps per minute cadence** (HyroxTrainingPlans.com). Long strides create a stop-start pattern.
- First 3 steps of each length: MAX effort to break static friction.
- Breathe rhythmically: exhale every 2–3 steps.
- Arms: extended (for leverage) or slightly bent — experiment in training.

**Post-sled recovery:** Take 5 deep breaths with hands on knees. Shake out quads before transitioning. The run immediately after sled push (Run 3) is where you'll feel the worst. Expect it. Accept a 10–15 sec/km pace drop.

#### Sled Pull (Hand-Over-Hand)

The sled pull is Station 3. It's less about brute strength and more about **minimising dead time between pulls**.

**Pacing strategy:**
- Run (don't walk) to the far end of the lane to set up.
- Sit or brace your feet, lean back, and begin pulling hand-over-hand with steady, rhythmic pulls.
- **Minimise rest between rope grabs.** Most time lost at sled pull is from athletes taking long pauses between pulls of the rope and walking slowly between lengths (Rox Lyfe).
- Keep a consistent rhythm: think of it like climbing a rope — one hand immediately follows the other.
- Once the sled reaches you, stand up quickly, run (don't walk) back to the start, and begin again.

| Metric | Beginner (2:00 goal) | Intermediate (1:30 goal) | Elite (1:10 goal) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total station time | ~6:00 | ~4:00 | ~3:00 |

**Key coaching cue:** "Hustle on sled pull. You can push yourself a little more here without compromising yourself for the rest of the race" (Rox Lyfe). Chalk your hands beforehand — grip failure means dropped ropes and wasted time.

#### Burpee Broad Jumps (80 m)

Station 4. This is the most metabolically brutal station — it combines a full-body power movement (burpee) with explosive horizontal displacement (broad jump). The station typically takes **3–6 minutes** depending on fitness level (HyroxTrainingPlans.com).

**Rep tempo and pacing:**
- **Conservative pacing (recommended):** Start at 70–80% max intensity. Find a rhythm and maintain **consistent jump distance** throughout. Do NOT sprint the first 20m and limp the last 60m.
- **Target rep tempo:** Aim for one complete burpee broad jump every **3.5–5 seconds** depending on your level.
- **When to slow down vs push:** If your jump distance drops below ~1.2m (indicating muscular failure), slow your tempo slightly rather than attempting explosive jumps that cover no distance. Maintaining consistent distance per jump is more efficient than variable bursts.
- **Break strategy:** Unlike wall balls, burpee broad jumps don't lend themselves well to formal "break sets." Instead, maintain a steady rhythm. If you must pause, take **2–3 breaths standing** then resume — do NOT sit or lie down (George Anderson's "Get Out of the Chair" principle from Rox Lyfe).

**Key coaching cue:** "Avoid the burst-and-pause approach. Instead, find a steady pace you can maintain" (Women's Health).

#### Rowing (1,000 m)

Station 5. The row comes at the midpoint of the race, after the devastating burpee broad jumps. Your heart rate will be elevated; your goal is to use the rower as a **controlled reset**, not another sprint.

| Metric | Beginner (2:00 goal) | Intermediate (1:30 goal) | Elite (1:10 goal) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Target /500m split | 2:30–2:45 | 2:05–2:20 | 1:50–1:55 |
| Stroke rate | 22–26 spm | 24–28 spm | 26–30 spm |
| Total station time | ~6:00 | ~4:45 | ~3:50 |

**Pacing formula:** Your HYROX row pace should be approximately **your 2K rowing time trial pace + 10 seconds per 500m** (RMR Training/James Hall). This feels "strong but controlled" — not like you're hunting a PR.

**Technical emphasis:**
- **Power through the legs** (70% leg drive, 20% back, 10% arms). Arm-dominant rowing is inefficient and will fatigue your biceps and grip for farmers carry later.
- **Keep stroke rate steady at 24–28 spm.** Avoid fluctuations — each surge and recovery wastes energy.
- **Monitor the /500m split display** and aim for consistency from the first stroke to the last.

The rowing station, like the SkiErg, has **very low time variance** across finish-time brackets (~28 seconds; HyroxDataLab). Going 10 seconds faster by sprinting is not worth the energy it costs.

#### Farmers Carry (200 m)

Station 6. This station is unique in that **you should go as fast as humanly possible** (Rox Lyfe, "Full Send Farmers"). Here's why: grip endurance is the limiting factor, and the longer you hold the kettlebells, the worse it gets. Speed reduces total time under load.

| Metric | Beginner (2:00 goal) | Intermediate (1:30 goal) | Elite (1:10 goal) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total station time | ~4:00 | ~2:30 | ~1:10–1:30 |
| Pace | Brisk walk, 1–2 stops | Fast walk, 0–1 stops | Near-jog, unbroken |

**Walk pace:** Move at the fastest sustainable walk (or light jog) you can manage. Think "power walk" — upright posture, arms locked, short quick steps.

**Grip management:**
- **Chalk your hands** before starting — sweaty palms are the #1 cause of dropped kettlebells (Rox Lyfe).
- Maintain **tall posture**: shoulders packed, chest up, core braced. Dr. Adam Storey (HYROX Sports Science Advisory Council) classifies the farmers carry as a **"postural endurance test"** — the athlete who maintains upright posture the longest maintains their speed the longest (Rox Lyfe Farmers Carry Guide).
- **When to set down:** Only if you physically cannot hold on. Every stop costs ~5–10 seconds (setting down + shaking out + picking up + re-gripping). Aim for 0 stops if targeting sub-1:30, 0–1 stops if targeting sub-2:00.
- There is **no penalty for setting the kettlebells down** (unlike the sandbag in lunges), but every stop kills your time.

**Coaching cue:** "You don't really need much grip strength for the rest of the race. So going all out on the farmers is worthwhile." (Rox Lyfe).

#### Sandbag Lunges (100 m)

Station 7. Data from HyroxDataLab's analysis of HYROX Utrecht shows that sandbag lunges are a **high-leverage station** with massive time variance (87–88 seconds across finish-time brackets) but **near-zero correlation with Run 8 performance** (r = -0.084 for men, -0.072 for women). This demolishes the common "save legs for the final run" myth.

**Step tempo:**
- Target **0.9–1.1 m step length** (100–110 total steps for men, 110–120 for women).
- Longer steps shift load from quads → glutes/hamstrings, which **preserves quads for wall balls** (the very next station, where correlation is strong: r = 0.738).
- **Constant movement** — touch-and-go on the back knee. Do not pause at the bottom of each rep.
- Step cadence: approximately one lunge every 2.5–3.5 seconds.

**Breathing pattern:** Exhale forcefully on the drive up (concentric phase), inhale at the bottom (eccentric phase). Keep breathing rhythmic and tied to movement.

| Metric | Beginner (2:00 goal) | Intermediate (1:30 goal) | Elite (1:10 goal) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total station time | ~8:00 | ~5:00–5:30 | ~3:30–4:15 |
| Step count target | 130–150 | 100–120 | 90–105 |

**Coaching cue:** "Attack the sandbag lunges aggressively. The time you lose going slow hurts your finish time directly, while the theoretical fatigue you're avoiding doesn't materially impact your final run." (HyroxDataLab).

#### Wall Balls (75 reps women / 100 reps men)

Station 8 — the final functional station. You're exhausted, your quads are wrecked from lunges, and you have 75–100 reps between you and the finish line. **A break strategy is essential.**

**Break strategies:**

| Strategy | Reps Pattern | Rest Between Sets | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| Aggressive (Unbroken) | 100 straight | None | Elite athletes with exceptional fitness |
| Semi-Aggressive | 25-25-25-25 or 30-30-25-15 | 3–5 sec | Strong intermediate athletes |
| Conservative | 20-20-20-20-20 | 3–5 sec | Most athletes — **recommended** |
| Very Conservative | 15-15-15-15-15-10-15 | 5–8 sec | Beginners or athletes with poor upper body endurance |

**Rep tempo:** Each wall ball rep should take approximately **2.5–3.5 seconds** (catch → squat → drive → release → catch). Find a metronome-like rhythm and lock in.

**Key coaching cue:** "If you start off by doing as many as you can (say you manage 40 unbroken) but that leaves your shoulders completely fried and massively slows you down for the remainder, then you didn't pace appropriately. It's possible you should have just done 25 and had a very short pause before carrying on." (Rox Lyfe).

**Technique under fatigue:** Keep feet planted, use **legs** (not arms/shoulders) to generate upward force. If the ball starts hitting below the target line, you're burning out — take a micro-break rather than accumulating no-reps from the judge.

### 1.4 When to Push vs Conserve: Station Reward Analysis

Not all stations reward aggressive pacing equally. Based on data analysis from HyroxDataLab and coaching literature:

| Station | Variance Across Finish Brackets | Push or Conserve? | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SkiErg** | Low (22 sec) | **Conserve** — controlled, 70–80% effort | Minimal time gain from going harder; high energy cost |
| **Sled Push** | Moderate-High | **Conserve** — steady, never stop | Lactic acid from over-pushing destroys subsequent runs |
| **Sled Pull** | Moderate | **Moderate push** — hustle between pulls | Dead time (walking, resting) is the biggest time sink |
| **Burpee Broad Jumps** | High (107 sec) | **Steady push** — consistent tempo | Burst-and-pause approach is worse than sustained rhythm |
| **Rowing** | Low (28 sec) | **Conserve** — strong but controlled | Same as SkiErg; diminishing returns from extra effort |
| **Farmers Carry** | Low (26 sec) | **Full send** — go as fast as possible | Speed reduces time under load; grip doesn't matter after |
| **Sandbag Lunges** | High (87–88 sec) | **Attack aggressively** | Near-zero correlation with Run 8; huge time-gain opportunity |
| **Wall Balls** | Highest (146 sec) | **Controlled push** — smart break strategy | Highest variance = biggest training/execution payoff |

**Summary principle:** Conserve on the machines (SkiErg, Row) where extra effort yields minimal time savings but massive energy cost. Attack the high-variance bodyweight/loaded stations (lunges, wall balls, burpees) where execution and fitness translate directly into large time gains.

## 2. Common Mistakes & Race Execution

### 2.1 Most Common Training Mistakes in HYROX Preparation

#### Neglecting Running Volume

HYROX is **50% running** (8 km total), yet many gym-goers disproportionately focus on station work. As Gymshark's HYROX training guide bluntly states: "Train like you are training for a half marathon, and as long as you can do the movements, you can't go wrong." If you can't comfortably run 8 km, no amount of sled push strength will save you (Gymshark, Connect the Watts).

**The fix:** Run 2–3 days per week minimum. Include one long easy run (Zone 2, 45–60 min), one tempo/threshold run (Zone 4, 20–30 min), and one interval session. Build to ~25–35 km/week if targeting sub-1:30 (Rox Lyfe, Connect the Watts).

#### Over-Focusing on Strength at the Expense of Endurance

HYROX is not a 1-rep max test. The sled weighs 152 kg (men) or 102 kg (women) and must be pushed repeatedly, not once. A massive squat won't help if you can't push the sled for 50 m without extended breaks (Connect the Watts).

**The fix:** Train **strength-endurance**: moderate loads, higher reps (12–20), shorter rest periods (60–90 sec). Use race-weight loads in training regularly. If you can deadlift 200 kg but can't push the race sled without stopping 6 times, your training is misaligned.

#### Not Practicing Transitions

The RoxZone (transition area) can account for **5–11 minutes** of total race time. Every second wasted walking, standing, or lingering at water stations adds up across 8 transitions. Many athletes unknowingly add 2–4 minutes by treating transitions as rest periods (Rox Lyfe, Connect the Watts).

**The fix:** In training, set up stations so you must run/walk briskly into them. Practice flowing from a run directly into station work without hesitation. Aim for RoxZone times of **under 1:00–1:15 per transition** for intermediate athletes and **under 45 seconds** for advanced (HyroxDataLab).

#### Not Doing Full Simulations

The standardised format of HYROX makes it tempting to simulate the full race frequently — but doing full simulations too often risks overtraining and injury. Conversely, **never** doing one means you won't know how station-to-station fatigue compounds (Rox Lyfe, 3in1Sports).

**The fix:** Complete **1–2 full HYROX simulations** (or scaled half-simulations) in the 6–8 weeks before your race. These should be at race pace. "A realistic HYROX plan is not just a thought experiment — it's a plan you *test*" (3in1Sports). Beyond that, train station-specific work in smaller, targeted blocks with progressive overload.

---

### 2.2 Most Common Race-Day Execution Errors

#### Going Out Too Fast on Run 1

This is the **single most common mistake** in HYROX. Adrenaline, crowd energy, and 50 other athletes sprinting beside you create an irresistible urge to hammer the first kilometre. The data from the 2022 World Championships shows that **slower overall finishers went out relatively faster on Run 1**, while the fastest finishers were deliberately conservative at the start (Rox Lyfe).

**The fix:** Write your target Run 1 split on your wrist. Use a GPS watch with a lap timer. Trust the data, not the feeling. "Consistent pacing will almost certainly mean deliberately slowing yourself towards the start of the race. You will likely feel like you could be going faster — and many athletes around you *will* be going faster. This can be mentally challenging." (Rox Lyfe).

#### Poor Sled Technique Wasting Energy

Bad technique — high body angle, long strides, and full stops between lengths — can cost **60–120 seconds** and leave your quads destroyed for subsequent runs. Many athletes treat the sled push like a sprint rather than a sustained grind (Connect the Watts, HyroxTrainingPlans.com).

**The fix:** Keep body at a 45-degree angle, use short choppy steps (120+ cadence), and **never let the sled fully stop**. Static friction requires 3–5x more force to overcome than kinetic friction. Slow to a crawl if you must, but keep the sled moving (HyroxTrainingPlans.com).

#### Not Having a Wall Ball Break Strategy

Going for an unbroken set of 75–100 wall balls when you haven't trained for it leads to complete muscular failure around rep 35–45, followed by agonisingly long rests and a total time that's **worse** than if you'd planned breaks from the start (Rox Lyfe).

**The fix:** Determine your break strategy in training. For most athletes, **sets of 20–25 with 3–5 second rests** is optimal. Commit to this plan regardless of how you feel at the start of the station.

#### Ignoring Nutrition and Hydration

HYROX typically lasts 60–150 minutes at near-maximal sustained effort. Studies show that 40–50% of recreational athletes begin exercise in a **mildly dehydrated state** (Precision Hydration). Starting under-fuelled means glycogen depletion kicks in around Station 4–5, causing dramatic power output drops and cognitive decline.

**The fix:** See Section 2.4 below for a complete fuelling protocol.

---

### 2.3 Race-Day Nutrition and Hydration

#### Pre-Race Meal Timing and Composition

| Timing | What to Eat | Quantity |
|---|---|---|
| **Day before** | Carb-loading: aim for 8 g carbs/kg bodyweight | E.g., 640 g carbs for an 80 kg athlete |
| **Night before** | Preload hydration: strong electrolyte drink (1500 mg sodium) + 500 ml water | 1 serving |
| **2–3 hours before** | High-carb, low-fibre, low-fat meal (toast, rice, porridge, bagel) | ~100–150 g carbs |
| **1–2 hours before** | Carb-rich snack (energy bar, rice cake, banana) | ~30–50 g carbs |
| **90 minutes before** | Electrolyte preload: 1500 mg sodium + 500 ml water | 1 serving |
| **20–30 minutes before** | Caffeine gel or chew (if tolerated; 3–6 mg/kg caffeine) | 1 gel (~30 g carbs) |

*Sources: Precision Hydration, AidStation/Ash Miller (Dietitian), StartHyrox*

**Critical rule:** Never try new nutrition on race day. Test everything — gels, electrolytes, pre-race meals — during training sessions first. Energy gels cause GI distress in some people, and discovering this mid-race is catastrophic (Rox Lyfe).

#### During-Race Fuelling

| Race Duration | Fuelling Protocol |
|---|---|
| **Under 75 min** | Pre-race fuelling should carry you through. Carry 1 gel for a mid-race boost if needed. Sip water at RoxZone stations. |
| **75 min – 2 hours** | Aim for **30–60 g carbs per hour** via gels or chews. Take them during RoxZone transitions or less intense moments (e.g., after farmers carry). Carry a 500 ml soft flask with electrolytes. |
| **Over 2 hours** | Aim for **30–60 g carbs per hour.** Plan 2–3 gels across the race. Carry electrolyte flask. Take additional fluid at every water station. |

**Timing tip:** A good moment for a mid-race gel is **after Station 4 (burpee broad jumps), just before Run 5** — you're at the halfway point, and the carbohydrates will take ~20–30 minutes to hit your bloodstream, providing a boost precisely when the second-half grind begins (AidStation).

#### What to Consume at Water Stations

The RoxZone water stations are your only opportunity for mid-race hydration. Take **small sips** — 100–200 ml maximum — to manage thirst without causing sloshing or GI discomfort. If carrying a soft flask with electrolytes, take a larger sip from that. Do not stop moving while drinking. Walk briskly or jog while sipping (Precision Hydration, Rox Lyfe).

### 2.4 Warm-Up Protocols

#### Timing

| Event | Timing |
|---|---|
| Arrive at venue | 60–90 minutes before wave start |
| Begin warm-up | 30–45 minutes before wave start |
| Complete warm-up | 5–10 minutes before wave start |
| Total warm-up duration | 12–20 minutes of active work |

*Sources: RMR Training, BLDRSports, DocLyss Fitness*

#### Specific Warm-Up Routine

**Phase 1: Aerobic Activation (7–10 minutes, starting ~45 min out)**
- Light jog, bike, or row at easy effort (Zone 1–2)
- Goal: raise core temperature, activate aerobic system
- Don't worry if you feel sluggish — pre-race jitters are normal (RMR Training)

**Phase 2: Intensity Ramp (5–8 minutes, starting ~30 min out)**
- Run 3 minutes at marathon pace
- 500 m SkiErg at target race pace (your 2K pace + 5–7 seconds)
- Or 3–4 rounds of: 1 min run + 1 min SkiErg/Row + 1 min bike (RMR Training)
- Goal: elevate HR to race-ready levels without depleting energy

**Phase 3: Mobility and Station-Specific Drills (5–10 minutes, starting ~15 min out)**
- Hip flexors and quads (running, lunges)
- Shoulders and lats (SkiErg, rowing, wall balls)
- Ankles and calves (running, jumping)
- Practice light reps: push sled 10 m, 3–5 burpee broad jumps, carry farmer handles 10–15 m, 5–10 wall balls
- Goal: coordination and confidence, not fatigue (RMR Training, BLDRSports)

**Phase 4: Final Priming (3–5 minutes, starting ~10 min out)**
- 2–3 × 20–30 second race-pace pickups with walking recovery
- 4–6 × 100 m strides at ~800 m pace (RMR Training)
- This primes the nervous system and makes Run 1 feel familiar
- Put on race shoes and test with a few strides

**Phase 5: Mental Reset (final 2–3 minutes)**
- Deep breathing exercises
- Visualise your first 3 stations
- Review pacing plan (written on wrist or arm)
- Find your mantra or focus word

*Sources: RMR Training, BLDRSports, DocLyss Fitness*

#### Common Warm-Up Mistakes

- **Skipping it entirely** — leaves you sluggish through Run 1 and SkiErg
- **Overdoing it** — a 30-minute high-intensity warm-up depletes energy you need for the race
- **Trying new movements** — the warm-up is for activation, not experimentation
- **Letting the warm-up dictate expectations** — how you feel warming up often does not predict race performance (RMR Training)

### 2.5 Mental Models Used by Top Competitors

#### "Station + Next Run = One Unit" Mindset

Rather than thinking of HYROX as 16 individual segments (8 runs + 8 stations), elite competitors chunk the race into **8 units**, each consisting of one station and the subsequent run. This reframing reduces the cognitive load of "16 things to get through" to "8 blocks, one at a time."

Within each unit, the station is the work and the run is the recovery. This prevents the demoralising feeling of finishing a brutal station only to face "another run." Instead, the run is part of the same block — your body's chance to flush lactate and reset before the next block begins.

#### Process Goals vs Outcome Goals

Top competitors focus on **process goals** during the race rather than outcome goals:

- ❌ Outcome goal: "I need to finish in 1:28"
- ✅ Process goal: "Hit 5:15 on this kilometre" or "Do 25 wall balls, then break"

Process goals keep you focused on the controllable present moment. Outcome goals create anxiety about the future and tempt you to make irrational mid-race decisions (like sprinting Run 3 to "bank time").

**Framework for setting race-day process goals:**
1. Write target splits for each segment on your wrist band
2. At the start of each segment, state your goal: "This run is 5:20"
3. At the end of each segment, assess: "Did I hit it? If not, what's the adjustment?"
4. Move on. Don't carry frustration from one segment to the next.

#### Self-Talk Strategies

George Anderson (well-being and performance coach featured on Rox Lyfe) recommends several self-talk frameworks:

- **"Get Out of the Chair":** When overwhelmed by what's ahead (80 m of burpee broad jumps, for example), don't think about the full distance. Just focus on doing the first rep. Then the next. "Get that first burpee done rather than dwelling on 80 metres of them." This short-term focus keeps you present and moving (Rox Lyfe/George Anderson).

- **"Embrace the Suck":** Reframe pain as a signal that you're giving 5–10% more, not that something is wrong. "Those feelings of pain and exertion can be quite unnerving if you aren't used to it. When you instead see them as signals that you're giving another 5–10%, and that it's not going to get any worse, and you just need to sustain this for a short period of time, that does something quite fundamental to your motivation." (George Anderson, Rox Lyfe).

- **"Through the Line":** Never ease up before a segment is complete. Always push through the finish of each station and each run. "Don't lose that last little bit of performance which could make it or break it." (George Anderson, Rox Lyfe).

- **Aggressive vs Passive Self-Talk:** Research on self-talk in endurance sport suggests that **instructional** ("Drive your knees") and **motivational** ("Let's go!") cues are more effective than reassuring cues ("I can do this"). Use commanding, action-oriented language.

#### Managing the Pain Cave in Runs 5–8

Runs 5 through 8 are where HYROX becomes a mental battle. Cumulative fatigue, glycogen depletion, and HR drift converge to make every step feel harder. Here's the mental framework used by top competitors:

1. **Break the remaining race into shrinking chunks:** After Run 5, you have "only 3 stations left." After Run 6, "only 2." This creates a sense of acceleration even as your body is decelerating.

2. **Use external focus:** Count laps, watch other athletes, engage with the crowd. Internal focus ("my legs hurt") amplifies perceived effort. External focus ("I need to pass that person ahead") reduces it.

3. **Reframe the suffering:** As Liz Yelling (world-class distance runner) explained to George Anderson: "What sets the top performers apart is their willingness to suffer — their ability to embrace discomfort and simply endure more pain than others." The athletes around you are suffering equally. The question is: who keeps moving?

4. **Nutritional intervention:** If you haven't already taken your mid-race gel, Run 5 is the time. The psychological effect of "I just took fuel, I'll feel better in 10 minutes" is almost as powerful as the actual carbohydrate boost.

5. **Station countdown:** After every station in the second half, mentally cross it off. "Rowing is done. I will never row again today. Three to go." This is especially powerful after the farmers carry (Station 6), where you can remind yourself: "Only lunges and wall balls stand between me and the finish."

6. **Mantras:** Simple, repeatable phrases work best under extreme fatigue when complex thought breaks down. Examples used by competitors:
   - "Smooth is fast"
   - "One more"
   - "This is what I trained for"
   - "I don't stop"

# HYROX Workout Stations: Complete Tactical Breakdown for AI Coach Knowledge Base

> **Purpose:** This document serves as the definitive tactical reference for an AI-powered Hyrox coach. It covers optimal technique, common mistakes, target times, muscle group impact, and training progressions for all eight workout stations. Data is sourced from Hyrox race analytics (700,000+ results via HyroxDataLab), coaching platforms (Rox Lyfe, TheProgrm, Hybrid Athlete Club, OnlyGains.ai), Centr (official Hyrox equipment provider), and elite athlete insights.

## Station 1: SkiErg (1000m)

The SkiErg is the first functional station you encounter after your opening 1km run. It sets the tone for the entire race. Because it's Station 1, many athletes make the critical error of going out too hard—burning through glycogen and spiking heart rate before seven more stations and seven more 1km runs remain.

### Optimal Technique

The SkiErg stroke consists of two phases: **the pull** and **the recovery**.

**The Pull Phase:**
- **Initiate with your lats**, not your arms. Think about pulling your elbows down toward your hips rather than yanking the handles with your biceps (OnlyGains.ai).
- Simultaneously **hinge at the hips**, driving your weight slightly back. The hip hinge generates the majority of your power—your arms are merely transmitting force.
- Pull the handles down past your thighs in a smooth arc.
- Keep your core braced throughout to maintain power transfer from upper body to handles.

**The Recovery Phase:**
- Allow arms to rise naturally with the handles.
- Return to a standing position with controlled momentum.
- Don't rush—let the flywheel do some work on the return.
- Reset at the top before initiating the next stroke.

**Breathing Rhythm:**
Adopt one breath cycle per stroke. Exhale forcefully on the pull (as you hinge down), inhale on the recovery (as you stand back up). Establish this pattern within the first 10 strokes and maintain it throughout. Holding your breath is one of the fastest ways to spike heart rate unnecessarily (OnlyGains.ai).

**Stroke Rate:**
Target approximately **30–35 strokes per minute** at race pace. Long, powerful strokes beat short, frantic ones. Quality over quantity—each stroke should feel like a controlled, powerful movement rather than rapid arm-flailing.

### Common Efficiency Mistakes and How to Fix Them

1. **Arms-first pulling:** Athletes yank the handles with biceps/shoulders instead of engaging lats and hip hinge. **Fix:** Cue "elbows to hips" and think of a deadlift motion. The arms connect; the hips power.

2. **Starting too fast:** Sprinting the first 200m at max effort and dying by 500m. **Fix:** Remember this is Station 1 of 8. Start at 70–75% effort and build. Target a negative split—faster second half than first (OnlyGains.ai).

3. **Standing too tall:** Not hinging at the hips, losing power from the core and posterior chain. **Fix:** Exaggerate the hip hinge. Your torso should reach roughly 45° of forward lean at the bottom of each stroke.

4. **Choppy, short strokes:** Rapid abbreviated pulls generating minimal power per stroke. **Fix:** Slow down, extend the range of motion, and aim for 30–35 SPM, not 45+.

5. **Holding your breath:** Causes early fatigue and heart rate spikes. **Fix:** Conscious, rhythmic breathing—one breath cycle per stroke, established in the first few reps.

### Target Times by Performance Level

| Level | 1000m Time (Isolated) | Pace/500m | In-Race Estimate (+10–20%) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Elite (Pro Division) | Under 3:00 | Under 1:30 | 3:30–4:20 |
| Advanced | 3:00–3:30 | 1:30–1:45 | 3:30–4:15 |
| Intermediate | 3:30–4:15 | 1:45–2:07 | 4:15–5:00 |
| Beginner | 4:15–5:00 | 2:07–2:30 | 5:00–6:00 |
| First-Timer | 5:00+ | 2:30+ | 6:00+ |

*Data from OnlyGains.ai and competitive.fit. Elite male race averages: ~4:25; average male HYROX finisher: ~6:19 (competitive.fit). Elite Pro men have recorded sub-3:50 in race conditions. Rox Lyfe elite Pro data shows median of 3:47 for top-15 men.*

### Pacing Strategy

- **0–300m (70–75% effort):** Let heart rate settle from the run. Splits around 1:55–2:05/500m.
- **300–700m (80–85% effort):** Find sustainable race rhythm. Splits around 1:50–2:00/500m.
- **700–1000m (90%+ effort):** Push knowing you're finishing soon. Splits around 1:45–1:55/500m.

Don't stare at the monitor constantly—check every 250m (OnlyGains.ai).

### Muscle Groups Taxed and Impact on Subsequent Run

**Primary:** Latissimus dorsi, posterior deltoids, triceps, core (rectus abdominis, obliques), hip extensors (glutes, hamstrings).
**Secondary:** Forearm flexors (grip on handles), erector spinae.

**Carryover to Run 2:** The SkiErg primarily taxes the upper body and core, with moderate hip flexor/extensor fatigue from the hinge pattern. Most athletes find their legs relatively fresh for Run 2, but their heart rate and breathing can be elevated. The key is managing effort so cardiovascular stress doesn't tank your second run pace.

### Training Benchmarks and Drills

- **Pacing Practice:** 4 × 500m SkiErg, 2 min rest. Goal: hit the same split (within 3 sec) on all four rounds.
- **Race Simulation:** 1km run → 1000m SkiErg → 1km run. Track transition times.
- **Endurance Builder:** 2000m SkiErg at conversational pace, every 500m do 10 push-ups.
- **Interval Power:** 8 × 250m SkiErg, 1:1 work:rest, build speed each round (OnlyGains.ai).

## Station 2: Sled Push (4 × 12.5m = 50m Total)

The sled push is the first truly heavy strength station. Weights are significant: **Women Open 102kg, Men Open/Women Pro 152kg, Men Pro 202kg** (all including sled weight). The Hyrox competition carpet creates substantially more friction than typical gym floors, meaning the sled feels heavier than athletes expect. This station has one of the highest time variabilities and can easily cost several minutes if technique is poor.

### Optimal Body Angle, Arm Position, Foot Placement, and Driving Technique

**Body Angle:** Achieve a **45-degree lean** with hips below shoulders. This creates a horizontal force vector, pushing the sled forward rather than down into the carpet. When you stand too tall, gravity works against you—you push down into the floor, creating more friction (HyroxTrainingPlans.com).

**Arm Position:** Elbows bent at **90–120 degrees**. Arms act as connectors, not pushers. Your legs generate 4× more power than your shoulders. Straight, locked-out arms force deltoids and triceps to engage heavily—they fatigue fast. Bent arms transmit leg power to the sled (HyroxTrainingPlans.com).

**Hand Position:** Hands shoulder-width apart, firm grip but not a death grip (save forearm energy for sled pull and later stations).

**Foot Placement:** Take **rapid 6–8 inch steps** maintaining 120+ steps per minute cadence. Long strides create a stop-start pattern—you decelerate between steps. Short, rapid steps maintain constant forward pressure (HyroxTrainingPlans.com).

**Starting Position:** Set your position BEFORE the first push—already at 45° angle, hands placed, core braced. The first 3 steps are the hardest (breaking static friction). Starting from standing wastes the crucial first push.

**Head Position:** Neutral, eyes 6 feet ahead on the ground. Don't look up—it pulls you into an upright position.

### Continuous Push vs. Reset Between Lengths

The 50m is split into 4 × 12.5m legs with turns. At the turn, you must reposition. **Elite athletes minimize time at turns** by maintaining sled contact and immediately resetting body angle. The sled stops at each turn regardless, so the key is minimizing the time between the sled stopping and your next push beginning. Pre-set your body angle before driving again. Don't stand up fully at the turns—stay low, reposition your feet, and go.

### Common Mistakes

1. **Standing too upright:** Pushes force downward into carpet instead of horizontally. **Fix:** 45-degree lean, hips below shoulders.
2. **Locked arms / pushing from shoulders:** Treats the sled like a bench press. **Fix:** Bend elbows 90–120°, let legs drive.
3. **Long strides:** Creates stop-start pattern, losing momentum. **Fix:** Short, rapid 6–8 inch steps.
4. **Not using legs:** Upper body pushing instead of leg driving. **Fix:** Think "sprinter stance"—power comes from quads, glutes, and calves.
5. **Grip too tight:** Burns forearms needed for sled pull. **Fix:** Firm but relaxed grip—the sled isn't going anywhere.
6. **Wrong starting position:** Standing then leaning in. **Fix:** Set 45° position before first push.

### Target Times by Performance Level

| Level | Men (152kg) | Women (102kg) |
|---|---|---|
| Elite | 2:30–3:00 | 2:30–3:00 |
| Advanced | 3:00–3:30 | 3:00–3:25 |
| Intermediate | 3:30–4:30 | 3:30–4:30 |
| Beginner/Recreational | 4:30–6:00+ | 4:30–6:00+ |

*Elite data from HyroxDataLab: men 2:50–3:26, women 2:50–3:25. Rox Lyfe Pro elite median: men 2:45, women 3:00. Average HYROX finisher: men ~3:54, women ~4:13 (competitive.fit).*

### Muscle Groups Taxed and Carryover to Next Run

**Primary:** Quadriceps, glutes, calves, core (anti-extension).
**Secondary:** Deltoids, triceps, erector spinae.

**Carryover to Run 3:** The sled push is heavily quad-dominant. Athletes often experience significant quad burn and elevated heart rate entering Run 3. The first 200–400m of the subsequent run typically feels sluggish. Training "compromised running" (running immediately after sled work) is critical. Expect Run 3 pace to be 10–20 seconds/km slower than Run 1.

### Training Progressions

- **Weeks 1–2 (Technique Focus):** 50% race weight, 4–5 sets of 25m, 2 min rest. Focus on body angle + arm position.
- **Weeks 3–4 (Progressive Load):** 70–100% race weight, 4–5 sets of 25m. Combine multiple technique cues.
- **Weeks 5–8 (Race Specificity):** Full race weight, 4 × 12.5m (race format). Add 500m run before each set.
- **Speed Work:** Lighter weight (60%), focus on maximizing step cadence.
- **Overload:** 110–120% race weight for shorter distances (2 × 12.5m) to build strength reserve.

*Note: Gym floors are almost always smoother than Hyrox carpet. Add 20–35kg to match race-day feel (Rox Lyfe recommendation).*

---

## Station 3: Sled Pull (4 × 12.5m = 50m Total)

The sled pull is one of the most time-variable stations in Hyrox and the area where average athletes lose the most time relative to elites. Rox Lyfe data shows **elite Pro men at ~3:14 median vs. average Pro men at 6:31—a 3:17 gap**, the largest of any station. Weights: **Women Open 78kg, Men Open/Women Pro 103kg, Men Pro 153kg** (including sled).

### Hand-Over-Hand Technique vs. Hip Extension vs. Walk-Back

Three primary techniques exist (TheProgrm, Hybrid Athlete Club):

1. **Hand-Over-Hand (Arms Only):** Stand relatively upright, pull the rope hand over hand using biceps and back. Short, choppy pulls keep the sled moving. Best for athletes with **strong upper bodies** but can fatigue arms quickly. More suited to lighter sled weights (Open Women).

2. **Hip Extension Method:** Grab the rope with arms nearly fully extended, then explosively extend hips (like a kettlebell swing/deadlift) while pulling through with arms. The hip extension creates inertia that the arms can then finish. **Most efficient for heavier weights** as it recruits the entire posterior chain. This is the preferred technique for most competitive athletes.

3. **Walk-Back Method:** Hold the rope and physically walk backward in the small ~1.8m athlete box, using body weight and leg drive. Effective but space-limited—you can only take 2–3 steps before hitting the boundary line.

4. **Combination (Recommended for most):** Initiate with hip extension, finish with arm pull, and incorporate small backward steps. This distributes work across the most muscle groups and is the most sustainable over 50m.

### Rope Management and Grip Strategies

- **Take the slack out first:** The Hyrox rope is the full 12.5m length and has slight elasticity. Before your first pull, grab and tension the rope so the first real pull moves the sled immediately (Hybrid Athlete Club).
- **Manage rope pile:** As you pull, rope accumulates behind/around you. Be deliberate about where it falls to avoid tripping—a common race-day disaster (Rox Lyfe).
- **Grip:** Use a firm but not death-grip hold. Chalk is permitted and strongly recommended. Alternate which hand leads if using hand-over-hand to distribute fatigue.
- **Stay in your box:** Athletes must not step on the solid white line at the end of the athlete's box—penalties apply.

### Common Mistakes and Fixes

1. **Long, sweeping arm pulls:** Wastes energy and creates a stop-start pattern. **Fix:** Short, quick, choppy pulls to maintain sled momentum.
2. **Not using hips/legs:** Pulling purely with arms. **Fix:** Lean back and drive hips, using body weight as leverage.
3. **Tripping on rope:** Rope piles behind feet. **Fix:** Practice rope management; step to the side of the pile, not on it.
4. **Letting sled stop between pulls:** Static friction is much greater than kinetic friction. **Fix:** Keep pulls rapid enough that the sled never fully stops.
5. **Underestimating the friction:** The Hyrox carpet makes sleds feel dramatically heavier than gym training. **Fix:** Train with added weight to simulate race-day friction (Rox Lyfe suggests +35kg on typical gym floors).

### Target Times by Performance Level

| Level | Men (103kg Open / 153kg Pro) | Women (78kg Open / 103kg Pro) |
|---|---|---|
| Elite | 3:00–3:50 | 3:30–4:15 |
| Advanced | 3:50–4:45 | 4:15–5:00 |
| Intermediate | 4:45–6:00 | 5:00–7:00 |
| Beginner/Recreational | 6:00–8:00+ | 7:00–9:00+ |

*HyroxDataLab elite: men 3:50–4:37, women 4:15–4:59. Average HYROX finisher: men ~6:12, women ~7:03 (competitive.fit). Rox Lyfe Pro elite median: men 3:14, women 3:54.*

### Muscle Groups Taxed and Carryover to Next Run

**Primary:** Biceps, forearm flexors (grip), latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, posterior deltoids, glutes, hamstrings (hip extension), erector spinae.
**Secondary:** Quadriceps (walk-back method), core (anti-flexion).

**Carryover to Run 4:** The sled pull hammers grip, biceps, and posterior chain. Forearm fatigue begins accumulating here and won't fully recover before farmers carry (Station 6). The posterior chain work can make the subsequent run feel surprisingly okay for the legs, but upper body tightness and elevated heart rate are common. The grip fatigue created here has a long tail effect across the remaining race.

---

## Station 4: Burpee Broad Jumps (80m)

This is widely regarded as **the most systemically fatiguing station** in Hyrox. It combines a full chest-to-ground burpee with a forward broad jump, repeated over 80 meters. Most athletes need **40–60 reps** to cover the distance, depending on jump length. It comes after 4km of running and three strength stations, and the physiological demand is enormous—full-body muscular work combined with repeated impact and cardiovascular stress.

### Optimal Technique

**The Burpee Portion:**
- Chest MUST touch the ground. Hands must be placed no more than 30cm in front of feet.
- **Step-up method (recommended):** Step one leg up at a time after the chest-to-ground position. This is what most top athletes use because it conserves energy and keeps heart rate lower. Hyrox coach Meg Jacobi confirms: *"Use the step-up method to conserve energy and keep your heart rate lower. Maintaining steady movement with fewer breaks will yield a better time overall"* (Centr).
- **Jump-up method:** Both feet jump forward simultaneously. Faster per rep, but dramatically spikes heart rate and is unsustainable for most over 80m.
- Feet must be parallel on takeoff and landing—no staggered takeoffs.

**The Broad Jump Portion:**
- Jump **forward**, not up. Vertical height is wasted energy that doesn't count toward the 80m.
- Moderate jump distance (1.3–2.0m per rep) is more sustainable than maximum-effort jumps. If your max broad jump is 2.5m, aim for 1.5–1.8m per rep. This conserves leg power dramatically.
- Land softly with bent knees to absorb impact and reduce cumulative joint stress.

**Efficiency of Movement:**
- Minimize the transition between landing and going down for the next burpee. The faster you establish a rhythm (land → hands down → chest down → step up → jump), the better.
- No forward steps between reps are allowed.

### Pacing Strategy

**Steady tempo is king.** Rox Lyfe, Centr, and virtually every experienced Hyrox coach emphasize consistent pacing over a push-and-rest strategy. Going fast for 20m then resting 30 seconds is far worse than maintaining a sustainable rhythm throughout.

- **Know your rep count:** Before race day, measure how many BBJs it takes you to cover 80m. If it takes 50 reps, break it into mental chunks (5 groups of 10, or 10 groups of 5).
- **RPE target:** 7–8/10. You should feel like you're working hard but could sustain the pace for the full distance.
- **If you must rest:** Rest lying chest-down on the floor, not standing. Heart rate lowers faster when lying down (Rox Lyfe). Short 5–10 second rests are better than one long 30-second break.

### Common Mistakes

1. **Jumping too high (not forward):** Wastes energy without gaining distance. **Fix:** Think "long jump" not "high jump." Focus on forward distance.
2. **Inefficient get-ups:** Struggling to stand from chest-to-ground. **Fix:** Practice the step-up: plant one foot close to your hands, drive up with that leg.
3. **Starting too fast:** Going all-out for the first 20m, then crashing. **Fix:** Set a metronome-like rhythm from rep 1. Aim for the same effort on rep 1 and rep 50.
4. **Too-long jumps:** Max-effort jumps fatigue quads and spike heart rate. **Fix:** Use 60–70% of your max jump distance.
5. **Hands too far from feet:** Placing hands far forward before the burpee wastes distance and energy. **Fix:** Hands placed no more than 30cm in front of feet (this is also the rule).

### Target Times by Performance Level

| Level | Men | Women |
|---|---|---|
| Elite (Pro) | 2:21–4:00 | 3:11–5:15 |
| Advanced | 4:00–5:00 | 5:00–6:00 |
| Intermediate | 5:00–6:30 | 6:00–7:30 |
| Beginner/Recreational | 6:30–9:00+ | 7:30–10:00+ |

*HyroxDataLab elite: men 4:00–4:37, women 5:15–5:57. Average HYROX finisher: ~5:23 for both genders (competitive.fit). Rox Lyfe Pro elite median: men 2:21, women 3:11—note these are the absolute best in the world. 2026 average Men's Open: 5:45, Women's Open: 7:09 (hyroxy.com/TheRoxZone data).*

### Muscle Groups Taxed

**Primary:** Quadriceps (jumping, standing), chest/pectorals (lowering to ground), hip flexors, glutes, hamstrings.
**Secondary:** Triceps (push-up portion), shoulders, core (stabilization), calves.
**Systemic:** This is the station that creates the highest cardiovascular demand. Heart rate will reach near-maximal levels. It taxes both the aerobic and anaerobic systems heavily.

**Carryover to Run 5:** Run 5 (after BBJ) is often the slowest run of the race. Legs are heavy from jumping, heart rate is elevated, and there's a psychological weight of knowing you're only halfway through. Elite athletes manage compromised running here; recreational athletes often walk portions of Run 5. Training compromised running after BBJ sets is essential.

---

## Station 5: Rowing (1000m)

The rowing station is the **only station where you sit down** in the entire Hyrox race. It comes at the race's midpoint—after five 1km runs and four functional stations. Smart athletes treat it as tactical recovery. Foolish athletes either waste it by going too easy (5+ minutes) or blow up by sprinting it and imploding during the farmer's carry. The Concept2 RowErg is the machine used at all events.

### Optimal Technique: Drive Sequence, Stroke Rate, Damper Setting

**The Drive Sequence (Power Phase):**
The rowing stroke is **85% legs, 10% core, 5% arms** (OnlyGains.ai). The sequence is always: **Legs → Back → Arms.**

1. **The Catch (start):** Shins vertical, knees bent, arms extended, shoulders forward, core engaged, back straight.
2. **Leg drive:** Push with your legs FIRST. The handle doesn't move until your legs extend.
3. **Back swing:** Once legs are almost straight, lean back slightly (to 1 o'clock position).
4. **Arm pull:** Pull handle to lower chest as the final motion.

**The Recovery (Return):**
Reverse sequence: **Arms → Back → Legs.**
- Arms extend first, body rocks forward, then legs bend last as you slide back.
- Recovery should take **twice as long as the drive**. This is your micro-rest.

**Stroke Rate:** Target **24–28 strokes per minute**. Below 22 SPM you're leaving time on the table; above 32 SPM you're likely getting sloppy and wasting energy. Stronger/more powerful athletes can use a lower stroke rate with more power per stroke; more aerobic athletes may prefer 26–28 SPM (Rox Lyfe).

**Damper Setting:** The damper is preset by division: Women = 5, Women Pro/Men = 6, Men Pro = 7. Athletes can adjust. **Optimal range is 4–6 for most athletes.** The damper controls airflow to the flywheel, not "resistance" in the traditional sense. Higher settings fatigue muscles faster without improving speed. Recommended drag factors: ~130–135 for women, ~145 for men/women pro, ~165 for men pro (John Steventon via Rox Lyfe). Set your drag factor in training to match race conditions.

### Pacing: Even Split vs. Negative Split

**Negative split is the gold standard.** Start conservative, finish fast.

| Strategy | 0–250m | 250–500m | 500–750m | 750–1000m | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Conservative ("Recovery") | 2:05–2:10 | 2:05–2:10 | 2:00–2:05 | 1:55–2:00 | ~4:00–4:15 |
| Steady State ("Time Saver") | 1:55–2:00 | 1:50–1:55 | 1:50–1:55 | 1:45–1:50 | ~3:40–3:50 |
| Aggressive ("Send It") | 1:45–1:50 | 1:42–1:47 | 1:42–1:47 | 1:40–1:45 | ~3:20–3:30 |

*Pacing data from OnlyGains.ai.*

**Rox Lyfe's wisdom:** Going 15–20 seconds slower than your absolute max 1000m row saves enormous energy and "costs" only seconds in context of a 75–100 minute race—but likely saves minutes on subsequent stations.

**Hyrox-specific consideration:** Because your legs are heavily fatigued by Station 5 and you still need them for farmers carry, sandbag lunges, and wall balls, some athletes intentionally bias slightly more toward upper body pulling and less extreme leg drive than a pure rower would. This preserves quad/glute capacity for the race's second half (Rox Lyfe).

### Common Mistakes

1. **Pulling with arms first:** Loses the most powerful part of the stroke (legs). **Fix:** Cue "Legs. Back. Arms." Say it out loud during training.
2. **Damper too high:** Setting to 10 thinking it's harder = faster. **Fix:** Use 4–6. It's not a resistance dial.
3. **Rushing the recovery:** Sliding forward at the same speed as the drive. **Fix:** 2:1 recovery-to-drive ratio. Slow slide forward, explosive drive back.
4. **Hunching forward:** Rounds back at the catch, straining lower back. **Fix:** Chest proud, engage lats.
5. **Death grip on handle:** Fries already-fatigued forearms. **Fix:** Loose hook grip—fingers over handle, relaxed.
6. **Pulling to chin:** Handle finishes at neck level. **Fix:** Handle to lower chest/upper stomach. Elbows pull back, not up.

### Target Times by Performance Level

| Level | 1000m Time (Isolated) | Pace/500m | In-Race Estimate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Elite | Under 3:10 | Under 1:35 | 3:30–4:33 |
| Advanced | 3:10–3:40 | 1:35–1:50 | 3:40–4:15 |
| Intermediate | 3:40–4:15 | 1:50–2:07 | 4:15–5:00 |
| Beginner | 4:15–5:00 | 2:07–2:30 | 5:00–6:00 |

*HyroxDataLab elite: men 4:00–4:33, women 4:45–5:11. Average HYROX finisher: men ~6:30, women ~7:06 (competitive.fit). Rox Lyfe elite Pro median: men 3:58, women 4:29.*

### Muscle Groups Taxed and Carryover to Next Run

**Primary:** Quadriceps (leg drive), glutes (hip extension), latissimus dorsi (pull), hamstrings.
**Secondary:** Biceps, forearms, core, erector spinae, calves.

**Carryover to Run 6:** The row, when paced correctly, should **lower** your heart rate relative to the burpee broad jumps. Run 6 can actually feel relatively good if you used the row strategically. However, if you over-row, quads and grip will be compromised heading into the farmer's carry.

### Training Drills

- **Pacing Practice:** 4 × 500m, 2 min rest. Negative split each piece AND the overall set.
- **Stroke Rate Cap:** 5 × 500m at 22 SPM cap. Forces leg drive efficiency.
- **Race Simulation:** 1km run → 80m BBJ → 1km run → 1000m row → 1km run → 200m farmer's carry.
- **Endurance:** 3000m row, every 500m get off for 10 push-ups. Maintain consistent split despite interruptions (OnlyGains.ai).

---

## Station 6: Farmers Carry (200m)

The farmers carry is the most deceptive station in Hyrox. It looks simple—pick up two kettlebells and walk 200 meters. But after six runs and five brutal stations, it becomes a test of grip endurance, postural integrity, and mental toughness. Weights: **Women Open 2×16kg, Men Open/Women Pro 2×24kg, Men Pro 2×32kg.** You may put the kettlebells down without penalty, but every drop costs time.

### Grip Strategies

**Chalk:** Use it. It's permitted and makes a significant difference, especially if your hands are sweaty from previous stations.

**Hook grip:** Some athletes use a hook-style grip (thumb wrapped under fingers) for added security. Test this in training—it can be uncomfortable but reduces the chance of the kettlebell slipping.

**Forearm endurance:** Grip is important but, according to Dr. Adam Storey (HYROX Sports Science Advisory Council member, via Rox Lyfe podcast), the farmer's carry is better classified as a **"postural endurance test."** When athletes start failing, it's usually the upper back and shoulders that collapse first, not the hands. Once posture goes, grip fatigue accelerates because the kettlebells hang in a mechanically disadvantaged position.

**Training grip specifically:** Dead hangs, heavy holds, farmer's carries at heavier-than-race weight over shorter distances (60–80m), and pull-ups all build grip capacity.

### Walking Pace and Stride Length Optimization

- **Walk as fast as possible.** Rox Lyfe's recommendation: complete this station as quickly as you possibly can. The longer you hold the kettlebells, the more they tax you. A 90-second carry is dramatically less fatiguing than a 3-minute carry—it's not linear.
- **Stride length:** Moderate, brisk strides—not running, but aggressive walking. Overly long strides can create trunk sway that wastes energy.
- **Posture:** Shoulders retracted, chest up, tall spine. Think "military posture." The trap complex (upper/mid/lower traps) stabilizes the shoulders under load. If scapular control is lost and shoulders drift forward, the kettlebells feel heavier and grip fatigue accelerates (Dr. Adam Storey, Rox Lyfe podcast).

### When to Set Down vs. Push Through

- **Elite strategy:** Complete 200m unbroken. Period.
- **Competitive strategy:** One planned rest at 100m if needed. Set down for no more than 5–10 seconds—shake hands, reset grip, go.
- **Recreational strategy:** Rest every 50–75m. Use the "traffic light" approach—when grip feels like it's about to fail (yellow light), set down immediately BEFORE you drop them (red light). Picking up from a drop is harder than a planned set-down.
- **Key insight:** Short, frequent rests beat pushing to failure and needing a long recovery. If you carry for 150m then drop with fried forearms, you might need 20–30 seconds to recover. Two brief 5-second pauses at 75m and 150m would have been faster overall.

### Common Mistakes

1. **Rushing and dropping:** Going too fast, losing grip, then needing extended recovery. **Fix:** Find a fast but sustainable pace with planned rest points.
2. **Poor posture:** Shoulders rounded, upper back collapsed, trunk swaying. **Fix:** Retract shoulder blades, brace core, stand tall. Train upper back strength (barbell rows, shrugs, RDLs).
3. **Death grip from the start:** Squeezing maximally from meter 1. **Fix:** Firm but not maximum grip—gradually increase squeeze as fatigue builds.
4. **Looking down:** Drops chest and encourages shoulder rounding. **Fix:** Eyes forward, chin level.

### How Grip Fatigue Affects Remaining Stations

This is a critical strategic consideration. After the farmer's carry, you still face:
- **Sandbag Lunges (Station 7):** Holding a 10–30kg sandbag on your shoulders. Dropping the sandbag incurs a **5-second penalty** on the first drop and **disqualification** on the second. Fatigued forearms/grip from the carry can make holding the sandbag brutal.
- **Wall Balls (Station 8):** Holding and throwing a 4–9kg ball 100 times. Shoulder and forearm fatigue from the carry directly impacts wall ball performance.

**Implication:** Don't over-grip the farmer's carry at the expense of the final two stations. Manage grip fatigue as a resource across Stations 6, 7, and 8.

---

## Station 7: Sandbag Lunges (100m)

Sandbag lunges are the seventh station and come brutally late in the race—after 7km of running and six functional stations. Weights: **Women Open 10kg, Men Open/Women Pro 20kg, Men Pro 30kg.** The sandbag must remain on both shoulders at ALL times. Dropping the bag incurs a 5-second penalty; a second drop results in **disqualification.** This station shows one of the **highest time variabilities** of any station—HyroxDataLab found 87–88 seconds of variance between athletes in the same finish-time bracket, making it a high-leverage training target.

### Front-Loaded vs. Shoulder-Carry Position

The sandbag is positioned **across both shoulders** (a yoke-style carry). Key positioning:
- **HIGH on traps, NOT low on shoulders.** Position the sandbag securely on the upper trapezius muscles, almost behind the neck.
- Grip the bag firmly with both hands/forearms to prevent sliding.
- Maintain a tall, upright torso. If your trunk collapses under the sandbag, every step costs more metabolically (Rox Lyfe).
- Some athletes prefer a more "front rack" style hold—sandbag resting on upper chest and anterior deltoids. This shifts load to the quads more but can be easier to manage the bag. Experiment in training.

The HyroxDataLab analysis recommends positioning the bag to enable a more **posterior chain–dominant lunge** (longer steps, slight forward lean) rather than a quad-dominant pattern (short steps, very upright torso). This preserves quadriceps for wall balls.

### Step Length and Tempo Optimization

**The Sweet Spot: 0.9–1.1m steps (HyroxDataLab data analysis):**
- **Men (targeting 1:30 finish):** 100–110 total steps, step length 0.9–1.0m, expected time 4:30–5:30.
- **Women (targeting 1:30 finish):** 110–120 total steps, step length 0.85–0.95m, expected time 4:00–5:00.

**Why not shorter steps?** Short steps (0.7m, ~140 total steps) are quad-dominant and destroy your quads before wall balls. HyroxDataLab found a **r = 0.738 correlation** between lunge technique and wall ball performance—athletes who went quad-dominant on lunges averaged 75 seconds slower on wall balls.

**Why not longer steps?** Excessively long steps (>1.2m) create balance issues, slow tempo, and increase injury risk on fatigued legs.

**Tempo:** Aim for continuous "touch-and-go" lunges—rear knee touches ground, immediately drive up into the next step. Avoid pausing in the standing position between reps. Set a metronome-like rhythm within the first 3 steps and maintain it.

### Breathing Pattern During Lunges

- **Inhale** as you lower into the lunge (eccentric phase).
- **Exhale** as you drive up (concentric phase).
- Alternatively, some athletes prefer exhaling at the bottom of the lunge to engage core bracing, then inhaling during the transition. Test both approaches in training.
- The key is consistency—irregular breathing under a loaded sandbag creates core instability and wastes energy.

### Common Mistakes

1. **Too-long steps:** Causes balance issues and slows tempo. **Fix:** Target 0.9–1.1m per step.
2. **Losing balance / lateral drift:** Lunging offline wastes distance. **Fix:** Maintain a ~30cm foot-width between left and right feet (not lunging on a tightrope). Follow the centerline of the lane.
3. **Poor posture / folding forward:** Trunk collapses under sandbag, increasing metabolic cost. **Fix:** Chest up, squeeze shoulder blades, strong upper back. Train front rack holds and Zercher carries.
4. **Dropping the sandbag:** First drop = 5-second penalty. Second drop = DQ. **Fix:** Secure grip before starting; train holding the bag under fatigue. Forearm endurance from farmer's carry training pays dividends here.
5. **Quad-dominant lunges (short steps, very upright):** Destroys quads before wall balls. **Fix:** Slightly longer steps with controlled forward lean to recruit glutes/hamstrings.
6. **Resting between reps in standing position:** Standing pauses add up significantly over 100m. **Fix:** Touch-and-go rhythm—knee touches, immediately drive into next step.

### Target Times by Performance Level

| Level | Men (20kg / 30kg Pro) | Women (10kg / 20kg Pro) |
|---|---|---|
| Elite | 3:00–4:00 | 3:30–4:30 |
| Advanced | 4:00–4:45 | 4:00–4:30 |
| Intermediate | 4:45–6:00 | 4:30–5:30 |
| Beginner/Recreational | 6:00–8:00+ | 5:30–7:00+ |

*HyroxDataLab elite: men 3:50–4:24, women 4:00–4:30. HyroxDataLab median for 1:27–1:33 finishers: men 5:18, women 4:39. Average HYROX finisher: men ~5:35, women ~5:27 (competitive.fit). Rox Lyfe Pro elite median: men 3:03, women 3:35.*

### Quad and Glute Fatigue Management Heading into Wall Balls

The lunge-to-wall-ball connection is the most important inter-station relationship in the second half of Hyrox. HyroxDataLab's analysis found:
- Athletes using **posterior chain–dominant lunges** (longer steps, glute/hamstring emphasis) performed wall balls an average of **75 seconds faster** than athletes who used short, quad-dominant steps.
- **Practical example:** Athlete A: 140 short steps (0.7m) → quad-dominant → wall balls at 7:30. Athlete B: 100 longer steps (1.0m) → posterior chain emphasis → wall balls at 6:15.

**During Run 8 (after lunges, before wall balls):** Shake out quads during the run. Use dynamic muscle relaxation—consciously relax quad muscles during each stride's swing phase. Mental prep: "My quads are preserved. Wall balls will be hard but I'm ready."

---

## Station 8: Wall Balls (100 Reps — All Divisions)

The final station. The last obstacle between you and the finish line. 100 reps of wall balls—a full-depth squat into an explosive overhead throw—after 8km of running and 7 other functional stations. Weights: **Women Open 4kg to 9ft target (2.7m), Women Pro 6kg to 9ft, Men Open 6kg to 10ft target (3m), Men Pro 9kg to 10ft.** This station has one of the largest time variabilities (Rox Lyfe data shows a 3:13 gap between elite and average Pro men) and is where races are won or lost.

### Optimal Technique

**Setup:**
- Stand facing the target with feet **shoulder-width apart** (or slightly wider for a stable base and deeper squat).
- Position yourself approximately **one arm's length from the wall/rig**.
- Hold the ball at chest height with elbows tucked. Thumbs behind/under the ball.
- Eyes on the target to maintain upright posture.

**The Squat:**
- Initiate with a full-depth squat—**hips must descend below knees** (below parallel). A box is placed behind you at most events; the judge checks that you make contact with it each rep. Shallow squats result in **no-reps**, which are devastating at this stage.
- Drive up through heels, extending hips and knees explosively.
- Maintain neutral spine throughout. Don't let the ball pull you forward.
- Widen your stance if needed—a wider stance allows for deeper squats with less ankle mobility demand.

**The Throw:**
- Use the **momentum from your squat drive** to power the throw. The ball should leave your hands as your legs reach full extension.
- Some athletes add a slight **heel raise (calf raise) at the top** for extra power—this is a personal preference that Rox Lyfe recommends testing in training.
- Don't over-throw. Aim for the ball to **just** hit the target. Throwing excessively high wastes arm and shoulder energy.
- Keep the ball **close to your body** throughout. Holding it away from your chest puts extra load on shoulders.

**The Catch and Cycle:**
- Catch the ball on its descent and **immediately begin squatting** as you absorb the ball. Don't catch with straight legs and then start squatting—that's two separate movements instead of one.
- This "catch-and-squat" technique dramatically improves efficiency and cycle time (George Edwards, HYROX coach).
- If the ball falls, you must stand tall with hips and knees extended before starting the next rep—you cannot catch a bounced ball and continue.

### Break Strategy: What's Optimal by Fitness Level

This is one of the most common coaching queries: "How should I break up wall balls?"

**Elite/Unbroken (Target: <5:30):**
- 100 reps unbroken. Requires exceptional fitness and specific training. Only viable for athletes who can complete 100 unbroken reps in training under fatigue.

**Competitive/Large Sets (Target: 5:30–7:00):**
- Sets of 25–25–25–25 with 5–10 second rests. Or 30–30–20–20.
- Rest is brief and **planned before failure**. Set the ball down, shake arms, 3–5 deep breaths, pick up and go.

**Intermediate/Medium Sets (Target: 7:00–9:00):**
- Sets of 15–20 with 10–15 second rests.
- Centr (official Hyrox equipment provider) recommends: **25–15–10–5** descending pattern, staying sharp with form.
- Alternative: Sets of 10 with very short rests (5 seconds). This keeps you moving and avoids the psychological challenge of staring down 25+ reps.

**Beginner/Small Sets (Target: 9:00+):**
- Sets of 10 with 15–20 second rests.
- Or sets of 5 if needed—just keep moving.
- Key principle: **Don't go to failure.** If you can do 15 unbroken, break at 10. Failed reps (ball slipping, no-reps) cost far more time than planned rests.

**Critical insight from Rox Lyfe:** "Many people make the mistake of doing as many as they can at the start, but end up needing to take a lot of rest between sets after that initial blast. Instead, more frequent, but very quick rests, may help your overall time." Start conservatively and finish strong. With race adrenaline, you may find you can push through those final 20 reps without the planned rest.

### Breathing Rhythm and Pacing

- **Breathe in** at the bottom of the squat (this happens somewhat naturally).
- **Breathe out** at the top of the rep as you release the ball.
- One breath per rep is the target rhythm.
- If doing large sets (25+), you may need to add a second breath cycle: inhale on the way down, exhale at the bottom, inhale on the way up, exhale on release. Find what works in training.

**Cadence matters:** The speed at which you drop into the squat and drive back up (your "cycle time") makes an enormous difference over 100 reps. An elite athlete completing each rep in 3 seconds finishes in 5:00. A recreational athlete at 5 seconds per rep (plus rests) takes 9–10 minutes. Practice increasing cadence specifically.

### Common Mistakes

1. **Shallow squats (no-reps):** The single most devastating mistake. Each no-rep costs you the energy of the rep PLUS the rep doesn't count. **Fix:** Practice squat depth obsessively. Use the box touch cue. Go slightly deeper than required to build a margin.
2. **Throwing too high:** Wastes arm and shoulder energy. **Fix:** Aim to just hit the target. Accuracy over power.
3. **Ball too far from body:** Holding the ball away from your chest during the squat. **Fix:** Keep elbows tucked, ball at chest.
4. **Catching with straight legs then squatting:** Two movements instead of one. **Fix:** Begin squatting as you catch—absorb and descend simultaneously.
5. **Taking too long between sets:** Long rests cool the muscles and make restarting harder. **Fix:** Planned, brief rests (5–10 seconds max). Set the ball down, shake arms, pick up.
6. **Ego pacing:** Going for a big unbroken set to start and blowing up. **Fix:** Start with conservative sets and assess how you feel. You can always go bigger on the final set.

### Target Times by Performance Level

| Level | Men (6kg/9kg Pro, 10ft) | Women (4kg/6kg Pro, 9ft) |
|---|---|---|
| Elite | 4:25–5:30 | 3:50–5:20 |
| Advanced | 5:30–6:30 | 5:20–6:00 |
| Intermediate | 6:30–8:00 | 6:00–7:30 |
| Beginner/Recreational | 8:00–10:00+ | 7:30–10:00+ |

*HyroxDataLab elite: men 5:30–6:04, women 5:20–5:53. Average HYROX finisher: men ~7:08, women ~7:20 (competitive.fit). Rox Lyfe Pro elite median: men 4:25, women 3:50.*

### Mentality and Finishing Strategies

**This is the LAST station.** Everything you've saved, everything you've reserved—spend it now.

- **Empty the tank:** Rox Lyfe states: *"By the time you reach the wall balls your tank will likely be almost empty, and you should use the wall balls to fully empty it!"* There's nothing after this except the finish line sprint.
- **Count down, not up:** Mentally, counting from 100 to 0 is more motivating than 0 to 100. "Only 30 left" hits different than "I've done 70."
- **Break it into micro-goals:** Don't think about 100. Think about the next 10. Then the next 10.
- **Crowd energy:** The wall ball station is typically near the finish area and spectators can see you. Feed off that energy in the final 20–30 reps.
- **The final kick:** From about 5 minutes before the finish (roughly the wall ball station for competitive athletes), go into full "race kick" mode. This is where the HYROX version of a "finishing sprint" happens—on wall balls, not on the track.
- **Visualization:** During the row (Station 5) or farmer's carry (Station 6), picture yourself completing your last wall ball rep. Build a mental image of crossing the finish line. This isn't woo-woo coaching; elite athletes consistently report using visualization to manage the final push.

# Elite Hyrox Athlete Training Methods: Comprehensive Knowledge Base

---

## Hunter McIntyre — "The Sheriff," "King of Hyrox"

**Bio snapshot:** 6'2", ~205 lb (93 kg). Three-time Hyrox World Champion. Six-time OCR World Champion. Murph world record holder (34:13). Former Broken Skull Challenge winner. CrossFit Games wildcard competitor (61st place, 2019). Hyrox world record of 53:22. Founder of HAOS Training (Hunter's Academy of Strength). Based between Malibu, CA and Boulder, CO.

---

### 1. Training Philosophy & Identity

Hunter McIntyre's core training philosophy is rooted in **consistency, progressive overload, and brutally high volume.** He has described himself as someone who treats competition "like war" with "tactics, strategy, mental warfare, physical warfare, guerrilla tactics" (*The Fastest Man in Fitness Podcast, EP.02*). His approach is unapologetically old-school and contrarian.

McIntyre's three foundational principles of training progression:
1. **Increase strength and position** — progressive overload with heavier loads.
2. **Increase speed and position** — faster reps at higher resistance.
3. **Increase endurance and position** — add more volume over time.

*(Source: BarBend interview, 2023)*

He writes his own programming and has done so for most of his career, though he has periodically hired coaches when his schedule becomes too busy: "I recently hired a coach because I'm so busy I don't want to think" (*Men's Health UK, 2022*). He also programs for his HAOS Training app, which serves athletes across all Hyrox tiers.

What makes McIntyre unique is his **hybrid lumberjack-athlete identity.** His foundation was literally built chopping trees during a substance-abuse rehab program after high school: "The necessity of the job turned me from a boy into a man, physically, mentally, and emotionally" (*Hook and Barrel*). He still incorporates wood chopping, stone lifting, and tire flipping into his training regimen.

He has stated: "Just get used to running an hour straight. It's an endurance event. I hold the world record, and I'm fucking running my ass off the whole time" (*Men's Health UK*). He believes Hyrox is "almost all legs" and recommends heavy squatting, wall balls, box step-ups, and lunges at least three days per week.

---

### 2. Weekly Training Structure

McIntyre describes a "great week" (when not traveling) as **six hours in the gym and 10–14 hours of cardio** (*Men's Health UK, 2022*). His HAOS HYROX PRO program prescribes:

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Training days/week** | 6 |
| **Sessions per day** | 1–2 |
| **Session duration** | 45–180 minutes |
| **Weekly time commitment** | 5–10 hours (program); up to 16–20 hours (his personal training) |
| **Cycle structure** | 3 weeks intensity build → 1 week recovery/deload |
| **Endurance sessions** | Can last up to 3 hours |

**Sample HAOS PRO Weekly Split:**

| Day | Focus |
|---|---|
| Monday | Heavy Strength + Short Conditioning (deadlift variations, pull-up progressions, 20-minute EMOM) |
| Tuesday | Running Focus + Accessories (interval running, sled work, core strengthening) |
| Wednesday | Full Body Power (Olympic lift variations, plyometric training, conditioning circuit) |
| Thursday | Hyrox Simulation (race-specific workout, transition practice, time trials) |
| Friday | Strength Endurance (high-rep strength work, muscular endurance, fatigue management) |
| Saturday | Long Conditioning (extended aerobic work, movement quality, recovery focus) |

*(Source: HAOS Training / hyroxtrainingplans.com)*

His personal training always includes **at least one upper body intensity day, one lower body intensity day, and one dedicated track day** every week (*BarBend interview*). He splits training between Boulder, CO (altitude training near the Flat Irons) and Malibu/Big Bear, CA.

---

### 3. Session Design Patterns

McIntyre favors **EMOMs, AMRAPs, and interval-based formats** for conditioning work. He combines these with traditional heavy lifting.

**Documented workout examples:**

**Hyrox Simulation Workout (filmed in NYC, 2025):**
- 18-minute EMOM: Sled push + TRX rows, alternating between 2-minute hard efforts with 1-minute rest or continuous flow.
- Then: 5 rounds of 20-calorie row + 20 burpees, aiming for each round to fit within ~1 minute of work.

*(Source: "HYROX Training with 3X World Champion Hunter McIntyre in NYC," YouTube, 2025)*

**Training Camp Workout (Episode 6, YouTube, 2024):**
- 20–25 minute AMRAP: 25 TRX rows → sled pull → 30 shoulder presses, with 10–15 minute active recovery on the bike between sets. Athletes choose shoulder press weight where they can hit 20 unbroken.

**The "Lumberjack Workout" (Hook and Barrel):**
- 10 minutes of wood chopping
- 5 minutes of heavy stump moving (pushing and pulling stumps)
- 5 rounds of max-effort tire slam intervals: 30 seconds work / 30 seconds rest
- 3–5 × 200-foot steep hill climbs carrying a 50–100 lb log

**The 20-Rep Squat Protocol:**
McIntyre sells an 8-week "20 Rep Squat Strength Guide" through HAOS Training, described as "formulated by Hunter McIntyre on his mission to win world titles." The protocol: pick a weight you think you'd be lucky to get 10 reps with, then don't stop until you've done 20 (*Men's Health UK*). This full-body plan is designed to "boost your strength and stamina through a 20-rep cycle."

**Cold Bar Technique for Grip Strength:**
McIntyre performs feats of athleticism and strength **without warming up** — a deliberately shocking stimulus. Examples include:
- "He-Man Challenge": 15 pull-ups cold with a 50 lb weight vest
- 17 pull-ups on a fingerboard (fingers in grip holes)
- 120-meter sandbag sprint in under 20 seconds

*(Source: BarBend interview)*

**Cycling Endurance:**
He rides "Magnus the Mountain Slayer," a single-speed bike, for 2+ hours. Because it's single-speed, if he stops pedaling he falls off, building what he calls "almost unstoppable physical and mental capacity" (*Men's Health UK*).

---

### 4. Hyrox-Specific Preparation

McIntyre approaches Hyrox station training through his HAOS PRO program which includes specific skill blocks for:
- **Sled push/pull mechanics** — drilled on Tuesday sessions with interval-based sled work
- **Burpee broad jump efficiency** — practiced for movement economy
- **Wall ball technique** — endurance protocols (e.g., 100 wall balls for time, then building 5-minute leg endurance sets to match)
- **Sandbag carry variations** — including the 120-meter sandbag sprint

His advice for station preparation is practical: "Test one of the workouts, like 100 wall balls for time: if it takes you five minutes, you should be doing something on your legs that's five minutes straight. It's not rocket science" (*Men's Health UK*).

Thursday in his HAOS PRO program is dedicated to **Hyrox Simulation** — race-specific workouts with transition practice and time trials. The program explicitly includes "race simulation" phases in weeks 5–8 of each training block.

---

### 5. Periodization & Peaking

McIntyre's periodization philosophy is blunt: "Just periodisation, man" (*Men's Health UK*). He alternates **endurance blocks with strength blocks**, fully focusing on each in turn rather than trying to train everything simultaneously.

**HAOS PRO Periodization:**

| Phase | Weeks | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1: Base Building | 1–4 | Aerobic capacity, strength foundation, movement quality, work capacity |
| Phase 2: Intensity Development | 5–8 | Lactate threshold, power development, skill refinement, race simulation |
| Phase 3: Peak Performance | 9–12 | Competition preparation, tapering protocols, mental preparation, performance optimization |

Within each phase, the micro-cycle follows a **3 weeks on / 1 week deload** pattern.

His diet is also periodized: "My diet is periodised, so I just got off a week of drinking as much as I could and eating ice cream" (post-season). As he gets further into competition season, "I start cutting out the rib-eye steak. You go towards the leaner cut of meat, or you go to fish and chicken" (*Men's Health UK, 2025*).

---

### 6. Recovery & Lifestyle

**Sleep:** McIntyre is notably unconventional here. He describes himself as "not much of a sleeper," routinely waking at 4 AM regardless of bedtime — whether he goes to bed at 8 PM or midnight (*BarBend interview*). This is an outlier among elite athletes.

**Nutrition:** McIntyre's diet is perhaps the most controversial aspect of his regimen:
- **Daily calorie intake:** 4,500–5,500 calories
- **Macros:** ~90g fat, 400–600g carbs, 180–250g protein
- **Staple foods:** Steak (2–3 per day), chicken, yogurt, maple syrup, honey, fruit, bread, pasta, oatmeal, sweet potatoes, Honey Nut Cheerios, ramen noodles, sticky buns
- **No vegetables.** He has stated: "You can't pay me to eat vegetables… Superheroes aren't made of vegetables, they're made of calories" (*Men's Health UK*). He claims this view was reinforced by sports nutritionist Dr. John Ivey.
- **300–500g of sugar per day:** "Sugar's the shit, I love that stuff" (*BarBend*)
- **Morning ritual:** Strong Coffee (with collagen), BLDR aminos, 3 tablespoons of honey

**Supplements:** He owns his own supplement company, **BLDR Sports**, and takes amino acids daily. He also takes collagen via his coffee brand.

**Post-season recovery:** He takes a deliberate period of debauchery: "I just got off a week of drinking as much as I could and eating ice cream" before ramping strength training back up (*Men's Health UK, 2025*).

---

### 7. Unique/Differentiating Methods

**The Alter Ego / "The Sheriff":** McIntyre uses an alter ego in competition — "The Sheriff." He explains: "You need an alter ego that comes out when necessary" (*Men's Health UK*). He self-talks by "relentlessly bad-mouthing himself, repeating only two or three words so he doesn't get distracted." This deliberate mental warfare extends to intimidating opponents: "I treat this like war. I have tactics, I have strategy, I have mental warfare, I have physical warfare, I'll use guerrilla tactics" (*HYROX podcast appearance, 2021*).

**The Cold Bar Technique:** Performing heavy strength feats without any warm-up — lifting 250 lb stones cold, weighted pull-ups cold — as a grip and neural preparedness tool. No other Hyrox athletes publicly train this way.

**The Lumberjack Workout:** No other elite Hyrox competitor integrates wood chopping, stump moving, and log carries as formal training modalities.

**Single-Speed Cycling:** The "Magnus the Mountain Slayer" bike forces continuous pedaling with no ability to coast, building mental toughness and sustained power output for hours at a time.

**Anti-Vegetable, Pro-Sugar Diet:** At 300–500g of sugar per day with zero vegetable intake, McIntyre's nutrition is arguably the most extreme departure from conventional sports nutrition in elite fitness.

**Pull-Up Contests with Naked Penalties:** He describes having athletes in his training group compete in pull-up contests where "the loser has to run around the neighborhood naked" — a psychological intensity tool (*BarBend interview*).

## Jake Dearden — Elite UK Hyrox Specialist

**Bio snapshot:** Age 26. Hyrox Men's Doubles World Champion (2024, with Marc Dean). Hyrox Master Trainer. Red Bull–sponsored athlete. Former ultramarathon runner (100 km at age 19, 7 marathons in 7 days, 10 marathons in 5 days). Age group world record holder (57:09). Recovered from two slipped discs. Currently pursuing solo Elite 15 World Championship qualification. Sub-2:30 marathon goal.

---

### 1. Training Philosophy & Identity

Jake Dearden's core philosophy can be distilled into one quote: **"Train as much as you can recover from."** He told *Men's Health*: "My job at the moment is to train and become the best at Hyrox. If you're looking at my training and thinking, 'I need to do that amount,' but you've got a full-time job, you've got family and you're only sleeping four hours a night because you've got little kids, it's just not going to work."

Dearden describes himself as "quite boring" with his training. He favors **repeating the same movements week in, week out** so he can track progress objectively. He's deeply analytical and has sought expertise outside of Hyrox — strength coaches, movement coaches, running coaches, physios, and elite ultrarunners like Tom Evans — because he believes "there are no Hyrox experts. You've got to look to other sports, where they've been doing it 40, 50 years" (*Men's Health UK, 2025*).

His approach to Hyrox has evolved significantly. Initially, he focused heavily on running because "there were a lot of professional runners or close-to-professional runners, triathletes and so on, who were coming into the sport and doing really well." After that block, he realized he'd "neglected the strength work," so he pivoted to balance both domains.

He views each Hyrox station **in combination with the subsequent run**: "I always look at the [workout station] and the run as one exercise, so if you're a strength athlete and you're amazing at the sled push, look at your sled push and your running time after as one exercise" (*Men's Health UK*).

---

### 2. Weekly Training Structure

Based on Jake Dearden's Myprotein feature ("Full Week of Training as a HYROX Athlete") and his various interviews, his typical weekly structure is:

| Day | AM Session | PM Session |
|---|---|---|
| **Monday** | 5K progression run | Strength workout |
| **Tuesday** | Strength workout | HYROX session (40–60 min engine-based workout incorporating Hyrox exercises) |
| **Wednesday** | Row intervals (e.g., 10 × 500m with 2 min rest) | — |
| **Thursday** | 10K progression run | Strength workout |
| **Friday** | Rest or active recovery (easy 15K exercise bike, Zone 2) | — |
| **Saturday** | Strength workout + team sweat session | — |
| **Sunday** | HYROX session: 50-minute AMRAP with running and exercises | — |

*(Source: Myprotein article)*

From his YouTube content with Built For Athletes, his training involves approximately **30–40 minutes of intense running** with warm-up and cool-down on either side in morning sessions, with evening sessions focused more on "erg work and practice but still at an intensity where I'm getting my heart rate up" (*"How A 26yr Old RedBull Athlete Is Dominating Fitness," YouTube, 2024*).

Key notes from Dearden himself:
- "Some of these sessions take no more than 30 minutes. I rarely, almost never, spend three hours in the gym in one day."
- He has a flexible schedule allowing AM/PM splits, which he acknowledges isn't possible for most people.
- He emphasizes that his plan is **specific to him** and shouldn't be seen as prescriptive for all athletes.

### 3. Session Design Patterns

Dearden uses a mix of **progression runs, interval work, strength sessions, and HYROX-specific AMRAPs.**

His HYROX sessions are 40–60 minute engine-based workouts incorporating Hyrox movements. On Sundays, he does 50-minute AMRAPs that combine running with functional movements.

His rowing intervals follow a classic structure: **10 × 500m with 2 minutes rest** — a bread-and-butter erg conditioning protocol.

He favors **threshold running** as a key training modality, with an emphasis on power-to-weight ratio. From the RMR Training Podcast appearance: his threshold training sessions are structured around sustained efforts at specific paces, with the goal of improving lactate threshold and VO2 max.

He uses **accumulation and intensification phases** within his strength training: "This intensification phase which often happens where the reps start to come down, you start to push it a little bit, because you've been on a leash during the accumulation phase" (*YouTube: "Training With 26yr Old RedBull Athlete Jake Dearden," 2025*).

---

### 4. Hyrox-Specific Preparation

Dearden prioritizes Hyrox stations **in order of race importance.** His hierarchy: "Starting off with your SkiErg – that's the most important exercise. If your heart rate skyrockets at the ski and you struggle, that's going to fatigue you for the rest of the race. But if you get fatigued at the burpees [the fourth station], you've had a good first half of the race" (*Men's Health UK*).

He integrates running with station work **only in the final 5–6 weeks** before a race. Before that, he separates running and strength: "I usually split up my running and my strength until about five to six weeks out from a race. Then I might swap out a couple of sessions so I'm doing some weights and then going straight into running, to practise running under fatigue. That prepares my body. But I think working on your running separately is going to be much more beneficial than trying to do everything fatigued all the time" (*Men's Health UK*).

---

### 5. Periodization & Peaking

Dearden follows a clear **block periodization model** with three phases, as outlined in his Built For Athletes article:

| Timeframe Before Race | Focus |
|---|---|
| **12+ weeks out** | Building a solid base of fitness (running & ergs), building overall strength, progressing all fitness elements |
| **12–6 weeks out** | Add Hyrox-specific exercises, progress to race-day weights, at least 1 Hyrox session per week, focus on muscular endurance and running speed |
| **6–1 weeks out** | Very specific Hyrox exercises and quantities mimicking race day, replicate race-day scenarios, practice technique/tactics, increase Hyrox sessions, trial race-day nutrition |
| **Race week** | Deload: reduced intensity and frequency, rest days approaching race day, ensure nutrition/sleep are optimal |

He learned from ultrarunner Tom Evans that "it was all about what you do in the month prior and how that affects your race" (*Men's Health UK*).

---

### 6. Recovery & Lifestyle

**Recovery as #1 Rule:** Dearden's biggest lesson came from injury — two slipped discs caused by neglecting recovery during his ultramarathon days. "Not prioritising recovery is probably the thing that I regret most" (*Men's Health UK*). He now states that **mobility training is "non-negotiable"** and has called it a "game-changer" in his return to competition (*Wellworthy*).

**Biometric Tracking:** He uses heart rate variability (HRV) and sleep quality data to dictate daily training load. "If the numbers are down, the intensity drops" (*Wellworthy*).

**Nutrition:** Dearden follows a high-protein approach:
- Protein target: **1.7–2.2g per kg of bodyweight per day**
- Prioritizes carbohydrates before training (bagels, porridge oats, rice, bananas)
- 80/20 rule: 80% whole foods, 20% flexible
- Includes healthy fats from animal fats and nuts
- Carb-loads the day before a race

**Supplements:** Caffeine (only before midday during training; unrestricted on race day), creatine daily, electrolytes ("non-negotiable"), and has been testing bicarbonate of soda gels as a lactate buffer.

**Post-race:** Always has a protein shake ready immediately after finishing for recovery advantage. Celebrates with a "nice meal" rather than drinking.

---

### 7. Unique/Differentiating Methods

**Station-Run Coupling Framework:** Dearden's perspective of treating each station + the following run as a single exercise unit is a distinctive analytical framework that informs both his training and race pacing.

**Expert Aggregation Model:** Rather than following a single Hyrox coach, he deliberately consults specialists from disparate sports (ultrarunning, strength and conditioning, movement science, physiotherapy) and synthesizes their advice for Hyrox application. He's stated: "Hyrox hasn't been around for very long. Even though there are Hyrox coaches out there, there are no Hyrox experts" (*Men's Health UK*).

**Late-Stage Integration:** His unique periodization approach of keeping running and strength completely separate until the final 5–6 weeks before a race, then introducing combined "run under fatigue" sessions, contrasts with many Hyrox coaches who advocate mixed-modal training year-round.

**Mental Performance:** Dearden has worked on managing race-day nerves that previously consumed him for two weeks pre-race. After speaking with a sports psychologist, he adopted the principle: "The race is going to happen no matter what, so there's no point thinking about it two weeks beforehand" (*Men's Health UK*). He now focuses on enjoying the lead-up and only "switching on" on race day.

## Dan Churchill — Chef, Hybrid Athlete, Hyrox Content Creator

**Bio snapshot:** Australian-born, NYC-based professional chef and hybrid athlete. Master's degree in Exercise Science. Former strength and conditioning coach for rugby and AFL athletes. Executive chef at The Osprey (1 Hotel Brooklyn). Author of *Eat Like a Legend*. Partner with Centr (Chris Hemsworth's fitness app). Leadville 100 finisher. Currently chasing a sub-60 Hyrox finish. YouTube series documenting his Hyrox journey (@danchurchillcooks).

---

### 1. Training Philosophy & Identity

Dan Churchill represents a uniquely **nutrition-first, multisport hybrid** approach to Hyrox. His background bridges exercise science and professional cooking, giving him a perspective that most Hyrox athletes lack.

His core philosophy: "I grew up playing rugby, and our training was intense—weights, sprints, long efforts, skills. I loved it. Honestly, I loved the training even more than the game. It gave me a solid foundation in programming, which became part of my role as a strength and conditioning coach. I took that philosophy and applied it to the way I now train for Hyrox. It's the same methodology, just refined" (*The Hybrid Letter, 2025*).

Churchill is transparent about **not being a natural speedster:** "I've never seen myself as an elite athlete. I wasn't born with top-end speed, but I've got a great engine—my heart rate and recovery are excellent. Speed, though? Not my strength" (*The Hybrid Letter*). This honesty is central to his content — he documents both "the highs and lows of his journey" (*RXR Sports bio*).

His training philosophy prioritizes three pillars in order: **Sleep, nutrition, and hydration — "those are my big three"** (*The Hybrid Letter*).

---

### 2. Weekly Training Structure

Churchill trains **4–12 sessions per week** depending on the phase, balancing his training with his career as a chef and content creator. His YouTube series provides windows into his actual training days.

Based on his content and interviews, his typical structure during a Hyrox block includes:
- **AM track workouts** (speed sessions, interval running)
- **Midday weight training sessions**
- **HYROX-specific simulation efforts** focused on maintaining Zone 4 heart rate

From his YouTube series (Episode 8, Italy/NYC, 2025): he describes "incorporating simulation efforts to stay in Zone 4, geared towards Hyrox prep" and "crushing a workout session with the team at Meatpacking Athletic."

Churchill's **7-week training block** for the Chicago Hyrox 2024 was documented in Episode 5 of his YouTube series, where he was chasing a sub-60 Hyrox finish. His entry time started at 1:11, improved to 1:08, and his target for Chicago was between 1:07–1:08.

---

### 3. Session Design Patterns

Churchill uses **performance testing as a training design tool.** In Episode 10 of his YouTube series (February 2025), he underwent: blood work to understand his internal state, a heart rate zone test, and a VO2 max assessment. "The day starts with a speed session, followed by a blood test, weight training, a heart rate & VO2 Max test."

He structures workouts around **heart rate zones**, particularly:
- **Zone 2** for aerobic base building
- **Zone 4** for Hyrox-specific simulation work (threshold intensity)

His approach differs from pure Hyrox athletes because he also trains for other endurance events (Leadville 100, Sydney Marathon), requiring periodization across modalities.

---

### 4. Hyrox-Specific Preparation

Churchill's biggest Hyrox lesson was underestimating the running: "I underestimated the running. It's 70% of the event, and I didn't fully factor in how much it would affect fatigue. Going from a run into burpee broad jumps is a different beast. Even though I'm solid at burpees, that transition was brutal" (*The Hybrid Letter*).

He focuses on **learning to "ride out Zone 4 and get back into rhythm"** — the ability to sustain threshold-level effort through station transitions and back into running.

His content with Hunter McIntyre (YouTube Episode 2: "Day In The Life Of A Professional Chef and Hybrid Athlete | Hyrox Training W/ McIntyre") shows him training directly alongside McIntyre, absorbing elite-level Hyrox session design.

---

### 5. Periodization & Peaking

Churchill structures his Hyrox prep in training blocks. His Chicago 2024 prep was a focused **7-week training block**. For his World Championships qualification (YouTube Episode 1, November 2025), he documented the beginning of a new dedicated prep block.

He has stated that "Leadville last year taught me the value of preparation. It's about putting in the reps and improving 1% every day" (*The Hybrid Letter*). His long-term trajectory shows a deliberate, multi-year build toward his sub-60 goal rather than a single peak cycle.

---

### 6. Recovery & Lifestyle

**Nutrition — Churchill's Superpower:** As a professional chef with a Master's in Exercise Science, his nutrition approach is arguably the most sophisticated of any Hyrox athlete:
- He focuses on **meal timing** — the right macros at the right time relative to training
- Has increased caloric intake after realizing "I used to just eat a banana before training—maybe 30 grams of carbs—but I didn't account for how much I was burning, even in Zone 2" (*The Hybrid Letter*)
- Added **fish oil regularly** for omega-3s
- Uses **Complex G1 from BPN** for additional carbs
- Increased **Vitamin D3** (through AG1)
- Reduces dietary fat around workouts for quicker energy access
- Avoids dense protein and high-fat meals within 2 hours of sleep

**Sleep:** Churchill uses a **Whoop strap** and has noted that three months of poor sleep visibly impacted his hormones, Zone 2 heart rate, and recovery. He emphasizes the importance of **REM and deep sleep** specifically, not just time in bed. He recommends finishing eating at least 2 hours before sleep and avoiding insulin-spiking carbs before bed.

**Hydration:** Listed as one of his "big three" alongside sleep and nutrition.

**Supplement Protocol:**
- AG1 (for Vitamin D3 and micronutrients)
- Fish oil (omega-3)
- Complex G1 from BPN (carbohydrate supplement)
- Whoop strap for biometric recovery tracking

---

### 7. Unique/Differentiating Methods

**Chef-Athlete Dual Identity:** Churchill is the only elite-level Hyrox content creator who is simultaneously a professional chef. His recipe-creation for athletes — bridging the gap between nutritionist recommendations and practical cooking — is genuinely unique. He created athlete-friendly recipes for rugby players early in his career and applies the same approach to hybrid athletes.

**Micronutrient Focus:** He refers to micronutrients as "the fifth macronutrient" — an unusual level of attention to vitamins and minerals among Hyrox athletes who typically focus only on protein, carbs, and fats.

**Science-Backed Content:** His Master's in Exercise Science gives his training and nutrition advice a research foundation that most Hyrox athlete-influencers lack. He writes the *Legendary* newsletter sharing "science-backed, actionable insights on nutrition, performance, and recovery."

**Multi-Endurance Background:** Having completed the Leadville 100 ultramarathon, a Sydney Marathon, and pursuing sub-60 Hyrox simultaneously, Churchill brings a cross-endurance perspective. His aerobic engine is built from ultra-distance work, which he applies to Hyrox's shorter but more intense demands.

**Transparency in the Process:** Churchill documents his blood work, VO2 max testing, and performance metrics publicly. This data-driven transparency — including sharing actual numbers and setbacks — is more granular than what most Hyrox athletes reveal.

## Jason Khalipa — CrossFit Games Champion Crossing Into Hyrox

**Bio snapshot:** 2008 CrossFit Games Individual Champion. 3× Team USA CrossFit member. Founder and CEO of NCFIT gyms and TRAIN HARD online training. Author of *As Many Reps As Possible*. Host of the Jason Khalipa Podcast (formerly "Effort Over Everything"). Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu brown belt. Pediatric cancer advocate. Competed in HYROX Dallas Pro Doubles (2024) with partner Gabe Yanez.

---

### 1. Training Philosophy & Identity

Jason Khalipa's training philosophy is defined by what he calls the **AMRAP Mentality** — extended beyond the gym into a life philosophy. In his book *As Many Reps As Possible*, he outlines five core principles:

1. **Know your WHY** — use your purpose to fuel your effort
2. **Focus on what you can control**
3. **Work hard**
4. **Switch gears** — be fully present in each task
5. **Re-evaluate** — adjust priorities as life changes

*(Source: Goodreads / Mark Bell's PowerCast #200)*

He's described the AMRAP mentality as: "Taking as many 'reps' as possible of the task in front of you, giving it your best, and then moving on to the next task, and repeat" (*Mark Bell's PowerCast*).

Khalipa's approach to fitness is **pragmatic and time-efficient.** Having transitioned from elite-level CrossFit competition to running businesses, raising a family, and training BJJ, he now prioritizes "protectors and providers" — people with limited training hours who need maximum fitness return on investment. His TRAIN HARD platform is built around this ethos.

His first experience with Hyrox was documented in a three-part YouTube series ("Training for HYROX," November–December 2024) where he and Gabe Yanez competed in the Pro Doubles division at HYROX Dallas. The first episode was titled "CrossFit Games Champion **Humbled** By HYROX" — indicating the learning curve even for a CrossFit legend.

---

### 2. Weekly Training Structure

Khalipa's current weekly structure (outside of specific Hyrox prep) includes:

| Time Slot | Activity |
|---|---|
| Early AM | Cardio and/or ruck walks |
| Midday | NCFIT workout (NCX track — includes strength + WOD) |
| Various (3×/week) | Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu |
| Active recovery | Long walks (daily minimum) |

*(Source: T-Nation AMA, 2024)*

He describes his approach: "I train BJJ 3× a week and do our NCFIT workouts daily. I also typically do early AM cardio and/or ruck walks to start the day. If I feel super fatigued, I'll try and reduce the volume. However, doing nothing isn't something I really ever do. I'll at a minimum go for a long walk" (*T-Nation AMA*).

**During his professional CrossFit career,** his daily structure was more intensive and divided into three distinct blocks:
- **AM:** Cardio
- **Midday:** CrossFit (couplets, triplets, and for-time workouts)
- **Evening:** Stamina building on gymnastic movements (e.g., 10-minute EMOM of 10 strict pull-ups)

*(Source: T-Nation AMA)*

For Hyrox-specific preparation, he worked with legendary endurance coach **Chris

(Source: BTWB Programs page, Rogue Fitness product page)

### Progression Model

PRVN programs in named **cycles** (e.g., "Artemis Cycle," "Poseidon Cycle") with clear periodization:

- **Powerlifting:** 5-3-1 style progression focused on maintaining strength in critical rep ranges (Back Squat, Strict Press, Deadlift toward 1RM testing)
- **Weightlifting:** Alternating weekly focus — complexes for technique building and familiarity with ~3RM/ladder work, progressing from hang positional work to power variations to full lifts
- **Gymnastics:** Strict strength development → high skill integration → Murph prep
- **Conditioning:** Balanced across time domains — one workout/week targeting 7–11 min, one at 11–15 min, one at 20+ min, plus intervals and EMOMs for capacity
- **Transition phases** align with the CrossFit Open (3-week transition), front-loading strength and back-loading Open workout intensity
- **HYROX track** uses structured **8-week cycles** year-round

### Hyrox Applicability Analysis

**What Transfers Well:**
- **PRVN HYROX track** is purpose-built — 8-week cycles, daily programming, race-day priming protocols, and leveled scaling make this a direct fit
- The **Affiliate program's conditioning structure** (balanced time domains from 7–11 min through 20+ min) mirrors the varied demands of Hyrox (roughly 60–90 min race with alternating running and functional stations)
- **EMOM and interval formatting** (e.g., "Bowser") closely replicates the work:rest pacing demands of transitioning between Hyrox running segments and stations
- **Sled work** is explicitly programmed (Crossover Sled Drags in accessories), which is one of the most Hyrox-specific movements
- **Farmer carries** are regularly included in accessory work
- **Multi-level scaling** (Levels 1/2/3) allows an AI coach to auto-scale based on athlete profile
- **Cyclical endurance sessions** (Thursday aerobic focus with running + rowing) build the aerobic base Hyrox demands

**What's Missing or Needs Modification:**
- The **Affiliate track prioritizes CrossFit competition movements** (Ring Muscle-Ups, Chest-to-Bar Pull-Ups, Snatches) that have zero Hyrox transfer
- **Running volume is insufficient** for Hyrox prep — Thursday is the primary running day, but Hyrox athletes need 3–4 dedicated running sessions per week
- **Olympic lifting frequency** is higher than necessary for Hyrox; that time would be better spent on rowing/ski erg/bike intervals and running progressions
- **Wall balls** are programmed but not at Hyrox-specific standards (100 reps at specific target height)
- **Burpee broad jumps** are absent from most sample programming
- **SkiErg** is available but not emphasized in the way Hyrox demands

**Modification for 16-Week Hyrox Prep:**
1. Replace Olympic lifting days with Hyrox-specific station practice (wall balls ×100, sled push/pull, rowing 1km, burpee broad jumps ×80m)
2. Add 2–3 weekly running sessions at varied intensities (Zone 2 base, tempo, race-pace intervals)
3. Retain the EMOM/interval conditioning format but swap CrossFit movements for Hyrox station movements
4. Keep the 5-3-1 strength progression but focus on squat, deadlift, and lunges (eliminate strict press emphasis)
5. Use the PRVN HYROX track directly if available, supplementing with additional running volume

### Key Programming Principles for AI Coach Extraction

1. **Themed daily structure** with clear intent (strength day, aerobic day, sprint day) — the AI should assign a daily purpose
2. **Multi-level scaling** (Level 1/2/3) based on athlete capability — the AI should auto-prescribe the appropriate level
3. **Percentage-based strength work** building through 5-3-1 progressions to 1RM testing
4. **Named training cycles** with transition phases — the AI should plan in 6–8 week mesocycles
5. **60-minute session architecture** with time blocks — the AI should structure every session with warm-up, primer, main work, conditioning, and mobility
6. **Balanced time-domain exposure** across the week (short sprint, medium grind, long endurance)
7. **Integrated mobility** within the session, not optional afterthought

(Sources: hwpotraining.com, Rogue Fitness, garagegymrevisited.com, mensfitnesstoday.com)

### Core Philosophy

Fraser's programming philosophy centers on several principles derived from his competitive career:

1. **Percentage-based progression:** All strength training is based on 1RM percentages, with RPE tools available for athletes who haven't yet tested maxes. This ensures individualization at scale.
2. **Phase-based structure aligned to the CrossFit season:** Flagship 2.0 follows "thoughtfully designed PHASES that progress strength and work capacity, tailored to the CROSSFIT SEASON" culminating with the Open and Quarterfinals.
3. **Community synchronization:** Unlike the original Flagship (where everyone started on Day 1 regardless of join date), Flagship 2.0 has all athletes on the same training day for "better coaching support, real-time leaderboards, and sharing your fitness journey."
4. **Deload intelligence:** The program uses 4-week blocks with 3 weeks on and 1 deload week. Two 4-week blocks form an 8-week cycle, and the macro structure operates in 16-week super-cycles (16-16-16).
5. **Intensity through forced breaks:** Rather than long unbroken AMRAPs, Fraser programs short work windows with built-in rest (e.g., 4 × 2-min AMRAPs with 1-min rest) to force higher intensity output per window.

- **Accessories always present;** bonus work (often Zone 2 cardio) is optional

### Session Structure: HWPO Flagship vs. Flagship 60 vs. PRO

**Flagship Session Architecture:**
1. Coaching video from Mat Fraser or staff coach (intent briefing)
2. Intentional warm-up (mimicking session movements)
3. Strength progressions with strength accessory work
4. Gymnastics progressions
5. Metcon OR monostructural conditioning (rowing, running, swimming)
6. Accessories
7. Optional bonus/extra workout (can add ~1 hour)

**Flagship 60** removes either a strength piece or accessory piece(s) from Flagship; occasionally shortens the metcon by 25–33% or lightens strength percentages slightly. Never exceeds 70 minutes including warm-up and clean-up.

**HWPO PRO** requires:
- 2 sessions/day, 3–4 hours total
- Top 300 Quarterfinal placement
- Specific strength minimums (245/155 lb Snatch, 275/185 lb C&J, 365 lb Back Squat)
- No modifications or scaling
- Access to track, pool, specialty equipment
- Off-Season and Comp Prep phases with track variations (Aerobic Focus track for athletes who struggle with longer metcons)

**HWPO Strong 2.0:**
- Each session: warm-up → primary lift → secondary lift → accessory work → optional metcon/conditioning
- 60–75 minutes per session
- 4–8 week blocks with deload every 4th week
- Hybrid percentage + RPE progression

- 40:00 EMOM alternating stations:
  - Min 1: Row Calories
  - Min 2: Wall Balls
  - Min 3: KB Swings
  - Min 4: Box Jumps
  - (Repeat 10 rounds)
- Built-in intensity elements in 1–2 stations to prevent "cruise control"

**Workout 4: HWPO Sweat — Full Body (Published Sample)**
- 0:00–12:00 — EMOM 12:
  - 1a. Glute Bridge × 30s
  - 1b. Side Plank Hip Touch × 20s each side

- Secondary Lift: e.g., Romanian Deadlift 3 × 8
- Accessory Work: 3–4 exercises (single-leg, core, posterior chain)
- Optional Metcon: 8–12 min conditioning piece
- *Deload week every 4th week*

### Hyrox Applicability Analysis

**What Transfers Well:**
- **Rowing dominance:** HWPO programs extensive rowing volume, which directly transfers to the 1km row station in Hyrox
- **Assault/Echo Bike work** is standard — transfers to the bike erg conditioning demands
- **Zone 2 bonus work** (40-min spin bike/run @145 BPM) is exactly the aerobic base work Hyrox athletes need
- **Sandbag cleans** appear in metcons — a direct Hyrox station movement
- **Wall balls** feature in conditioning pieces
- **Forced-break interval structure** (short AMRAPs with built-in rest) trains the ability to sustain high output across transitions, exactly like moving between Hyrox running and station segments
- **4-week block periodization with deloads** is directly applicable to a 16-week Hyrox prep (4 mesocycles)
- **Percentage-based strength work** keeps loading individualized and progressive
- **Strong 2.0's structure** (primary lift + secondary lift + optional metcon in 60–75 min) is an excellent template for Hyrox strength days

**What's Missing:**
- **Running volume is grossly insufficient** for Hyrox — running appears occasionally in metcons and as bonus Zone 2, but a Hyrox athlete needs 8km of total race running and should be running 20–30+ km/week in training
- **Olympic lifting takes up significant training time** with no Hyrox transfer (no snatches, cleans, or jerks in Hyrox)
- **Gymnastic skills** (muscle-ups, handstand walks, etc.) consume programming space with zero Hyrox applicability
- **Session length of ~2 hours** is problematic for time-constrained athletes; the Flagship 60 variant helps but still sacrifices running opportunities
- **Sled push/pull** — despite being the hardest Hyrox station for many athletes — appears to be underrepresented relative to its race importance
- **Burpee broad jumps** are not standard in HWPO programming
- **Ski erg** is programmed but not at Hyrox-specific distances/intensities (1km race segment)
- **Lunges** (particularly weighted walking lunges, a Hyrox station) don't appear with the specificity or volume Hyrox demands

**Modification for 16-Week Hyrox Prep:**
1. Use the **4-week block + deload structure** (4 mesocycles of 3+1)
2. Replace all Olympic lifting with Hyrox station practice and additional running
3. Keep the **squat, deadlift, and bench** strength progressions (excellent base for sled, lunge, and wall ball performance)
4. Expand running from bonus work to **3–4 dedicated sessions/week** at varying intensities
5. Adopt the **forced-break interval metcon format** but populate it with Hyrox movements
6. Use the **Flagship 60 or Strong 2.0 template** as the base structure to keep sessions manageable

### Key Programming Principles for AI Coach Extraction

1. **Phased periodization in 4-week blocks** with programmed deload weeks — the AI must auto-schedule deloads
2. **1RM percentage-based loading** with RPE fallback for untested athletes
3. **Coaching video/intent briefing model** — the AI should provide intent and stimulus descriptions for every session
4. **Forced-break interval design** to maximize intensity within work windows
5. **Community synchronization** (everyone on the same day) improves accountability — the AI should support cohort-based training
6. **Distinct tracks for different time budgets** (2-hour vs 60-min) — the AI needs a session-length selector that trims intelligently (remove accessories, shorten metcon, lighten percentages)
7. **Progressive onboarding** — new athletes start with introductory weeks before full-intensity programming
8. **Heavy emphasis on monostructural conditioning** (dedicated rowing, biking, running pieces separate from metcons)

## 3. CompTrain (Ben Bergeron)

### Program Overview

CompTrain is Ben Bergeron's programming platform, born from his 15 years coaching elite CrossFit Games athletes and his broader philosophy around gym programming as a retention and community-building tool. CompTrain positions itself explicitly as **gym programming** — designed for affiliate class settings rather than individual competitors.

**Program tiers:**

| Track | Format | Target Audience | Description |
|-------|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| **CompTrain Gym Programming** | 6 days/week class plans | Affiliate owners & coaches | Complete daily lesson plans with coaching notes, scaling, and class management |
| **Benchmark testing** | Every 2 weeks | All members | 24 repeated workouts/year for progress tracking |

CompTrain is available through the **Wodify Marketplace** and its own platform (comptrain.com). The programming is delivered as turnkey class plans that coaches can implement immediately.

**Key positioning difference:** While PRVN and HWPO are athlete-facing (individuals subscribe), CompTrain is primarily **gym-facing** (affiliate owners subscribe, members follow in class). Bergeron emphasizes that "programming is a retention tool" and that a dedicated employee handles programming creation while he reviews everything. (Source: YouTube interview)

### "Intentional Intensity" Philosophy

CompTrain's programming philosophy rests on several explicitly stated principles:

1. **Program for the majority, not the top 10%:** "Programming for the top 10% of your athletes and scaling for the rest doesn't work." The goal is workouts that are "doable but difficult for most" where the class does the same work together.

2. **Consistent weekly structure with variance in workouts:** A "predictable rhythm to the schedule" that members can build routines around, while the specific movements and loadings change.

3. **Concurrent development:** "Rather than focusing on building strength one month, endurance in another, and high-intensity capacity in the next, we build them together every week and all year round." This is a fundamentally different periodization approach from PRVN and HWPO's blocked phases.

4. **Intentional intensity:** "Intensity drives results, but when structured poorly and without intelligent controls around volume, it can become the barrier to progress." CompTrain implements this through "movement pairings, loading, & rep schemes that fall into our programming sweet spot for sustainable power output."

5. **No complex gymnastics:** "We don't program complex gymnastic movements... The reality of your member's lives demands strength, endurance, and capacity. It doesn't require them to know how to walk on their hands."

6. **Running as a cornerstone:** Programming includes "running 2-3 times a week at varying intensities and distances" — significantly more running emphasis than most CrossFit programming platforms.

7. **Benchmark testing every 2 weeks:** 24 workouts repeated annually for progress tracking — "progress is not just hoped for but expected and achieved."

### Weekly Template

CompTrain publishes its weekly structure explicitly:

| Day | Strength Component | Conditioning Component | Duration |
|-----|--------------------|----------------------|----------|
| **Monday** | Press (Bench or Shoulder Press) | 8–18 min Conditioning | ~60 min |
| **Tuesday** | — | 20–35 min Conditioning | ~60 min |
| **Wednesday** | Pull (Deadlift / Sumo Deadlift) | 8–18 min Conditioning | ~60 min |
| **Thursday** | — | 20–35 min Conditioning | ~60 min |
| **Friday** | Squat (Front or Back Squat) | 8–18 min Conditioning | ~60 min |
| **Saturday** | — | 20–35 min Team Workouts | ~60 min |
| **Sunday** | — | Run 2–3 miles | ~30 min |

(Source: comptrain.com/gym-programming-principles)

**Key structural patterns:**
- **3 strength days** (Mon/Wed/Fri) each paired with a shorter conditioning piece (8–18 min)
- **3 conditioning-only days** (Tue/Thu/Sat) with longer workouts (20–35 min)
- **Saturday is team day** — community-building format
- **Sunday is a dedicated run** — 2–3 miles, reinforcing running as a cornerstone
- Strength follows a **Press → Pull → Squat** rotation across the week
- **Benchmark workouts every 2 weeks** replace the scheduled conditioning piece

### Session Structure

Based on the published programming template ("Hole in the Wall"), a typical CompTrain session follows:

| Phase | Example | Duration |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Whiteboard Brief | Coach explains intent, scaling, target times | 3–5 min |
| Movement instruction | Tell, Show, Do, Check format | 5–8 min |
| Strength piece | 3 × 8 Back Squats on 3:00 clock | 12–15 min |
| Transition/Practice round | Movement rehearsal | 3–5 min |
| Conditioning piece | Every 2:00 × 5 Rounds of wallballs + DB snatches | 10–18 min |
| Post-workout cool down | Accessory/mobility/chat | 8–10 min |

**Coaching integration:** CompTrain provides detailed "Look For" coaching cues (e.g., "Flat feet — look for athletes gripping the ground with the foot throughout the rep") and specific time management guidance for class flow.

### Strength Programming Approach

CompTrain's strength work follows a notable pattern visible across months of published programming:

**Press variations (Monday):**
- Bench Press: Max Reps @80%, @90%, Heavy Set of 20, or climbing sets
- Strict Press: Max Reps, sets within 12:00 windows, 3:00 × 3 sets

**Pull variations (Wednesday):**
- Deadlift: Max Reps, 12:00 windows, climbing sets
- Sumo Deadlift: Alternates with conventional, 5-second negatives, 5–7 climbing sets

**Squat variations (Friday):**
- Back Squat: Build to Heavy Single, Max Reps @85–90%, add 10# from last attempt
- Front Squat: Max Reps @80–90%, 12:00 windows

The **"Add 10# From Last Attempt"** notation (visible in the May 10 Back Squat entry referencing 2/26/24) reveals CompTrain's long-term progressive overload tracking — the same test is repeated months later with explicit load increases.

### Representative Sample Workouts

**Workout 1: Strength + Conditioning Monday — "Hole in the Wall"**
- *Strength:* On the 3:00 × 3 Sets: 8 Back Squats — Start at 60% and build

### Hyrox Applicability Analysis

**Strengths — What Transfers Exceptionally Well:**

1. **Running is a cornerstone.** CompTrain is the *only* program of the three that explicitly programs running 2–3×/week plus a dedicated Sunday run of 2–3 miles. This is the single most important element for Hyrox transfer. The "Run Up" workout alone includes 4km of running with bodyweight movements between — nearly identical to Hyrox's alternating run/station format.

2. **Concurrent development model** matches Hyrox demands. Hyrox athletes need strength, endurance, and capacity simultaneously — CompTrain builds all three every week, all year. This avoids the "peaked for strength but untrained aerobically" trap.

3. **Sustainable intensity philosophy** ("build up, not burn out") aligns perfectly with Hyrox training, which requires high training volume without overtraining.

4. **No complex gymnastics** removes wasted training time. CompTrain already self-selects away from muscle-ups, handstand walks, and other CrossFit-specific skills with zero Hyrox transfer.

5. **20–35 minute conditioning pieces** (Tue/Thu/Sat) are in the right duration range for simulating portions of a Hyrox race.

6. **Team workout Saturdays** build pacing awareness and competitive energy — useful for Hyrox Doubles and race-day intensity.

7. **Benchmark testing every 2 weeks** provides the regular performance data an AI coach needs to adjust training loads.

8. **Deadlift, squat, and press strength progressions** build the base needed for sled push/pull, lunges, and wall balls.

9. **Wall balls are frequently programmed** (e.g., 25 reps in "Hole in the Wall," "Nancy" features overhead squats which share movement patterns).

10. **Rowing and Bike Erg** are standard conditioning tools (e.g., "Total Whine" with alternating row/bike intervals).

**Weaknesses — What's Missing:**

1. **Sled push/pull** is not a standard CompTrain movement — this is the single biggest gap given it's the most challenging Hyrox station for most athletes.

2. **Burpee broad jumps** are absent (CompTrain programs burpees, but not the broad jump variation specific to Hyrox).

3. **Ski erg** appears occasionally but is not programmed at race-specific distances (1km).

4. **Weighted walking lunges** at Hyrox-specific loads and distances are not a standard feature.

5. **Farmer carries** are not regularly programmed in the main class (may appear in accessories).

6. **Running is 2–3×/week, but Hyrox athletes likely need 4–5×/week** at 20–30+ km total weekly volume. The Sunday 2–3 mile run is a good start but insufficient.

7. **Power cleans and overhead squats** consume training time with limited Hyrox transfer beyond general fitness.

8. **Time-domain distribution** may skew shorter than ideal — many conditioning pieces are 8–18 min, but Hyrox race duration is 60–90+ min. More 30–45 min pieces would help.

**Modification for 16-Week Hyrox Prep:**
1. **Keep the Monday/Wednesday/Friday strength + conditioning structure** — it's excellent
2. **Replace Tuesday/Thursday conditioning with Hyrox-specific sessions:** e.g., "Hyrox simulation" workouts with 1km run + station, repeated 4× with different stations
3. **Increase Sunday run to 5–8km** and add a second dedicated run on Tuesday or Thursday
4. **Add sled work 2×/week** (push and pull at Hyrox race loads)
5. **Program Hyrox station practice as the conditioning pieces:** wall balls ×100, burpee broad jumps ×80m, farmer carry ×200m, lunges ×200m
6. **Use benchmark workouts as Hyrox-specific tests:** e.g., timed 1km row, timed 200m sled push, timed 100 wall balls
7. **Retain the concurrent development philosophy** — never drop strength entirely, but shift from max-strength testing to strength-endurance (higher reps, moderate load)

### Key Programming Principles for AI Coach Extraction

1. **Concurrent development:** Build strength, endurance, and capacity every week — never enter a "strength-only" or "endurance-only" phase
2. **Running as a non-negotiable cornerstone** at 2–3×/week minimum — the AI must include running in every weekly plan
3. **Predictable weekly structure with movement variance** — athletes should know "Monday is strength + conditioning" but the specific movements change
4. **"Intentional intensity" controls:** Movement pairings, loading, and rep schemes that create sustainable power output — the AI should calculate and cap total session volume/intensity
5. **Benchmark testing cadence:** Repeat standardized tests every 2 weeks to track progress — the AI needs a testing protocol library
6. **Program for the median athlete, not the top 10%** — the AI should default to accessible movements and scale up, not the reverse
7. **Team/partner formats** weekly for community and pacing practice
8. **Class-duration constraint** (~60 min) forces efficient session design — the AI should respect time budgets
9. **"Add weight from last attempt" progressive overload tracking** — the AI must store and reference historical performance data
10. **Detailed coaching cues per movement** ("Look For" format) — the AI should provide real-time technique reminders

## Cross-Program Comparative Summary

| Dimension | PRVN | HWPO | CompTrain |
|-----------|------|------|-----------|
| **Primary audience** | Affiliate classes + Hyrox athletes | Individual CrossFit athletes | Affiliate class programming |
| **Session length** | 60 min (affiliate) | ~2 hrs (Flagship) / 60 min (60) | ~60 min |
| **Weekly frequency** | 6–7 days | 5+1 active recovery + 1 rest | 6 days + Sunday run |
| **Periodization** | Named cycles, 8-week blocks | 4-week blocks, 16-week macro | Concurrent year-round |
| **Strength model** | 5-3-1 progressions | Percentage-based, high volume | Max reps at %, climbing sets |
| **Running emphasis** | Moderate (1×/week primary) | Low (bonus Zone 2) | High (2–3×/week + Sunday run) |
| **Olympic lifting** | High frequency | High frequency | Moderate (power variations) |
| **Complex gymnastics** | Yes (Ring MU, HSPU) | Yes (extensive) | No (deliberately excluded) |
| **Scaling approach** | 3 levels per WOD | Percentages + RPE | Scaling for accessibility |
| **Hyrox direct applicability** | Medium-High (has dedicated HYROX track) | Medium-Low (needs heavy modification) | Medium-High (running + conditioning focus) |
| **Best Hyrox transfer elements** | Sled work, EMOMs, HYROX track | Rowing, Zone 2, block periodization | Running volume, concurrent development, sustainability |
| **Biggest Hyrox gaps** | Running volume (affiliate track) | Running, no sled/lunge specificity | No sled work, insufficient race-length sessions |

### Synthesis: Optimal AI Coach Design Principles

Drawing from all three programs, an AI coaching system for Hyrox preparation should:

1. **Use HWPO's 4-week block periodization with deloads** (3 on / 1 deload) within a 16-week macro
2. **Adopt CompTrain's concurrent development philosophy** — never sacrifice running or endurance for a "strength phase"
3. **Follow PRVN's 60-minute session architecture** with time-blocked phases (warm-up → primer → main work → conditioning → mobility)
4. **Program running 3–4×/week minimum** (borrowing CompTrain's cornerstone principle and expanding it)
5. **Use HWPO's percentage-based loading with RPE fallback** for all strength work
6. **Implement PRVN's multi-level scaling** (3 tiers per workout) to serve athletes from beginner to advanced
7. **Design conditioning pieces in HWPO's forced-break interval format** but populate them with Hyrox-specific movements
8. **Test benchmarks every 2 weeks** (CompTrain model) using Hyrox-specific standards (1km row time, 200m sled push time, 100 wall balls time, 8km run time)
9. **Provide intent briefings** for every session (HWPO coaching video model translated to text/AI guidance)
10. **Exclude non-transferable movements** (Olympic lifts, complex gymnastics, handstand walks) in favor of Hyrox station work — following CompTrain's pragmatic movement selection philosophy

This synthesized approach captures the periodization intelligence of HWPO, the session structure and scalability of PRVN, and the sustainable conditioning philosophy and running emphasis of CompTrain — creating a purpose-built Hyrox preparation system.

# Commercial Training Program Analysis for Hyrox Race Preparation

*An in-depth evaluation of three training ecosystems for applicability to Hyrox-specific AI coaching*

## 1. Persist by Functional Bodybuilding (Marcus Filly)

### Program Overview & Creator Background

Marcus Filly is a six-time CrossFit Games athlete and longtime CrossFit affiliate owner who pivoted his training philosophy after experiencing severe burnout and physical breakdown following the 2016 CrossFit Games. That inflection point catalyzed the creation of **Functional Bodybuilding (FBB)**, an approach that blends traditional bodybuilding hypertrophy methods with functional movement patterns, controlled tempos, and an explicit emphasis on recovery and longevity.

The flagship program, **Persist**, is a subscription-based, self-guided training platform delivered through a web-based app (Atom Training). It is not available as a native mobile app but can be bookmarked and accessed through a browser. Persist is designed for intermediate to advanced lifters—Filly and reviewers consistently note it is **not suited for true beginners** due to training volume and exercise complexity.

**Pricing:**

| Billing Cycle | Cost |
|---|---|
| Monthly | $39/month (includes 2-week free trial) |
| Quarterly | $99/quarter |
| Annual | $325/year |

**Target Audience:** Experienced lifters seeking muscle growth, improved movement quality, mobility integration, and sustainable training. Athletes transitioning away from high-intensity CrossFit-style training. Home gym owners and commercial gym users alike.

*Sources: Garage Gym Reviews Persist Review (2026); Functional Bodybuilding website; Marcus Filly YouTube channel.*

### Core Philosophy

Persist is built on several interlocking principles:

1. **Progressive Overload Through Multiple Levers:** Rather than simply adding weight to the bar each week, Persist manipulates load, repetitions, volume, rest periods, range of motion, tempo, frequency, and degree of difficulty across 6-week training cycles. As Filly states: "We typically don't use percentages of one rep maxes, but instead go by feel so that you can adapt to how you're feeling on a given day."

2. **Controlled Tempo as a Core Tool:** Tempo prescriptions appear everywhere in FBB programming. A notation like **32X1** means: 3 seconds down, 2-second hold at the bottom, eXplode up, 1-second pause at the top. This enforces movement quality, increases time under tension, and drives hypertrophy without requiring maximal loads—reducing injury risk.

3. **Structured Effort Management (RPE-Based):** Rather than fixed percentages, Persist uses RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) and rep ranges. For example, a squat progression might call for building across sets at RPE 6 → 7 → 8, followed by a back-off set at 80% of the top weight for max reps. This allows athletes to auto-regulate daily.

4. **Integrated Recovery:** Mobility and active recovery are not afterthoughts—they are embedded into warm-ups, cool-downs, and 2–3 dedicated mobility sessions per week. Filly's personal experience with burnout drives this emphasis on sustainable training volume.

5. **"Look Good, Move Well":** The stated goal of Persist is aesthetic and functional simultaneously—building visible muscle while maintaining (or improving) joint health, mobility, and movement competence.

*Sources: Garage Gym Reviews; Marcus Filly YouTube videos on tempo, training formats, and Pump Lift/Condition tracks.*

### Weekly Template & Training Tracks

Persist offers **five distinct tracks**, all running on **6-week training cycles** that build progressively. Athletes are encouraged to stay on one track for the full cycle. Future workouts are released one week at a time (via Sunday email previews), not all at once.

| Track | Days/Week | Session Length | Focus | Conditioning Included? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Pillars** | 4 | ~60 min | Compound lifts (squat, bench, deadlift, OHP) + conditioning finishers | Yes (EMOMs, AMRAPs, burnout sets) |
| **Pump Condition** | 5 | ~75 min | Hypertrophy-focused lifting + conditioning at end of most sessions | Yes |
| **Pump Lift** | 5 | ~75 min | Pure hypertrophy, no conditioning | No |
| **Perform** | 5 | ~90 min | Olympic lifts + functional fitness | Yes |
| **Minimalist** | 5 | ~60 min | Minimal/no equipment workouts | Varies |

All tracks also include **2–3 dedicated mobility sessions** per week and **one full rest day**.

A typical **Pillars** weekly structure (inferred from reviewer experience and Filly's content):

| Day | Session Type |
|---|---|
| Monday | Pillars Workout A (Squat emphasis + conditioning finisher) |
| Tuesday | Mobility/Recovery |
| Wednesday | Pillars Workout B (Press emphasis + conditioning finisher) |
| Thursday | Pillars Workout C (Deadlift/Hinge emphasis + conditioning finisher) |
| Friday | Mobility/Recovery |
| Saturday | Pillars Workout D (Upper body + conditioning finisher) |
| Sunday | Full Rest |

*Note: The exact day-by-day assignment varies by cycle. From the "Persist Track Breakdown" video, we know that within Pillars, specific lifts are assigned to specific days and progress over 6 weeks (e.g., deficit deadlifts on Tuesday for 6 weeks, long pause front squats on Wednesday for weeks 1–3 transitioning to max effort work by week 6).*

*Sources: Garage Gym Reviews; Persist Track Breakdown YouTube video; Functional Bodybuilding Getting Started page.*

### Session Structure

Every Persist workout follows a consistent architecture:

1. **Warm-Up / Pre-Fatigue:** Light cardio (ski, row, run) plus movement-specific prep. Pre-fatigue targets the muscle groups of the day with higher-rep, lighter-load exercises (e.g., Bradford Z Press before a pressing session). Goal: prepare the body without fatiguing it enough to compromise the main lifts.

2. **Strength Intensity (Main Lifts):** The core of the session. Compound movements with progressive overload protocols—building sets, reverse pyramids, timed intervals, or RPE-based loading.

3. **Strength Balance (Accessories):** Supersets or agonist pairings targeting smaller muscle groups (e.g., JM Press → Inverted Skull Crushers for triceps). Higher volume, moderate intensity, shorter rest periods.

4. **Conditioning Finisher** (in applicable tracks): EMOMs, AMRAPs, or circuit-style work combining monostructural cardio with loaded movements.

5. **Hypertrophy Finisher / Cool-Down:** Drop sets, isolation work, and/or stretching/mobility.

A "Short on Time" note is provided for sessions over 60 minutes, typically reducing volume (e.g., 2 sets instead of 4) or cutting the conditioning section.

| **Hypertrophy Finisher** | Machine Leg Extension → DB Lateral Raise (superset) | 3 sets × 12–15 + 15–20; final set: drop set to failure | — | 90 sec rest between supersets; drop 30% on last set and go to failure again |

#### Sample 2: Pump Condition — Pull Day

*(From Marcus Filly's YouTube: "Pump Condition Workout: Lift & Condition to Build More Muscle")*

| Section | Exercise | Sets × Reps | Tempo | Rest / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Aerobic Bodybuilding** | Row 300m → Bent Over Rear Delt Fly × 10–15 → Dual KB Hang Clean High Pull × 10–15 | 4 rounds | — | Moderate pace; continuous |
| **SuperSet 1 (Strength Intensity)** | T-Bar Row 6–8 reps → Max Reps Pull-Up to Failure (switch grips each set) | Every 3:30–4:00 × 4 sets | 21X0 (T-Bar Row) | 15 sec rest between exercises; rest remainder of interval |

#### Sample 3: Back Squat Progression — Intensity + Back-Off Set

*(From Marcus Filly's YouTube: "3 Training Formats to Maximize Muscle")*

| Set | Reps | Tempo | RPE | Rest |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Warm-up sets (2–4) | Variable | 20X1 | Light | As needed |
| Working Set 1 | 6 | 20X1 | 6/10 | Every 2:30 (running clock) |
| Working Set 2 | 6 | 20X1 | 7/10 | Every 2:30 |
| Working Set 3 (Top Set) | 6 | 20X1 | 8/10 | Every 2:30 |
| Back-Off Set 4 | AMRAP | 20X0 (no pause at top or bottom—continuous tension) | Max effort | — |

*Back-Off Set uses 80% of Set 3 weight. Zero pauses between reps to maintain constant tension.*

#### Sample 4: Reverse Pyramid — Cyclist Front Squat

*(From Marcus Filly's YouTube: "3 Training Formats to Maximize Muscle")*

| Set | Reps | Tempo | Load | Rest |

*Progressive overload: beat Set 1 weight each time the exercise recurs (every other week in this cycle).*

#### Sample 5: Agonist Superset — Triceps

*(From Marcus Filly's YouTube: "3 Training Formats to Maximize Muscle")*

| Exercise | Sets × Reps | Tempo | Rest |
|---|---|---|---|
| JM Press | 3 × 8–10 | 30X0 | 15 sec transition to next exercise |
| DB Skull Crusher (lying tricep extension) | 3 × 12–15 | — | Rest until 3:30 mark; repeat |

*Progresses across the cycle with similar but different movements (e.g., narrow grip bench press + seated OH tricep extension the following week).*

### Hyrox Applicability Analysis

**What Transfers Well:**

- **Movement Quality & Durability:** The tempo-controlled, RPE-based approach builds resilient connective tissue and movement competency. For Hyrox athletes who need to perform sled pushes, lunges, and wall balls under extreme fatigue, this foundation of movement quality is highly transferable. Poorly executed movement under fatigue leads to time loss and injury.
- **Conditioning Integration (Pump Condition / Pillars):** The conditioning finishers—especially those combining rowing, loaded carries, kettlebell work, and bodyweight movements in timed intervals—have structural similarities to Hyrox station demands.
- **Superset & Time-Domain Training:** Persist's use of EMOM, timed supersets, and every-X-minutes formats teaches pacing under metabolic stress—a skill directly relevant to Hyrox transitions.
- **Unilateral Work & Lunge Variations:** Extensive use of single-leg work (drop lunges, split squats) directly supports the lunge station in Hyrox.
- **Farmers Carry & Loaded Movement:** Programmed regularly in conditioning sections.
- **Recovery Architecture:** The embedded mobility sessions and sustainable volume approach help prevent the overtraining that often plagues athletes trying to balance multiple training modalities.

**What's Missing:**

- **No Running Programming:** Persist has zero dedicated running. For Hyrox, where athletes run 8 × 1 km between stations, this is a critical gap. Running accounts for roughly half of total Hyrox race time.
- **No Hyrox-Specific Movements:** No sled push/pull, no wall balls, no rowing for calories (though rowing appears occasionally in conditioning), no burpee broad jumps, no ski erg intervals.
- **Limited Aerobic Base Development:** While Pump Condition includes conditioning, it is not designed to build the sustained aerobic capacity needed for a 60–75 minute Hyrox race. The conditioning is supplementary, not primary.
- **No Race-Specific Periodization:** Persist runs on continuous 6-week cycles with no taper, peak, or race-day preparation structure.

**Key Programming Principles to Extract for an AI Coach:**

1. **Tempo prescriptions as a tool for movement quality and injury prevention** (especially valuable during high-fatigue Hyrox training blocks).
2. **RPE-based loading with rep ranges** rather than fixed percentages—enables auto-regulation when combined with running fatigue.
3. **The Pre-Fatigue → Strength Intensity → Strength Balance → Conditioning Finisher session architecture** is a transferable framework.
4. **Agonist supersets for efficient volume accumulation** in time-constrained sessions.
5. **Integrated mobility as a non-negotiable** training component, not an afterthought.
6. **Progressive overload through varied stimuli** (tempo changes, range of motion, rest manipulation)—not just load increases.

## 2. Nick Bare's Hybrid Athlete Approach

### Creator Background

Nick Bare is a U.S. Army veteran (Infantry Platoon Leader, Ranger School graduate), founder of Bare Performance Nutrition (BPN), and arguably the most prominent figure in the hybrid athlete movement. His athletic resume includes a **2:48 marathon PR** (some sources cite 2:39), completion of the **Leadville 100-mile ultramarathon**, an **Ironman triathlon**, a **bodybuilding competition**, and a **9th place finish in the Hyrox Pro Division in Dallas** with a time of 1:05:42 (top 8% of all-time Hyrox Pro times).

Bare's origin story mirrors the hybrid athlete ethos: after leaving the military, he focused purely on bodybuilding/powerlifting and realized he was "missing something vital"—cardiovascular conditioning and functional ability. He returned to running and has spent the years since 2018 developing his methodology for combining high-volume running with serious strength training.

His philosophy: **"Hybrid athlete training is the best way to train. The reason it's the best lies directly in the results. Improved body composition, longevity, and it's sustainable."**

*Sources: Nick Bare website (nickbare.com/training); Generation Iron profile; Men's Health interview; Playbook app program listing; John Get Strong Substack analysis.*

### Training Philosophy

Bare's approach centers on several key principles:

1. **Two-a-Days as the Default:** Morning runs and evening strength training, allowing the body to recover between modalities and giving each session proper focus.

2. **Don't Add—Replace:** When adding running to a strength program, Bare advises cutting lifting from 5 days to 3 and adding 2–3 running days, rather than simply piling on more total sessions. "Whether you're just strength training or you're training hybrid, you need to start by deciding how many days you can truly commit to your workouts."

3. **Start Slow, Build Gradually:** A recommended starting point is 4 training days per week, held for at least 4 weeks before adding a 5th day or two-a-day sessions.

4. **Stimulate, Don't Obliterate:** Referenced repeatedly in his Hyrox preparation podcast (Episode 092), this principle emphasizes getting the training stimulus needed without destroying recovery capacity—critical when managing concurrent running and lifting stress.

5. **Auto-Regulation:** Bare emphasizes adjusting training based on how the body responds, especially during demanding preparation blocks.

6. **Purposeful Training:** Every session should have a clear objective. "Purpose-driven training sessions" was a key lesson from his Hyrox preparation.

### Weekly Training Structure

Nick Bare's training structure has evolved over the years depending on his current goal (marathon, ultramarathon, Hyrox, general hybrid fitness). The research data provides two distinct snapshots:

#### Current Training Split (October 2024 — Hyrox-Focused Phase)

*(From YouTube: "My Weekly Hybrid Athlete Training Split," Oct 31, 2024)*

| Day | Morning Session | Afternoon Session |
|---|---|---|
| **Monday** | 10 easy miles | Hyrox circuit training |
| **Tuesday** | — | Upper body strength + core |
| **Wednesday** | Tempo or track workout (10–12 miles) | Lower body strength |
| **Thursday** | 10 easy miles | Hyrox circuit training |
| **Friday** | ~8 easy miles | Upper body strength + core |
| **Saturday** | Long run + accessory work | — |
| **Sunday** | 8–10 easy miles | — |

**Weekly running mileage: ~65 miles/week**

This is an extremely high-volume training schedule reflecting Bare's advanced fitness level and years of progressive base building. The structure reveals several important design choices:

- **Easy runs dominate:** 4 of the 6 running days are easy-pace efforts, consistent with the 80/20 polarized training model.
- **Only one quality run session per week:** The Wednesday tempo/track workout is the sole high-intensity running session.
- **Hyrox circuits appear twice weekly:** Monday and Thursday afternoons, providing sport-specific preparation.
- **Strength training 3× per week:** Upper/upper/lower split, prioritizing the sessions that support Hyrox performance.
- **Sunday as a "recovery run" day:** Not a full rest day, but a lower-volume easy run without afternoon lifting.

#### Hybrid Athlete 1.0 Program (General Hybrid Training Template)

*(From Playbook app listing)*

| Day | AM Session | PM Session |
|---|---|---|
| **Day 1** | Easy Run | Push Strength |
| **Day 2** | Easy Run | Pull Strength |
| **Day 3** | Interval Run | Lower Body Strength |
| **Day 4** | Optional Aerobic Workout | Dedicated Mobility |
| **Day 5** | Threshold Run | Upper Body Hypertrophy |
| **Day 6** | Rest | Dedicated Mobility |
| **Day 7** | Easy Run | Lower Body Hypertrophy |

**Key differences from the Hyrox-focused split:** 5 weight training sessions vs. 3; 5 running workouts vs. 6–7; 2 dedicated mobility days; no sport-specific circuit work. This represents a more balanced, general-purpose hybrid template with roughly equal emphasis on strength and running.

#### Marathon Training Block Periodization

*(From Nebraska Food Cooperative PDF)*

Bare's marathon plans typically span **16–20 weeks** with the following structure:

- **Weekly mileage:** Starts at 15–20 miles/week, builds to 40–50 miles/week at peak (weeks 12–14).
- **Long runs:** Progressive, increasing ~10% per week, peaking at 20–22 miles before a taper.
- **3 quality runs per week:** Track repeats (400m/800m intervals), tempo runs (75–85% max HR), and the long run.
- **2 aerobic cross-training days:** Swimming, rowing, or stationary bike for endurance without running impact.
- **Taper phase:** Reduced volume in final 2–3 weeks before race day.

### Representative Sample Workouts / Training Days

#### Sample Day 1: Hyrox-Phase Monday (Inferred from Oct 2024 Split)

| Time | Session | Details |
|---|---|---|
| 5:00 AM | Easy Run | 10 miles at conversational pace |
| PM | Hyrox Circuit | Sled push, sled pull, wall balls, burpee broad jumps, farmers carry, rowing — sport-specific preparation (exact prescriptions not publicly available) |

#### Sample Day 2: Pull Strength (from Hybrid Athlete 1.0 / Generation Iron)

| Exercise | Sets × Reps | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Pull-Ups | 4 × AMRAP | Bodyweight |
| Deadlifts | 3 × 5 | Heavy — heaviest possible with good form |
| Lat Pulldowns | 4 × 8 | Superset format noted in BPN Training app |

| Superset: Seated Cable Fly + Push-Ups | 4 × 8 / 4 × AMRAP | 60–90 sec rest between supersets |
| Bodyweight Dips | 4 × 10 | — |

#### Sample Day 4: Legs (from Generation Iron)

| Exercise | Sets × Reps | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Leg Extensions | 4 × 12 | Warm-up / pre-fatigue |
| Hamstring Curls | 4 × 10 | — |
| Back Squats | 3 × 5 | Heavy |
| Hack Squats | 4 × 8 | — |
| Dumbbell Romanian Deadlifts | 4 × 10 | — |

#### Sample Day 5: Long Run Day (Saturday, from multiple sources)

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Long Run | 15–22 miles depending on training phase; progressive increase ~10%/week |
| Pacing | Conversational for most; possible progression to marathon pace in final miles |
| Accessory Work | Light accessory/mobility work post-run |

*Note: Bare's Hyrox-specific circuit workout details are referenced in podcast episodes 092 and 100 but the exact exercise prescriptions, sets, reps, and rest periods are not publicly documented in the research data. The circuits are known to include sled push, sled pull, wall balls, burpee broad jumps, farmers carry, and rowing, mirroring the Hyrox race format.*

### Hyrox Applicability Analysis

**Nick Bare's hybrid model is arguably the closest existing public training template to what a Hyrox athlete needs.** His Hyrox Pro debut performance (1:05:42, 9th of 207 in Pro Division) validates the approach.

**What Transfers Directly:**

- **High Aerobic Base:** 65 miles/week of running provides an enormous aerobic engine. Hyrox is fundamentally an aerobic event lasting 60–90 minutes, and Bare's running volume builds exactly the metabolic capacity needed.
- **Two-a-Day Structure:** The AM run / PM strength (or circuit) model maps directly onto Hyrox preparation, allowing sport-specific work and base building in the same day.
- **Concurrent Strength + Endurance:** Bare has years of experience managing the interference effect between strength and endurance training. His solutions (separating sessions by 6+ hours, prioritizing recovery, auto-regulating intensity) are directly applicable.
- **Hyrox Circuit Sessions:** Twice-weekly sport-specific circuits directly target the 8 Hyrox functional stations.
- **Race Periodization Experience:** Bare has periodized for marathons (16–20 week blocks with progressive overload and taper), Ironman, and ultramarathons. This periodization knowledge translates to Hyrox race preparation.
- **Mental Toughness & Pacing:** Bare's "stimulate, don't obliterate" philosophy and emphasis on purposeful training help prevent the overtraining that commonly derails Hyrox preparation.

**What Could Be Improved for Hyrox:**

- **Running Volume May Be Excessive:** 65 miles/week is far beyond what most Hyrox athletes need. Hyrox involves only 8 km total running. The high mileage reflects Bare's marathon background rather than Hyrox optimization. A more Hyrox-specific approach might reduce running to 25–40 miles/week and add more erg work (rowing, ski erg) and functional station practice.
- **Strength Training Volume is Reduced:** In the Hyrox phase, Bare lifts only 3×/week (2 upper, 1 lower). For sled push/pull performance, which demands significant lower body and posterior chain strength, additional lower body strength work could be beneficial.
- **Hyrox-Specific Weaknesses Identified:** As the John Get Strong analysis noted, Bare lost time on sled pull, burpees, rowing, and wall balls—the more technical Hyrox-specific movements. More dedicated practice with these movements (beyond twice-weekly circuits) could improve performance.
- **Public Program Lacks Specificity:** While Bare's personal training is well-documented via YouTube, the publicly available Hybrid Athlete 1.0 program on Playbook is a general hybrid template—it does not include Hyrox-specific work.

**Key Programming Principles to Extract for an AI Coach:**

1. **AM/PM split for concurrent training** — separate running and strength by maximum time to minimize interference.
2. **Polarized running distribution** — mostly easy runs with 1–2 quality sessions per week.
3. **Progressive mileage building** — 10% weekly increase, 16–20 week macrocycles, taper before competition.
4. **"Stimulate, don't obliterate"** — manage training stress holistically across both modalities.
5. **Auto-regulation as standard practice** — adjust based on recovery status, not rigid adherence to plan.
6. **Sport-specific circuit training** — dedicate 2 sessions/week to practicing actual race movements in race-like conditions.
7. **Four-day minimum starting point** for hybrid beginners, building to 5–6 days over 4+ weeks.
8. **Strength training uses traditional bodybuilding rep schemes** (4 × 8–12 with heavy loads) — simple, proven, effective.

## 3. BPN (Bare Performance Nutrition) Community Training

### Program Overview

Bare Performance Nutrition (BPN) is primarily a sports nutrition and supplement company founded by Nick Bare. In **February 2023**, BPN launched the **BPN Training app**, expanding beyond supplements into structured fitness programming. The app was positioned as a free, community-oriented training tool—a significant differentiator in a market dominated by paid programs.

**Key Details:**

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **Cost** | Free (unlimited access to all programming) |
| **Programs Available** | 4 programs: Hybrid Athlete, 5K, Half Marathon, Marathon |
| **Program Duration** | 12–16 weeks each |
| **Program Creators** | Nick Bare and Jeff Cunningham |
| **Platform** | Mobile app (BPN Training) |
| **Integration** | Garmin Connect compatibility for health/fitness data syncing |
| **Content** | Exercise library with video demonstrations, educational articles on fitness and nutrition |

*Sources: BusinessWire press release (Feb 2023); Silicon UK press release; BPN website; BPN Training app listing.*

### Training Philosophy

BPN Training's philosophy extends directly from Nick Bare's personal training ethos, packaged for broader accessibility:

- **"Go One More":** BPN's motivational tagline, encouraging athletes to push beyond perceived limits.
- **"Prove Yourself Right":** A 2023 campaign encouraging commitment to physically challenging goals.
- **Personalization:** Programs adapt based on fitness data (via Garmin Connect integration), adjusting to the user's fitness level over time.
- **Accessibility:** The decision to make all programming free reflects a philosophy that quality training should not be gated behind paywalls. As Nick Bare stated: "There aren't great training programs available that provide personalized, quality resources at no cost."
- **Holistic Approach:** BPN Training encompasses not just workouts but also nutritional guidance, recovery strategies, and mental well-being components.

### Available Programming

The four programs represent a progression from running-specific to hybrid:

1. **5K Program** (12–16 weeks): Entry-level running program for beginners building toward a 5K race.
2. **Half Marathon Program** (12–16 weeks): Intermediate running progression.
3. **Marathon Program** (12–16 weeks): Advanced marathon preparation following Nick Bare's methodology.
4. **Hybrid Athlete Program** (12–16 weeks): The flagship program combining running and strength training—structurally similar to the Hybrid Athlete 1.0 program available on Playbook.

The Hybrid Athlete program on BPN Training follows a **Push/Pull/Lower** strength training split combined with running workouts. From the limited public footage available (YouTube: "First pull workout of the Hybrid Training Program on the new BPN Training App"), we know:

- Workouts include supersets (e.g., lat pulldown superset with low rows on pull day).
- The app provides supplement recommendations tied to each workout (e.g., Endo Pump and Flight pre-workout for a pull session).
- Exercise demonstrations with detailed instructions are provided within the app.

### Representative Sample Workouts

**Important caveat:** The BPN Training app's full workout prescriptions are not publicly documented in the research data. The app is free but requires download and account creation to access full programming. Below is what can be reconstructed from available sources:

#### Sample 1: Hybrid Athlete — Pull Day (from BPN Training app YouTube)

| Exercise | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Lat Pulldown | Superset with Low Row | Reps/sets not publicly specified |
| Low Row | Superset with Lat Pulldown | — |
| Additional pulling movements | — | Full workout visible only in-app |

*This is incomplete—the YouTube video shows fragments of the workout but does not document the full prescription.*

#### Sample 2: Hybrid Athlete — Push Day (from Hybrid Athlete 1.0 on Playbook / YouTube "Block 2")

*(Inferred from program structure—the BPN app's Hybrid Athlete program appears to follow similar programming to Bare's Playbook version)*

| Exercise | Sets × Reps | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Push-day exercises (bench press variations, dumbbell presses, dips, etc.) | 4 × 8–12 typical | "There's not gonna be bench press involved" in Block 2 push day—indicating exercise rotation across blocks |

#### Sample 3: Hybrid Athlete — Weekly Structure (from Playbook listing)

This is the same weekly template documented under Nick Bare's section:

| Day | AM | PM |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Easy Run | Push Strength |
| 2 | Easy Run | Pull Strength |
| 3 | Interval Run | Lower Body Strength |
| 4 | Optional Aerobic | Dedicated Mobility |
| 5 | Threshold Run | Upper Body Hypertrophy |
| 6 | Rest | Dedicated Mobility |
| 7 | Easy Run | Lower Body Hypertrophy |

### Additional Features

- **Exercise Library:** Comprehensive, with video demonstrations and written instructions for proper form.
- **Educational Content:** Articles and guides on fitness and nutrition written by industry experts.
- **Community Component:** Online community for motivation and accountability.
- **Tracking:** Workout logging, progress tracking with sharing capabilities.
- **Scalability:** Programs include beginner and intermediate/advanced versions for running workouts.

### Hyrox Applicability Analysis

**What Transfers:**

- **Hybrid Athlete Framework:** The BPN Hybrid Athlete program provides a solid general template for concurrent strength and running training—the foundation of any Hyrox preparation program.
- **Free Access + Garmin Integration:** The zero-cost model and Garmin Connect compatibility make it an accessible entry point for athletes exploring hybrid training.
- **Running Program Expertise:** The 5K, Half Marathon, and Marathon programs demonstrate structured running periodization knowledge that supports the aerobic development needed for Hyrox.
- **Community & Accountability:** The social/community features support long-term adherence.

**What's Missing — A Significant Gap:**

- **No Hyrox-Specific Programming:** As of the available data, BPN Training does not offer a Hyrox-specific program. The four available programs (Hybrid Athlete, 5K, Half Marathon, Marathon) do not include sled push/pull, wall balls, burpee broad jumps, ski erg, or any of the 8 Hyrox functional fitness stations.
- **Limited Public Workout Detail:** Despite being free, the full workout prescriptions are only visible within the app itself. The research data does not provide enough detail to fully evaluate the quality of the programming (tempo prescriptions, progressive overload structure, periodization model).
- **No Conditioning/Functional Fitness Integration:** The Hybrid Athlete program appears to separate running and strength training cleanly—there is no equivalent to Persist's conditioning finishers or Bare's Hyrox circuit sessions.
- **General-Purpose Design:** The programs are designed for broad accessibility, not competition-specific preparation. This makes them valuable for building a base but insufficient for direct Hyrox preparation.

**Key Programming Principles to Extract for an AI Coach:**

1. **Free, accessible programming as an onboarding mechanism** — lower barriers to entry for beginners.
2. **Garmin Connect / wearable integration** for adaptive programming based on real physiological data.
3. **Scaled programming versions** (beginner vs. intermediate/advanced) within the same program structure.
4. **Supplement integration as a value-add** (relevant for a commercial coaching product, though secondary to training quality).
5. **Push/Pull/Lower split** as a proven, simple strength training framework for hybrid athletes.

## Synthesis: Key Principles for an AI Hyrox Coach

Drawing across all three programs, the following principles emerge as foundational for an AI coaching system targeting Hyrox preparation:

1. **Concurrent Training Architecture (from Bare):** AM/PM splits separating running from strength/circuits; polarized running distribution (80% easy / 20% quality); progressive mileage building with taper.

2. **Movement Quality & Tempo Control (from Filly):** Tempo prescriptions for injury-proofing and muscle development; RPE-based auto-regulation rather than fixed percentages; structured session architecture (warm-up → main lift → accessories → conditioning).

3. **Sport-Specific Circuit Integration (from Bare's Hyrox phase):** 2× weekly Hyrox-specific circuit sessions practicing actual race movements (sled push/pull, wall balls, burpee broad jumps, farmers carry, rowing, ski erg) in race-simulated conditions.

4. **Progressive Overload Through Multiple Variables (from Filly):** Load, reps, tempo, rest, range of motion, and exercise complexity as independent levers for progression—not just weight on the bar.

5. **Recovery as a First-Class Training Component (from Filly + Bare):** Dedicated mobility sessions, embedded warm-up/cool-down protocols, and the "stimulate, don't obliterate" philosophy to manage the uniquely high demands of concurrent training.

6. **Adaptive Scaling (from BPN):** Programming that adjusts to user fitness level, with beginner/intermediate/advanced versions of the same framework, enabled by wearable data integration.

7. **Periodization for Race Day (from Bare):** 16–20 week macrocycles with progressive volume building, peak training at weeks 12–14, and a structured taper phase—adapted from marathon methodology to suit the Hyrox competitive calendar.

An effective AI Hyrox coach would synthesize Filly's session design sophistication and movement quality emphasis with Bare's concurrent training framework and race periodization experience, while incorporating the accessibility and adaptive scaling principles demonstrated by BPN Training. The critical addition that none of these programs fully provides is a **purpose-built Hyrox periodization model** that systematically develops all 8 functional stations alongside the running demands, progressing from general physical preparation through sport-specific training to race-day peaking.

# Training Programs & Methodologies for Hyrox Race Preparation

## A Comprehensive Research Analysis for AI Coaching System Development

---

## 1. CrossFit Programming Principles

### 1.1 The CrossFit Methodology: "Constantly Varied, High-Intensity, Functional Movement"

CrossFit's core programming philosophy, as articulated by founder Greg Glassman and reiterated across CrossFit.com's mainsite and Level 1 certification materials, rests on three pillars:

- **Constantly Varied**: Workouts are never predictable. Movement patterns, time domains, loading, and modalities rotate to prevent adaptation and build broad physical preparedness.
- **High Intensity**: Intensity — defined as power output (force × distance / time) — is the primary driver of results. CrossFit prioritizes relative intensity over volume.
- **Functional Movement**: Multi-joint, compound movements that mirror real-world demands — squats, deadlifts, presses, pulls, carries, and locomotion.

**Application to Hyrox**: Hyrox demands exactly these qualities. The race is a chipper of eight 1-km runs interspersed with eight functional stations (ski erg, sled push, sled pull, burpee broad jumps, rowing, farmer's carry, sandbag lunges, wall balls). CrossFit's own official article, *"Why CrossFit Loves Hyrox"* (crossfit.com, January 2026), openly calls the Hyrox race format "one heck of a chipper" and draws direct parallels to classic benchmark WODs like Murph, Clovis, Filthy Fifty, and Glen. The article notes that "CrossFit athletes developed all metabolic pathways, allowing them to show repeated bouts of high-power output… sustained intensity in high-glycolytic events… while having the aerobic capacity to endure through a race that lasts approximately an hour" (Rochet, CrossFit.com, 2026).

### 1.2 Typical CrossFit Class Structure

A standard CrossFit class (typically 60 minutes) follows this template:

| Phase | Duration | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Warm-Up** | 10–15 min | General movement prep, specific skill activation, progressive loading |
| **Strength / Skill** | 15–20 min | Heavy barbell work (squat, deadlift, press, Olympic lifts), gymnastic skill, or specific capacity building |
| **WOD (Workout of the Day)** | 8–25 min | The conditioning piece — the heart of the session |
| **Cool-Down / Accessory** | 5–10 min | Mobility, light accessory work, breathing drills |

According to CrossFit's *Programming Basics: Part 1* (crossfit.com), coaches are taught to design workouts by first determining duration, movement functions, loading parameters, format (single modality, couplet, triplet, chipper), and priority (task vs. time). This systematic approach is something an AI coaching system should absolutely replicate.

### 1.3 Common WOD Formats

| Format | Description | Hyrox Relevance |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **AMRAP** (As Many Rounds As Possible) | Time-priority: max work in a fixed window (e.g., 20 min) | Builds pacing instincts and sustained output — critical for managing energy across 8 stations |
| **For Time** (Task Priority) | Complete prescribed work as fast as possible | Directly mirrors the Hyrox race format: finish the total work as quickly as possible |
| **EMOM** (Every Minute On the Minute) | Perform set work at the start of each minute; rest with remaining time | Teaches interval pacing and work-rest transitions — perfect for simulating run-to-station transitions |
| **Chipper** | Large volume of movements performed sequentially, no repeating | The Hyrox race IS a chipper. This is the single most transferable WOD format. |
| **Tabata** | 8 rounds of 20 sec work / 10 sec rest | Useful for anaerobic capacity but less directly applicable to Hyrox's longer time domain |

### 1.4 Classic CrossFit Workouts That Transfer Well to Hyrox Preparation

**1. "Murph"** — 1-mile run, 100 pull-ups, 200 push-ups, 300 air squats, 1-mile run (with 20-lb vest). The bookended runs with high-volume bodyweight work build exactly the kind of run-under-fatigue capacity Hyrox demands. The time domain (35–60+ min) matches Hyrox race duration.

**2. "Filthy Fifty"** — 50 reps each of 10 different exercises for time. This chipper format teaches athletes to manage effort across multiple stations, pacing through varied movement demands — the fundamental Hyrox skill.

**3. "Chad" (1000-rep chipper)** — 1,000 reps of box step-ups with a 20-lb vest. This trains sustained muscular endurance and mental fortitude through monotonous, high-volume single-movement work — directly applicable to the 100 wall balls or 100m sandbag lunges.

**4. "Glen"** — 30 clean-and-jerks, 1-mile run, 10 rope climbs, 1-mile run, 100 burpees, 1-mile run. The alternating run-and-work structure is remarkably similar to Hyrox's format.

**5. A custom EMOM 40** — e.g., 10 rounds of: Min 1: Row calories, Min 2: Wall balls, Min 3: Sled push, Min 4: Rest. This teaches sustained interval work across machines and functional movements, directly simulating Hyrox race conditions.

### 1.5 What CrossFit Programming Gets RIGHT for Hyrox

- **Work Capacity / Engine Building**: CrossFit's emphasis on sustained high-power output across varied time domains builds the aerobic and anaerobic base that underlies Hyrox performance. The sport of CrossFit literally defines fitness as "work capacity across broad time and modal domains."
- **Metabolic Conditioning**: CrossFit athletes are pre-adapted to every metabolic pathway Hyrox tests — phosphocreatine (burpee broad jumps), glycolytic (sled push/pull, rowing), and oxidative (8 km of running).
- **Mental Toughness**: Long chippers and Hero WODs build the psychological resilience needed to push through the final stations of a Hyrox race. CrossFit athletes are practiced at managing discomfort.
- **Movement Familiarity**: As CrossFit.com notes, CrossFit athletes are "no strangers to the ski erg, rower, sleds, lunges, carries, or burpee broad jumps. And we invented the wall-ball shot" (Rochet, 2026).
- **Mixed-Modal Training**: The concept of combining monostructural cardio with functional movements in a single session is a CrossFit hallmark and the very essence of Hyrox.

### 1.6 What CrossFit Programming MISSES for Hyrox

- **Running Volume**: Standard CrossFit programming includes runs of 200m–1600m within WODs, but rarely prescribes dedicated running sessions. CompTrain includes running 2–3 times per week (comptrain.com/gym-programming-principles), which is ahead of most, but even this is insufficient for the 8 km total running in Hyrox. Mat Fraser himself admitted after his first Hyrox: "The stations I was keeping up just fine. But on the running, there were a couple times I was like, 'O'Keefe, chill'" (BoxLife Magazine, 2025).
- **Specific Station Work**: CrossFit rarely programs 50m sled pushes at Hyrox weights, 100m sandbag lunges, or 200m farmer's carries at prescribed loads. The volume and specificity of these movements differ significantly from CrossFit's approach.
- **Pacing Strategy**: CrossFit often rewards all-out intensity. Hyrox demands strategic pacing across 60–90+ minutes. An athlete who redlines on the sled push may lose minutes on subsequent runs — a skill CrossFit doesn't explicitly train.
- **Aerobic Base / Zone 2 Work**: CrossFit rarely prescribes dedicated low-intensity aerobic sessions. Hyrox performance is heavily dependent on aerobic capacity, which requires deliberate Zone 2 training.
- **Periodization for a Known Event**: CrossFit's "constantly varied" philosophy means it rarely peaks athletes for a specific event. Hyrox athletes need periodized 8–16 week blocks that culminate in race-day readiness.

**AI Coach Takeaway**: Steal CrossFit's chipper and EMOM formats, its scaling methodology, its emphasis on functional movement standards, and its mental toughness development. But layer in dedicated running programming, station-specific practice, and deliberate pacing education.

## 2. Hyrox Official Training Programs

### 2.1 Hyrox Official Training Partnerships

Hyrox does not produce a single, proprietary training app in the way CrossFit.com provides mainsite programming. Instead, Hyrox operates through **Official Online Training Partners**, listed on hyrox.com/hyrox-online-training-partners/. As of 2025–2026, these partners include:

**LEVLS** — The primary official Hyrox training partner. LEVLS offers two main programs:
- **HYROX Race**: A structured, progressive program building toward a specific race date, incorporating all 8 station movements with benchmark workouts.
- **HYROX Daily**: Ongoing training for year-round Hyrox fitness.

LEVLS uses "tried and tested progressive methodology" with benchmark workouts at each station to track improvements. The programs include structured training blocks, performance tracking, and the ability to target individual station weaknesses. LEVLS is app-based and represents the closest thing to an "official Hyrox program."

**Endur** — Partnered with Hyrox World Champion Alexander Roncevic, offering step-by-step audio and video coaching for Open and Pro categories.

**Relentless Method** — Offers personalized Hyrox training with AI adaptation, adjusting to athlete ability, equipment, and schedule. Athletes choose between fitness-focused or race-intense plans.

**Centr** — Chris Hemsworth's platform became an official Hyrox partner offering certified race-specific programs integrated with nutrition, recovery, and mindset coaching. It's a holistic platform but more generalist than specialized (ChAIron.app analysis, 2025).

### 2.2 Hyrox Academy & Master Trainer Ecosystem

Hyrox has developed a multi-level education and certification system through the **Hyrox Academy** (documented on roxlyfe.com/hyrox-365):
- **HYROX Foundation Course** ("Get Race Ready") — Entry-level certification for coaches
- **Level 1–4 Education Courses** — Progressive qualification covering periodization, biomechanics, nutrition, business strategy, and race development
- These certifications create "HYROX Performance Coaches" who implement the Hyrox methodology in gyms worldwide

The Hyrox Academy covers all aspects of athlete and performance development and is "written by industry and science-backed experts, all delivered through an innovative LMS system" (Roxlyfe, 2024). This ecosystem is important for AI coaches to understand because it establishes standardized coaching principles for the sport.

### 2.3 HAOS Training (Hunter McIntyre's Platform)

HAOS (Hunter's Academy of Strength) is built by multiple-time OCR World Champion Hunter McIntyre, who holds the Hyrox world record and MURPH world record. Key details (hyroxtrainingplans.com):

- **Price**: $39.99/month
- **Structure**: 6 days/week, ~100 min/session, 10 hours/week total commitment
- **Four Progressive Programs**: Intro Athlete → Strength → Run → Pro
- **Cycle Length**: 8–12 weeks per program phase
- **Philosophy**: A "proven yearly periodization model that maximizes agility, allowing you to build strength and endurance so you can quickly reach peak performance for any event" (pro.haostraining.com)
- **Key Differentiator**: HAOS trains for multiple racing disciplines (Spartan, Hyrox, CrossFit, Trail Running) and emphasizes the ability to pivot between sports — a generalist-specialist hybrid approach

HAOS also offers 1-on-1 coaching through Hunter McIntyre and Parker Gregory for athletes wanting individualized programming.

**AI Coach Takeaway**: HAOS's four-level progressive structure is an excellent template for an AI system — athletes self-select their level and advance systematically. The yearly periodization model that accommodates multiple race types is particularly valuable for athletes who compete in Hyrox seasonally.

### 2.4 Roxlyfe

Roxlyfe offers a popular **12-Week Hyrox Training Plan** (roxlyfe.com/12-week-training-plan/) with extensive user testimonials. Key features:
- **Multi-level scaling**: Workouts include difficulty levels so athletes can progress within the plan
- **Weekly Hyrox simulation**: One dedicated session per week mimics race conditions — a major confidence builder
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Runs of varying speeds/lengths, interval training, strength work, and Hyrox-specific simulations
- **Accessible price point**: Designed for non-professional athletes
- **Results**: Users report improvements of 3:30–5:30+ on race times, with personal bests across multiple stations

One testimonial captures the plan's appeal: "The Rox Lyfe program was everything I was looking for in a hybrid training program — thoughtful, comprehensive, challenging, and accessible to non-professional athletes" (Roxlyfe testimonials, 2025).

### 2.5 Other Notable Hyrox-Specific Programs

- **RMR Training** (rmr.training): Offers a 12-week flagship Hyrox program with native leaderboards, long-form video guidance, and community features. Host Rich Ryan's podcast covers structured programming for Hyrox including progressive overload, aerobic work, strength, and rest management.
- **ChAIron**: AI-powered training app claiming 30–40% improved race-day pacing accuracy through real-time form feedback and adaptive difficulty (ChAIron, 2025). Represents the frontier of AI coaching for Hyrox.
- **PRVN HYROX**: Tia-Clair Toomey and Shane Orr's PRVN has launched a dedicated Hyrox track with daily programming, 8-week cycles, race-day prep programs, and scaling options for all levels. Coached by James Kelly. Priced at $45/month.
- **HWPO HYROX**: Mat Fraser's HWPO offers a Hyrox prep track (5x/week standalone or 2x/week layered with other training), included with HWPO All Access membership. Sessions average ~60 minutes.

**AI Coach Takeaway**: The most successful Hyrox programs share these DNA traits: (1) structured periodization in 8–12 week blocks, (2) weekly race simulation sessions, (3) scalable difficulty levels, (4) integration of running and station work, and (5) progressive benchmarking. An AI coach should embed all five.

## 3. Running Programs for Hybrid Athletes

### 3.1 The 80/20 Running Principle (Matt Fitzgerald)

Matt Fitzgerald's *80/20 Running* (2014) synthesizes decades of exercise science into one actionable framework: **80% of training volume should be at low intensity (Zone 1–2), and only 20% at moderate-to-high intensity (Zone 3–5)**. This "polarized training" model, pioneered by exercise physiologist Dr. Stephen Seiler, is supported by robust evidence:

- **Seiler & Kjerland (2006)**: World and Olympic Champion endurance athletes spend approximately 75–80% of training time at low intensity, despite racing at much higher intensities.
- **Helgerud et al. (2007)**: 4×4-minute intervals at 90–95% max HR produced **10.8% VO₂ max improvement** vs. only 3.5% for long slow distance — nearly 3× the improvement.
- **Stöggl & Sperlich (2014)**: After 9 weeks, the polarized group showed superior improvements in 10k time trial, VO₂ max, running economy, AND lactate threshold vs. threshold-only training. The threshold group actually declined in some metrics.

Source: HyroxDataLab.com, *"How to Structure Your HYROX Running Training"* (2025), which provides an excellent evidence-based summary with full citations.

### 3.2 Applying 80/20 to a Hyrox Athlete at 35–40 MPW

A Hyrox athlete running 35–40 miles per week (a serious but achievable volume for competitive racers) would distribute approximately:

- **28–32 miles in Zone 2** (easy, conversational pace — 60–70% max HR)
- **7–8 miles in Zone 4–5** (tempo and interval work — 75–95% max HR)

This volume is higher than most Hyrox programs prescribe (most recommend 3–4 runs/week totaling 15–25 miles). Athletes at this mileage are likely targeting sub-60 or sub-55 minute Hyrox times where running split optimization becomes the primary performance lever.

### 3.3 Sample Week Structure for a Hybrid Athlete (35–40 MPW)

| Day | Running Session | Hyrox / Strength | Total Running |
|-----|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Monday** | Easy Run, 6 mi (Zone 2) | — | 6 mi |
| **Tuesday** | Easy Run, 5 mi (Zone 2) | PM: Hyrox Station Work (sled, row, wall balls) | 5 mi |
| **Wednesday** | Tempo Run, 7 mi (2 mi warm-up, 3 mi tempo @ 75–85% HR, 2 mi cooldown) | — | 7 mi |
| **Thursday** | Recovery Run, 4 mi (Zone 1) | PM: Strength (squat, deadlift, press) | 4 mi |
| **Friday** | Intervals, 6 mi total (2 mi warm-up, 5×4 min @ 90–95% HR w/3 min jog, 2 mi cooldown) | — | 6 mi |
| **Saturday** | Easy Run, 5 mi (Zone 2) | Hyrox Race Simulation (compromised running + stations) | 5 mi |
| **Sunday** | Long Run, 8–10 mi (Zone 2) | — | 8–10 mi |
| **Weekly Total** | | | **~39–43 mi** |

**Key principles**: Easy days are truly easy. Hard days (Wednesday tempo, Friday intervals) are genuinely hard. Station work is placed on separate days or in PM sessions to allow morning running quality. The long run builds aerobic infrastructure. The Saturday simulation teaches compromised running (running immediately after heavy station work).

### 3.4 Polarized Training Model for Hybrid Athletes

The challenge for hybrid athletes doing both running and Hyrox station work is that **station work IS high-intensity training**. A heavy sled push session or a 100-rep wall ball set imposes significant physiological stress. This means:

- Station work days should be counted in the "20% hard" bucket
- Easy running days must be deliberately slow to compensate
- Total training stress (running + lifting + stations) must be managed holistically
- An athlete doing 3 hard station sessions plus 2 hard runs is at 5 high-intensity sessions/week — almost certainly too much

The practical recommendation from Hyrox Data Lab (2025) is: **3 running sessions + 2 Hyrox strength sessions per week**, with one of the three runs being Zone 2, one tempo, and one intervals. This represents a polarized approach where the 80% easy work comes from Zone 2 running and recovery days, while the 20% hard comes from tempo runs, intervals, AND station work combined.

### 3.5 Key Running Workouts Every Hyrox Athlete Should Do

**1. Zone 2 Long Run (60–90 minutes)**
- The aerobic engine builder. Increases mitochondrial density, improves fat oxidation (preserving glycogen for stations), and builds capillary networks.
- Progression: Add 5–10 min every 2–3 weeks until reaching 90 min. Don't exceed 90 min — this isn't marathon training.
- Practice race nutrition during long runs.

**2. Tempo Run (20–40 minutes at 75–85% max HR)**
- Raises lactate threshold and teaches the body to sustain "comfortably hard" effort. This pace approximates the average Hyrox running pace between stations.
- Should feel hard but sustainable — "short sentences only" on the talk test.

**3. VO₂ Max Intervals (4–8 × 3–4 min at 90–95% max HR)**
- The research-backed "magic protocol": 4×4 minutes at 90–95% max HR with 3-min active recovery (Helgerud et al., 2007).
- Maximizes VO₂ max — the ceiling that determines performance under extreme fatigue in late-race stations.

**4. Easy Runs (30–50 minutes, Zone 1–2)**
- Recovery runs that accumulate volume without adding stress. These are the "80%" that makes the "20%" possible.
- Common mistake: running these too hard. If you can't hold a full conversation, slow down.

**5. Compromised Running (Hyrox-specific)**
- Running immediately after station work (e.g., 50m sled push → immediate 1 km run).
- Teaches pacing under peripheral and central fatigue — the unique skill Hyrox demands that no pure running program addresses.
- Fraser structures this as: "800m run → row → 800m run → rest → 800m run → ski erg → 800m run" (BoxLife Magazine, 2025).

**AI Coach Takeaway**: Steal the 80/20 distribution as the governing principle for total training load. Implement Zone 2 running as non-negotiable daily programming for aerobic base. Use the 4×4 interval protocol for VO₂ max development. Most importantly, introduce "compromised running" as a Hyrox-specific training modality that pure running programs miss entirely.

## 4. COMPARISON MATRIX: All Programs Analyzed

This is the critical synthesis deliverable. The matrix below evaluates each program across standardized dimensions relevant to Hyrox race preparation.

### 4.1 Full Comparison Table

| Program | Focus Area | Sessions/Week | Conditioning Style | Strength Method | Running Component | Hyrox Readiness (1–10) | Best For |
|---------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------|
| **PRVN (CrossFit Track)** | General physical preparedness via CrossFit methodology; strength + conditioning | 5–6 | Mixed-modal metcons, AMRAPs, EMOMs, chippers; broad time domains (5–35 min) | Systematic barbell cycles (squat, deadlift, press, Olympic lifts); progressive overload across 8-week cycles | Limited within WODs (200–800m runs); not programmed as dedicated sessions | **5/10** — Elite GPP base and movement familiarity, but lacks dedicated running volume, station-specific work, and Hyrox pacing practice | CrossFit competitors wanting broad fitness; athletes using it as a GPP base who will add Hyrox-specific layers |
| **PRVN (Hyrox Track)** | Hyrox-specific: sled power, carry strength, run durability, station efficiency | 5–7 (daily programming) | Race-focused: run intervals, sled work, rowing, ski erg, wall balls; 8-week structured cycles | Integrated functional strength for carry/sled/lunge capacity; less pure barbell focus than CrossFit track | Run intervals and tempo sessions built into programming; more running than CrossFit track | **8/10** — Purpose-built by Toomey/Orr/Kelly; structured cycles, scaling options, race-day prep. Missing only ultra-high running volume for sub-55 athletes | Dedicated Hyrox competitors at all levels; CrossFit athletes transitioning to Hyrox |
| **HWPO Flagship** | Elite CrossFit performance; strength, Oly lifting, rowing, conditioning | 5 + 1 active recovery + 1 rest | Metcons (12–20 min), EMOM work, dedicated rowing/bike erg pieces; interval-based with forced breaks | Heavy: squat 2×/wk, deadlift 1×/wk, bench 1×/wk, Oly lifts 3×/wk; percentage-based progressive cycles | Minimal — running appears within WODs but no structured running program | **4/10** — Builds massive work capacity, rowing endurance, and mental toughness. But sessions are 1:45–2:00 hrs, running is neglected, and Hyrox-specific stations aren't trained. Overkill on Oly lifting. | CrossFit competitors and advanced fitness enthusiasts wanting Fraser-level programming intensity |
| **HWPO Hyrox** | Hyrox race preparation layered onto HWPO base | 5×/wk standalone OR 2×/wk add-on | Hyrox-specific conditioning: race simulation, station work, compromised cardio | Functional strength oriented toward Hyrox station demands | Integrated — running is central to the programming; Fraser explicitly prioritizes running ("Priority one") | **7/10** — Leverages Fraser's elite programming mind for Hyrox specifics. Available as add-on (flexible). But newer program; less track record than established Hyrox platforms. ~60 min sessions are efficient. | HWPO members wanting Hyrox prep; CrossFit athletes with limited time for a second program |
| **CompTrain** | Sustainable general fitness; accessible CrossFit programming for gym classes | 6 (Mon–Sat) | Balanced: 8–18 min conditioning + strength days, 20–35 min longer conditioning days, team workouts Saturday | Weekly: press, pull (deadlift), squat; biannual benchmark testing (24 WODs/year) | **Running 2–3×/week** at varying intensities/distances — a standout among CrossFit programs | **5/10** — Best pure CrossFit program for running integration. Sustainable intensity model. But no Hyrox-specific station work, race simulation, or periodization toward a Hyrox event. | Gym owners/members wanting quality group programming; athletes who want running-inclusive CrossFit |
| **Persist (Marcus Filly)** | Functional bodybuilding: hypertrophy + mobility + controlled conditioning | 4–5 | Conditioning finishers (EMOMs, AMRAPs, burnout sets); not the primary focus. Perform track = 90-min sessions with more conditioning | Progressive overload across squat, bench, deadlift, press; tempo work, controlled eccentrics, range-of-motion emphasis; 6-week cycles | Essentially none — running is not programmed | **2/10** — Excellent for building muscular endurance, mobility, and structural balance. But almost zero conditioning transfer, no running, no Hyrox-specific work. Useful only as a supplementary hypertrophy program. | Athletes needing to build muscle mass, improve movement quality, or recover from injury while maintaining training |
| **Nick Bare Hybrid Athlete** | Running + lifting for "optimal health, performance, and longevity" | 7 (5 lifting + 5 running + 2 mobility; most days = two-a-days) | Minimal structured conditioning; the "conditioning" comes from high running volume + lifting density | Hypertrophy-focused: push/pull/lower body split; bodybuilding exercise selection (not functional movements) | **Extensive**: 5 runs/week including easy runs, intervals, threshold runs, and weekly long run; ~5 mi/day minimum | **5/10** — Outstanding running volume and endurance base. But strength programming is bodybuilding, not functional (no sleds, carries, wall balls). No race simulation. Requires extreme time commitment (two-a-days). | Endurance-curious lifters who want to run marathons/halfs while maintaining muscle; NOT optimized for Hyrox-specific demands |
| **CrossFit Mainsite** | Broad GPP; "unknown and unknowable" preparedness | 5–6 | Maximum variance: every WOD format (AMRAP, For Time, EMOM, chipper, Tabata); time domains from 3–40+ min | Embedded in WODs — heavy days for squat, deadlift, press, clean, snatch; no structured linear progression | Occasional 400m–1600m runs within WODs; no dedicated running program | **4/10** — Builds incredible general fitness and movement competency across all Hyrox stations. But zero running specificity, no periodization, no Hyrox race simulation. Great starting point; insufficient for serious competitors. | General fitness enthusiasts; athletes wanting to "show up and see what happens" at their first Hyrox |
| **80/20 Running (Fitzgerald)** | Endurance running performance via polarized intensity distribution | 3–6 running sessions | Polarized: 80% Zone 2, ~5% tempo, ~15% VO₂ max intervals; no functional conditioning | None — purely a running methodology | **Comprehensive**: long runs, tempo runs, VO₂ max intervals, easy runs; scalable from 20–60+ MPW | **3/10** — Provides the optimal running methodology for Hyrox but offers zero strength, conditioning, or station work. An AI coach should use 80/20 as the RUNNING ENGINE within a broader Hyrox program, not as a standalone solution. | Pure runners adding Hyrox to their race calendar; providing the running philosophy layer for any Hyrox program |
| **HAOS (Hunter McIntyre)** | Multi-sport hybrid racing (Hyrox, OCR, CrossFit, trail) | 5–6 | Race-specific: strength + running combined; progressive from intro to pro-level; yearly periodization | Functional strength built into program progression; carries, sleds, bodyweight; builds from foundation to sport-specific | Running is a core pillar (dedicated "Run" program phase); speed, endurance, and running efficiency | **7/10** — Created by one of the sport's greatest competitors; proven periodization model. Four-level system is elegant. But generalist approach (covers OCR, CrossFit, trail) means Hyrox isn't the sole focus. $40/mo for non-individualized programming. | Multi-sport athletes who race Hyrox alongside OCR or other events; athletes wanting a structured yearly plan |
| **Roxlyfe 12-Week Plan** | Hyrox race preparation for amateur/intermediate athletes | 5–6 | Hyrox-specific: runs, intervals, strength, weekly race simulations; scalable difficulty levels | Functional strength for station demands; progressive over 12 weeks | Progressive running: varying speeds/lengths, interval work, tempo sessions | **7/10** — Exceptional user testimonials (3:30–5:30 improvements). Affordable, well-structured, and specifically designed for Hyrox. Scaling options for all levels. But static program (no AI adaptation) and limited post-race ongoing programming. | First-time or intermediate Hyrox athletes wanting a proven, affordable 12-week prep plan |
| **LEVLS (Official Hyrox Partner)** | Hyrox race preparation and daily hybrid fitness | 5–6 | Progressive methodology with benchmark workouts at all 8 stations; structured training blocks | Functional strength targeting station-specific demands | Integrated running as part of Hyrox race preparation | **8/10** — Official Hyrox partnership provides credibility and direct alignment with race standards. Progressive benchmarking at each station is powerful for tracking. Pre-set routines lack real-time adaptation. | Athletes wanting the "official" Hyrox training experience; those who value structured, methodology-driven programming |

### 4.2 Hyrox Readiness Score Justifications

| Program | Score | Justification |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| **PRVN CrossFit** | 5/10 | Builds elite general fitness and all movement competencies, but lacks Hyrox-specific running volume, station practice, and race pacing strategy. CrossFit athletes do well at Hyrox "off the couch" (top third), but can't compete for podiums without supplementation. |
| **PRVN Hyrox** | 8/10 | Purpose-built by the world's most decorated CrossFit athlete (Toomey) and a top Hyrox specialist (Kelly); offers structured cycles, daily programming, race-day prep, and multi-level scaling. Only misses the ultra-high running volume needed for elite sub-55 times. |
| **HWPO Flagship** | 4/10 | Massive work capacity builder with elite-level barbell strength and rowing endurance, but sessions are too long (1:45–2 hrs), running is almost absent, and Olympic lifting emphasis is misallocated for Hyrox demands. |
| **HWPO Hyrox** | 7/10 | Fraser's programming expertise applied to Hyrox with running as declared priority. Flexible (2x or 5x/week). But relatively new program with less proven track record than dedicated Hyrox platforms; relies on Fraser's CrossFit background more than Hyrox-specific race experience. |
| **CompTrain** | 5/10 | Uniquely among CrossFit programs, emphasizes running 2–3×/week and sustainable intensity ("build up, not burn out"). But designed for gym classes, not individual Hyrox prep; no station-specific work or race simulation. |
| **Persist** | 2/10 | Exceptional for structural balance, hypertrophy, and mobility, but essentially zero transfer to Hyrox conditioning demands. No running, no sleds, no race simulation. Only useful as a supplementary off-season hypertrophy block. |
| **Nick Bare Hybrid** | 5/10 | Outstanding running volume (5 runs/wk, ~25–35 mi) that would build an excellent aerobic base for Hyrox. But the strength side is bodybuilding (not functional), there's no station work, and the two-a-day structure is unsustainable for most. |
| **CrossFit Mainsite** | 4/10 | Maximum variance builds readiness for anything, including Hyrox — but the lack of specificity means it's a great foundation that must be supplemented. No running program, no periodization, no race-day strategy. |
| **80/20 Running** | 3/10 | Provides the scientifically optimal running methodology, but running alone is only ~50% of Hyrox. Zero strength, zero station work, zero race simulation. Essential as a COMPONENT of a Hyrox program, not a standalone solution. |
| **HAOS** | 7/10 | World-record-holder's proven system with elegant 4-level progression and yearly periodization. Covers strength, running, and race prep. Loses a point for being multi-sport (not Hyrox-exclusive) and for being non-adaptive (same programming for all users). |
| **Roxlyfe** | 7/10 | Proven 12-week plan with exceptional user results and accessible scaling. Weekly race simulations are a standout feature. Loses points for being a static plan with no ongoing programming post-race and no AI adaptation. |
| **LEVLS** | 8/10 | Official Hyrox partnership ensures alignment with race standards and station benchmarks. Progressive methodology with structured blocks. Pre-set routines lack adaptive personalization, but the Hyrox-specific benchmarking system is best-in-class. |

## 5. What an AI Coaching System Should Steal from Each Program

### From CrossFit Programming (Mainsite / CompTrain)
- **Steal**: The WOD format library (AMRAP, EMOM, For Time, Chipper) as templates for Hyrox conditioning sessions
- **Steal**: CompTrain's principle of "intentional intensity" — programming movement pairings, loading, and rep schemes that fall into a "sweet spot for sustainable power output"
- **Steal**: The scaling methodology — offering Rx'd, scaled, and beginner versions of every workout so the AI can serve athletes at any level
- **Steal**: CompTrain's 24 benchmark workouts/year framework — create Hyrox-specific benchmarks (e.g., "1km row + 1km run for time") that repeat bimonthly for progress tracking

### From PRVN
- **Steal**: The 8-week cycle structure with built-in periodization — this is the optimal block length for Hyrox preparation

## 6. Synthesis: The Ideal AI Coaching Architecture

Based on this analysis, the optimal AI coaching system for Hyrox preparation should integrate:

1. **Running Engine**: 80/20 polarized model with 3–5 runs/week, auto-adjusting volume based on race proximity and athlete level (inspired by Fitzgerald, Hyrox Data Lab)
2. **Strength Foundation**: Percentage-based functional strength programming in 6–8 week cycles (inspired by HWPO, PRVN, Persist)
3. **Station-Specific Training**: Weekly rotation through all 8 Hyrox stations with benchmark tracking (inspired by LEVLS, Roxlyfe)
4. **Race Simulation**: Weekly chipper-style sessions mimicking full or partial Hyrox race conditions (inspired by Roxlyfe, PRVN Hyrox, CrossFit chipper WODs)
5. **Conditioning Variety**: CrossFit WOD formats (EMOM, AMRAP, For Time) used as templates for metabolic conditioning sessions (inspired by CompTrain, CrossFit Mainsite)
6. **Progressive System**: Multi-level athlete pathway from beginner to elite with auto-scaling (inspired by HAOS's 4-level system, PRVN's 3-level Compete)
7. **Periodization**: Year-round programming with 8–12 week race-prep blocks that peak for specific events (inspired by HAOS yearly model, PRVN cycles)
8. **Pacing Intelligence**: Zone-based training with HR monitoring, enforced easy days, and race-pace calibration (inspired by 80/20, Hyrox Data Lab's anti-gray-zone philosophy)

No single existing program scores a 10/10. The programs that come closest — PRVN Hyrox (8/10) and LEVLS (8/10) — still lack adaptive personalization and ultra-high running volume options. The opportunity for an AI coaching system is to synthesize the best elements from all programs into a truly personalized, adaptive Hyrox preparation experience.

## 1. Key Figures and Their Frameworks

### 1.1 Chris Hinshaw — Aerobic Capacity and the Endurance Engine

Chris Hinshaw is the founder of the Aerobic Capacity programming system and has coached over 35 CrossFit Games champions. A former Ironman triathlete himself, Hinshaw transitioned into coaching functional fitness athletes after observing a critical gap: most high-intensity training programs neglected the aerobic system entirely, relying almost exclusively on glycolytic and phosphagen energy systems. Hinshaw's central thesis — which he calls "building the engine" — is that an athlete's aerobic base is the mechanical foundation that allows all other physical capacities to express themselves at higher volumes and for longer durations.

**Core Philosophy: The Aerobic Engine**

Hinshaw's philosophy rests on several key principles drawn from his coaching experience and endurance sport background (Source: *PMPC Podcast #004, Chris Hinshaw – Aerobic Capacity Founder*, 2024; *Best Hour of Their Day* episodes 561-562; *Jedburgh Podcast*):

1. **Fast-twitch fibers create fatigue; slow-twitch fibers clear it.** During high-intensity work, fast-twitch muscle fibers produce lactate and other fatigue-inducing byproducts. Slow-twitch fibers consume that lactate as fuel. If an athlete only trains high intensity, they become excellent at *producing* lactate and working under its burden, but they never develop the capacity to *clear* it. This is the bottleneck — and the aerobic engine is the solution.

2. **If you have a 50/50 blend of fast-twitch and slow-twitch fibers and only train fast-twitch, you are leaving 50% of your available capacity passive.** Slow-twitch fibers require volume and time under tension to adapt. Short, explosive training sessions do not provide the overload stimulus these fibers need. This is especially critical for Hyrox, where the race lasts 60–90+ minutes and demands sustained output across diverse movement patterns.

3. **Every movement is unique, and every intensity within that movement is unique.** Hinshaw insists that athletes train across a "variety of intensities." Speed alone does not develop the full spectrum of the aerobic system. You must train the low end (base building, lactate clearance, capillarization), the moderate range (tempo and threshold work), and the high end (VO2max intervals) to build a complete engine.

4. **Pacing is the ultimate competitive advantage.** Hinshaw was one of the earliest advocates of pacing strategy in functional fitness. He teaches that efficiently and effectively consuming available energy through controlled pacing maximizes total performance. In Hyrox, where athletes must sustain effort across 8 km of running interspersed with 8 functional stations, pacing is not optional — it is the difference between a competitive finish and a collapse.

5. **Long-term cellular adaptation beats short-term intensity spikes.** While high-intensity protocols produce quick results, Hinshaw warns that these adaptations are "non-sustainable" and "riddled with risk." The real gains come from cellular-level adaptation: increased mitochondrial density, capillarization, improved fat oxidation, and enhanced stroke volume. These take months to develop but last far longer and provide a far higher ceiling.

**Hinshaw's Interval Prescriptions**

Hinshaw structures interval workouts around three key variables: **distance (or time), intensity, and rest**. He designs workouts with very specific intent — targeting either the aerobic system (VO2max zone, typically 6–9 minutes at maximum effort), the lactate clearance system (moderate work with active recovery), or the pacing system (controlled-split intervals). (Source: *Jedburgh Podcast*; *brUTE Strength Podcast Ep.10*)

| Protocol Type | Example Workout | Work Interval | Rest Interval | Intensity | Target Adaptation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| VO2max Intervals | 3 sets × 4 × 400m run | ~2 min per rep | 40 sec between reps, 4 min between sets | Moderate to hard pace | Aerobic capacity, oxygen utilization |
| Multi-Modal Transfer | 4 × 2 min on each of bike, row, ski (12 rounds total) | 2 min per effort | Matched to running rest periods | Sport-specific moderate pace | Cross-modal aerobic transfer, RPM matching |
| Pacing Intervals | 5 × 1 km run (even-split target) | ~4–6 min each | 2–3 min walk/jog | Controlled, aiming for identical splits | Pacing discipline, metabolic efficiency |
| Active Recovery Focus | Wall balls: 20 reps + 5 slow air squats EMOM | ~45 sec work per min | Remaining time in minute (active) | Race-weight ball, race-pace reps | Lactate clearance under continued movement |
| Aerobic Base Run | 30–60 min at conversational pace | Continuous | N/A | Zone 2 (nasal breathing capable) | Capillarization, fat oxidation, slow-twitch development |

**Hinshaw's Active Recovery Principle for Hyrox:** Rather than lying on the floor between heavy sets, Hinshaw advocates keeping the body moving at low intensity — cycling slowly, doing air squats, or walking — to encourage the slow-twitch fibers to consume the lactate produced by the fast-twitch fibers. This is directly applicable to Hyrox station-to-run transitions, where the ability to recover *while still moving* is paramount. A Hyrox-adapted version: after sled pushes, immediately transition to a slow jog for the subsequent 1 km run rather than standing still, even if the first 200m feels slow. The physiological payoff is faster lactate clearance and a lower perceived effort for the remainder of the run. (Source: YouTube, "Use Hinshaw's method to increase your reps for Hyrox," 2023)

**Hyrox Relevance:** Hinshaw's framework maps almost perfectly onto the Hyrox demand profile. A Hyrox race is an 8 km run broken into 1 km segments, interspersed with 8 functional stations. More than 60% of total race time is spent running (Brandt et al., 2025, *Frontiers in Physiology*). The ability to clear lactate during running segments after high-output stations (sled push, sled pull, wall balls) is the single most trainable limiter for most recreational Hyrox athletes.

### 1.2 Andy Galpin, PhD — Exercise Physiology and the 9 Adaptations Framework

Andy Galpin is a Professor of Kinesiology at California State University, Fullerton, and one of the foremost authorities on bridging exercise science and practical application. His six-part guest series on the *Huberman Lab Podcast* (January–February 2023) constituted a landmark body of content on fitness science, covering everything from assessment to programming to recovery. His frameworks provide the scientific scaffolding upon which an AI Hyrox coach should build all training recommendations.

**The 9 Exercise-Induced Adaptations**

Galpin categorizes the physiological outcomes of exercise into 9 distinct adaptations. Each is elicited by manipulating modifiable training variables: exercise choice, intensity, volume, rest intervals, and progressive overload. The 9 adaptations are (Source: *Huberman Lab Guest Series*, Episode 1: "How to Assess & Improve All Aspects of Your Fitness"):

| # | Adaptation | Definition | Key Training Variable | Hyrox Relevance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Skill/Technique | Moving more efficiently in specific patterns | Exercise choice, practice | Running economy, wall ball technique, sled mechanics |
| 2 | Speed | Higher velocity or rate of acceleration | Low volume, max effort, full rest | Burpee broad jump explosiveness, sled push initiation |
| 3 | Power | Speed × Force | Explosive movements, moderate load | Sled push/pull drive, wall ball power |
| 4 | Strength (Force) | Maximum force production in one effort | 3–5 reps, 3–5 sets, 3–5 min rest | Sled push/pull capacity, farmers carry load management |
| 5 | Hypertrophy | Muscle size increase | 6–30 reps, 10–20 sets/muscle/week | Functional muscle mass for load-bearing stations |
| 6 | Muscular Endurance | Reps to failure in a localized muscle group | High reps, short rest, local fatigue | Wall balls (75–100 reps), sandbag lunges |
| 7 | Anaerobic Capacity | Max work at max effort, total system fatigue | 20–120 sec all-out, full recovery | Sled push/pull, ski erg, rowing erg bursts |
| 8 | Maximal Aerobic Capacity (VO2max) | Max oxygen utilization, 8–15 min domain | Intervals at 85–95% HRmax, 3–5 min work | 1 km run splits, sustained high output across race |
| 9 | Long-Duration Endurance | Sustained sub-maximal work, 15+ min, no breaks | Continuous effort, nasal breathing pace | Overall race endurance, pacing over 60–90 min |

**Galpin's Key Principle for Hyrox Athletes:** The closer two adaptations are to each other on the list, the more compatible they are for concurrent training. Speed, power, and strength (2–4) are very complementary. Muscular endurance, anaerobic capacity, and aerobic capacity (6–8) are also compatible. The challenge arises when trying to maximize adaptations at opposite ends of the spectrum simultaneously — for example, maximal hypertrophy (5) and long-duration endurance (9). This is the concurrent training problem, which Galpin addresses directly. (Source: *Huberman Lab*, Episode 4: "Optimize Your Training Program for Fitness & Longevity")

**Galpin's Programming Rules (The "3-to-5" Rule for Strength):**
- 3–5 exercises per session
- 3–5 reps per set
- 3–5 sets per exercise
- 3–5 times per week
- 3–5 minutes rest between sets

This formula is for pure strength development. For Hyrox, Galpin would recommend a blended approach across the week — some sessions targeting strength (3–5 rule), others targeting muscular endurance (high rep, short rest), and others targeting aerobic capacity (Zone 2 or interval training).

**Galpin's "Sugarcane" Protocol for Anaerobic Capacity**

One of the most practical tools Galpin shared on *Huberman Lab* (Episode 3: "How to Build Physical Endurance & Lose Fat") is the Sugarcane Protocol — a self-regulating interval workout designed to test and build anaerobic capacity:

- **Round 1:** Choose a cardio modality (bike, rower, ski erg). Go as hard as you can for a set distance or time (e.g., 500m row). Note the time.
- **Round 2:** Rest fully (2–4 minutes). Repeat the exact same distance. Try to match your Round 1 time. Note the time.
- **Round 3:** Rest fully. Now you must *beat* your average time of Rounds 1 and 2.
- **Progression:** Add rounds over weeks (3 → 4 → 5 → 6–8 rounds).

The beauty of this protocol is self-regulation: if you go out too fast in Round 1, Round 3 becomes brutally hard. If you pace too conservatively, Round 3 is easy — but your total output suffers. It teaches pacing discipline while building anaerobic capacity — exactly the dual demand of Hyrox.

**Galpin's Endurance Training Hierarchy:**

| Endurance Type | Work Duration | Fuel Source | HR Zone | RPE | Breathing |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Muscular Endurance | Repeated reps to local failure | Glycogen, PCr | Variable | 6–8/10 | Unrestricted |
| Anaerobic Capacity | 20–120 sec max effort | Glycogen (anaerobic glycolysis) | Zone 4–5 | 9–10/10 | Mouth, forced |
| Max Aerobic Capacity (VO2max) | 4–8 min intervals | Glycogen + Oxidative | Zone 4–5 | 8–9/10 | Mouth, labored |
| Long-Duration Endurance | 15–60+ min continuous | Fat (primary), Glycogen (secondary) | Zone 2 | 4–6/10 | Nasal only (ideally) |

## 2. Energy Systems for Hyrox

### 2.1 The Three Energy Systems: How They Interact During a 60–90 Minute Race

All three energy systems — phosphagen (ATP-PCr), glycolytic, and oxidative — operate simultaneously during any physical activity. What changes is their *relative contribution* based on intensity and duration. In Hyrox, the oxidative system is the dominant provider of ATP across the full race duration, but the glycolytic and phosphagen systems play crucial roles at specific stations and transitions.

**The Brandt et al. (2025) Study — First Peer-Reviewed Hyrox Research**

This landmark study (Brandt, Ebel, Lebahn, & Schmidt, 2025; *Frontiers in Physiology*, 16, doi: 10.3389/fphys.2025.1519240) provides the most rigorous physiological data on Hyrox to date. Key findings from 11 recreational Hyrox athletes completing a simulated competition:

| Metric | Full Hyrox | Running Segments | Exercise Stations |
|---|---|---|---|
| Completion Time (median) | 86.5 min | 51.2 min (59%) | 32.8 min (38%) |
| HR max (bpm) | 185 | 180 | 185 |
| HR avg (bpm) | 170.9 | 168.9 | 173.7 |
| Blood Lactate max (mmol/L) | 8.5 | 7.7 | 8.5 |
| RPE max (Borg 6–20) | 18 | 16 | 18 |
| Time at "Very Hard" intensity (% HRmax) | 79.5% of race | — | — |

**Key Takeaways for Coaching:**
- Hyrox is performed overwhelmingly at **hard to very hard intensity** (79.5% of total time above 80% HRmax).
- **VO2max was the strongest correlate of overall race time** (ρ = −0.71, p = 0.01), followed by endurance training volume (ρ = −0.68) and body fat percentage (ρ = 0.67).
- **Strength measures (hand grip strength, muscle mass) did NOT correlate with completion time.** Once athletes can handle the competition loads, further strength gains yield diminishing returns.
- The **exercise stations were more intense than the runs** by every metric (HR, lactate, RPE), but took less time.
- The **heaviest stations (sled push, sled pull) were completed fastest** — typically 2–3 minutes — placing them in the glycolytic/anaerobic capacity domain.
- **Wall balls produced the highest HR, lactate, and RPE** — occurring last in the race when cumulative fatigue is maximal.

### 2.2 Energy System Demands by Hyrox Station

| Station | Primary Energy System | Duration (typical) | Key Demand | Training Implication |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 km Run (×8) | Oxidative (primary), Glycolytic (secondary) | 4–7 min each | Sustained aerobic output, lactate clearance between stations | Zone 2 base, threshold running, fatigued-state running |
| Ski Erg (1000m) | Oxidative + Glycolytic | 3–5 min | Upper body aerobic endurance, sustained power | Aerobic intervals on ski erg, muscular endurance |
| Sled Push (4×12.5m) | Phosphagen + Glycolytic | 2–3 min | Maximal force production, rapid depletion | Strength-endurance, heavy sled practice, power endurance |
| Sled Pull (4×12.5m) | Phosphagen + Glycolytic | 2–3 min | Grip + posterior chain under heavy load | Grip endurance, rowing/pulling strength-endurance |
| Burpee Broad Jump (80m) | Glycolytic + Oxidative | 3–5 min | Repeated explosive effort, global fatigue | Plyometric endurance, pacing short explosive reps |
| Row Erg (1000m) | Oxidative + Glycolytic | 3–5 min | Full-body aerobic power, pacing | Aerobic intervals on rower, threshold pacing |
| Farmers Carry (200m) | Oxidative (low intensity per step) | 2–3 min | Grip endurance, loaded locomotion | Loaded carries, grip training, trunk stability |
| Sandbag Lunges (100m) | Glycolytic + Oxidative | 3–5 min | Muscular endurance (quads, glutes), balance | High-rep lunging, leg endurance, unilateral strength |
| Wall Balls (75–100 reps) | Glycolytic (dominant by end) | 3–6 min | Muscular endurance (quads, shoulders), lactate tolerance | High-rep wall balls, EMOM sets, active recovery between sets |

### 2.3 How to Train Each Energy System for Hyrox

| Energy System | Training Protocol | Work:Rest Ratio | Sets × Duration | Intensity | Frequency/Week |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Phosphagen (ATP-PCr) | Heavy sled pushes, max sprints | 1:12–1:20 | 6–10 × 5–10 sec | 95–100% max effort | 1–2× (in strength sessions) |
| Glycolytic (Fast) | Sled push/pull repeats, ski erg intervals | 1:3–1:5 | 4–8 × 30–90 sec | 85–95% max effort | 1–2× |
| Glycolytic (Slow) | Wall ball EMOMs, sandbag lunge sets, threshold intervals | 1:1–1:2 | 3–6 × 2–5 min | 75–85% max effort | 2–3× |
| Oxidative (VO2max) | Norwegian 4×4, Hinshaw-style intervals | 1:0.75 | 4 × 4 min | 85–95% HRmax | 1–2× |
| Oxidative (Base/Zone 2) | Easy run, bike, row, hike | Continuous | 1 × 30–90 min | 60–70% HRmax, nasal breathing | 2–4× |

## 3. Aerobic Base Development

### 3.1 Zone 2 Training: What It Is, Why It Matters, How Much Is Enough

Zone 2 training refers to exercise performed at or just below the first lactate threshold (LT1), typically defined as the intensity at which blood lactate first rises above resting levels (~2 mmol/L). At this intensity, the body predominantly uses fat as fuel, the effort is sustainable for long durations, and the athlete can breathe through the nose or hold a conversation. (Source: Iñigo San-Millán, PhD; CTS/TrainRight, 2025)

**Physiological Adaptations of Zone 2 Training:**

| Adaptation | Mechanism | Why It Matters for Hyrox |
|---|---|---|
| Increased mitochondrial density | Biogenesis of mitochondria in slow-twitch fibers | More energy production capacity per muscle cell |
| Enhanced fat oxidation | Upregulation of fatty acid transport and beta-oxidation enzymes | Preserves glycogen for high-intensity stations |
| Improved lactate clearance | Increased MCT1 transporters, slow-twitch fiber lactate shuttling | Faster recovery between stations and runs |
| Increased capillarization | Growth of new capillary beds around muscle fibers | Better oxygen delivery and waste removal |
| Greater stroke volume | Heart adapts to pump more blood per beat | Lower heart rate at any given submaximal pace |
| Increased plasma volume | Expansion of blood volume | Better thermoregulation, improved cardiac output |

**Zone 2 Intensity Guidelines:**

| Method | Zone 2 Range | Practical Cue |
|---|---|---|
| % of Max Heart Rate | 60–70% HRmax | Can hold a conversation, slight breathlessness |
| % of Lactate Threshold HR | 68–83% of LT2 HR | Comfortably challenging, not hard |
| RPE (1–10) | 3–5/10 | "I could do this for a long time" |
| Blood Lactate | 1.5–2.5 mmol/L | Below first lactate threshold |
| Talk Test | Can speak in full sentences | Lose the ability = too hard |
| Breathing | Nasal breathing achievable | If you must mouth-breathe, slow down |

(Sources: San-Millán & Brooks, 2018; CTS/TrainRight "Blood Lactate in Training" article; Galpin, *Huberman Lab* Episode 3)

**How Much Zone 2 Is Enough?**

The polarized training model used by elite endurance athletes suggests approximately 80% of total training volume should be in Zone 1–2, with the remaining 20% at high intensity (Zone 4–5). For a Hyrox athlete training 6–10 hours per week:

| Weekly Training Volume | Zone 2 Target | Zone 2 Sessions | Format |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6 hours/week | 3–4 hours | 2–3 sessions of 60–90 min | Easy runs, bike rides, row, hike |
| 8 hours/week | 4–5 hours | 3–4 sessions of 60–80 min | Mixed modality (run, bike, row) |
| 10 hours/week | 6–7 hours | 4–5 sessions of 60–90 min | Primarily running + cross-training |

Galpin's recommendation for long-duration endurance: perform 15+ minutes of continuous work at a pace where you can maintain nasal breathing. For most Hyrox athletes, this is a run, bike, or row at an easy, conversational effort. Two sessions per week is the minimum effective dose; three to four is optimal for building a robust aerobic base while leaving room for high-intensity and strength work. (Source: *Huberman Lab*, Episode 3)

### 3.2 The MAF (Maximum Aerobic Function) Method

The MAF method, developed by Dr. Phil Maffetone, uses a simple formula to estimate Zone 2 heart rate: **180 − age = MAF HR ceiling**. This is then adjusted by fitness status (e.g., +5 for consistent athletes, −5 for recovering from injury/illness).

| Age | MAF HR (Base) | Adjusted (Fit Athlete) | Adjusted (Returning from Injury) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 25 | 155 bpm | 160 bpm | 150 bpm |
| 30 | 150 bpm | 155 bpm | 145 bpm |
| 35 | 145 bpm | 150 bpm | 140 bpm |
| 40 | 140 bpm | 145 bpm | 135 bpm |

**Hyrox Application:** The MAF method is useful as a *starting point* for Hyrox athletes who don't have access to lactate testing. However, it is less accurate than lactate-based zone setting, and athletes with high fitness levels may find it overly conservative. Use MAF as a floor — if your easy runs feel "too slow" at MAF heart rate, that's actually the point. Trust the process. Over 8–12 weeks, MAF pace will improve (same heart rate, faster pace), which is direct evidence of aerobic base improvement.

### 3.3 Lactate Threshold Training for Hyrox Pacing

The lactate threshold (LT2) represents the intensity above which lactate accumulates faster than the body can clear it. For Hyrox, the goal is to push LT2 as high as possible so that race pace (which is predominantly aerobic) represents a smaller fraction of maximal capacity.

**Lactate Threshold Interval Protocols:**

| Protocol | Work Interval | Rest | Sets | Intensity | Target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tempo Runs | 20–40 min continuous | N/A | 1 | ~85–88% HRmax, "comfortably hard" | LT2 improvement |
| Cruise Intervals | 3 × 10–15 min | 2–3 min jog | 3 | At or slightly below LT2 | Sustained threshold capacity |
| Threshold Repeats | 4 × 8 min | 2–3 min | 4 | At LT2 pace | Lactate tolerance and clearance |
| Progressive Run | 30–45 min, last 10–15 min at threshold | N/A | 1 | Build from Zone 2 → LT2 | Pacing discipline, metabolic transition |

(Sources: Kristensen et al., as cited in *PMC* zone 2/3 interval review, 2023; Helgerud et al., 2007)

**Hyrox-Specific Application:** A Hyrox race is best paced at or just below lactate threshold for the running segments. The stations will push blood lactate above threshold. The runs must therefore be paced conservatively enough to allow partial lactate clearance. Training at threshold teaches the body where that "redline" is and expands it over time. A weekly schedule might include one tempo or threshold session and one true Zone 2 session as the endurance components alongside interval and strength work.

### 4.1 Interval Protocol Comparison Table

| Protocol | Work Duration | Rest Duration | Intensity | Sets/Reps | Primary Adaptation | Key Study |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Norwegian 4×4** | 4 min | 3 min active recovery | 85–95% HRmax | 4 intervals | VO2max (+11–13% in 8 weeks) | Helgerud et al., 2007 |
| **Tabata** | 20 sec | 10 sec | All-out (170% VO2max) | 8 rounds (4 min total) | Anaerobic capacity, VO2max | Tabata et al., 1996 |

| **Galpin Sugarcane** | Variable (set distance) | 2–4 min full recovery | Self-regulated (escalating) | 3–8 rounds | Anaerobic capacity, pacing | Galpin (practitioner) |

### 4.2 The Norwegian 4×4 Protocol — Gold Standard for VO2max

The Norwegian 4×4 is arguably the most well-validated interval protocol for improving VO2max. Developed by researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the protocol is:

- **Warm-up:** 10 minutes at easy pace
- **Work:** 4 × 4 minutes at 85–95% of HRmax
- **Recovery:** 3 minutes of active recovery (walking or easy jogging) between intervals
- **Cool-down:** 5–10 minutes easy

**Evidence:** Helgerud et al. (2007, *Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise*) demonstrated a 13% increase in VO2max in just 8 weeks with this protocol, compared to only 3.2% with steady-state training of equivalent total work. Wisløff et al. (2007) showed that 4×4 intervals improved cardiac function and reversed heart damage in heart failure patients. A study of untrained 50-year-olds showed that performing the Norwegian 4×4 just once per week for two years made their hearts functionally 20 years younger.

**Why This Matters for Hyrox:** VO2max was the strongest single predictor of Hyrox race performance (Brandt et al., 2025). The 4-minute work intervals fall right in the 6–9 minute "VO2max time domain" that Hinshaw identifies as the sweet spot for improving the ability to bring in and utilize oxygen. One to two sessions per week of Norwegian 4×4 intervals on the rower, bike, ski erg, or running track should be a staple for any Hyrox athlete in their general preparation phase.

### 4.3 How to Periodize Intervals Leading into a Hyrox Race

| Weeks Out from Race | Phase | Interval Focus | Example Session | Frequency |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 16–12 | Base Building | Zone 2 + short introduction to intervals | 1 × Norwegian 4×4 per week + 2–3 Zone 2 sessions | 1 interval + 2–3 Zone 2 |
| 12–8 | Aerobic Development | VO2max intervals + threshold work | Norwegian 4×4 (1×/wk) + threshold repeats (1×/wk) + Zone 2 (2×/wk) | 2 intervals + 2 Zone 2 |
| 8–4 | Race-Specific | Hyrox simulation intervals, station-to-run transitions | Race-pace station work + 1 km runs (1×/wk) + 30/30 intervals (1×/wk) + Zone 2 (1–2×/wk) | 2 intervals + 1–2 Zone 2 |
| 4–2 | Sharpening | Reduce volume, maintain intensity | Short sharp intervals (Tabata or 30/30) 1×/wk + 1 easy run + 1 race-pace session | 1–2 sessions, reduced volume |
| 2–0 | Taper | Reduce volume 40–60%, maintain intensity | 1 short interval session + 1 easy run + rest | Minimal, quality over quantity |

## 5. Concurrent Training Research

### 5.1 The Interference Effect: What the Science Actually Says

The "interference effect" was first documented by Hickson (1980), who showed that untrained men doing both strength and endurance training simultaneously had reduced strength gains compared to those doing strength training alone. This spawned decades of concern that "cardio kills gains."

**The Molecular Mechanism (Simplified):**

- **Resistance training** activates the **mTOR pathway** (Mammalian Target of Rapamycin), which drives muscle protein synthesis — the process of building new muscle tissue.
- **Endurance training** activates the **AMPK pathway** (AMP-activated protein kinase), which restores cellular energy balance by upregulating catabolic processes and inhibiting anabolic processes, including mTOR.
- These two pathways were once thought to act as a molecular "switch" — you're either building muscle (mTOR) or generating energy (AMPK), but not both simultaneously.

**What Modern Research Shows:**

Three major meta-analyses have now concluded that **concurrent training does not significantly compromise strength or hypertrophy gains** compared to resistance-training-only programs, provided total training load is managed appropri

============================================================

YOUR RESEARCH TASK:

You are a training program designer building a 16-week Hyrox preparation plan.
You have access to research from other teams (which will be provided as context).

### Athlete Profile
- Male
- Currently runs 35–40 miles per week
- Currently does 4–5 strength training sessions per week
- Goal: transition 2–3 strength sessions to HIIT/hybrid Hyrox-specific work
- Target race: Hyrox on June 6, 2025
- Training start: ~mid-February 2025

### Your Task

1. **Periodization Model**
   - Design a macro-level periodization structure for 16 weeks
   - Phase breakdown: General Prep → Specific Prep → Competition → Taper
   - What changes week to week in terms of volume, intensity, specificity
   - How running volume evolves across the 16 weeks
   - How strength/HIIT balance shifts

2. **Weekly Templates (one per phase)**
   - For each phase, create a sample weekly template showing:
     - Day-by-day schedule
     - Session type (run, HIIT, strength, Hyrox simulation, recovery)
     - Estimated duration
     - Key focus/intent of each session
   - Must preserve 35-40 mpw running base
   - Must include 2-3 Hyrox-specific HIIT sessions
   - Must retain 1-2 pure strength sessions

3. **HIIT Session Library**
   - Design 15-20 different HIIT workouts using formats like:
     - EMOM (Every Minute on the Minute)
     - AMRAP (As Many Rounds/Reps As Possible)
     - For Time
     - Interval formats (work:rest ratios)
     - Tabata
     - Chipper-style
   - Each workout should target specific Hyrox stations or energy systems
   - Include scaling options and target times/scores

4. **Hyrox Simulation Workouts**
   - Design 4-6 full or partial Hyrox simulation workouts
   - When in the 16-week plan to deploy them
   - How to use them as both training AND benchmarking tools

5. **Progressive Overload Strategy**
   - How to progress running (speed work, tempo, intervals)
   - How to progress station-specific work (heavier sleds, more reps, etc.)
   - How to progress HIIT complexity and density
   - Deload week structure and frequency

6. **Taper Protocol**
   - Final 10-14 day taper strategy
   - What to cut, what to maintain
   - Race week schedule
   - Race day warm-up protocol

7. **Testing & Checkpoint Schedule**
   - When to test what (time trials, station benchmarks, simulations)
   - Key metrics to track weekly
   - Decision points: "if X, then adjust Y"

IMPORTANT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Length: This must be the LONGEST document — at minimum 5,000-8,000 words. This is the core programming engine for the AI coach. Do not summarize anything.
- Format: Use structured markdown with H2/H3 headers and EXTENSIVE use of markdown tables.
- Weekly templates MUST be in table format: Day | Session Type | Duration | Key Focus | Example Workout
- Every workout must be fully prescribed: movements, sets x reps @ intensity (RPE or %1RM), rest periods, time caps.
- HIIT session library: Each of the 15-20 workouts needs complete prescriptions, not just descriptions.
- Decision trees for autoregulation: "If athlete reports RPE > 8 on Tuesday intervals, then reduce Thursday volume by X%"
- Be extremely specific and actionable — an AI coach will use this to generate real training plans for real athletes.
