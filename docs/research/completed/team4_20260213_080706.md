## 1. Key Figures and Their Frameworks

### 1.1 Chris Hinshaw — Aerobic Capacity and the Endurance Engine

Chris Hinshaw is the founder of the Aerobic Capacity programming system and has coached over 35 CrossFit Games champions. A former Ironman triathlete himself, Hinshaw transitioned into coaching functional fitness athletes after observing a critical gap: most high-intensity training programs neglected the aerobic system entirely, relying almost exclusively on glycolytic and phosphagen energy systems. Hinshaw's central thesis — which he calls "building the engine" — is that an athlete's aerobic base is the mechanical foundation that allows all other physical capacities to express themselves at higher volumes and for longer durations.

**Core Philosophy: The Aerobic Engine**

Hinshaw's philosophy rests on several key principles drawn from his coaching experience and endurance sport background (Source: *PMPC Podcast #004, Chris Hinshaw – Aerobic Capacity Founder*, 2024; *Best Hour of Their Day* episodes 561-562; *Jedburgh Podcast*):

1. **Fast-twitch fibers create fatigue; slow-twitch fibers clear it.** During high-intensity work, fast-twitch muscle fibers produce lactate and other fatigue-inducing byproducts. Slow-twitch fibers consume that lactate as fuel. If an athlete only trains high intensity, they become excellent at *producing* lactate and working under its burden, but they never develop the capacity to *clear* it. This is the bottleneck — and the aerobic engine is the solution.

2. **If you have a 50/50 blend of fast-twitch and slow-twitch fibers and only train fast-twitch, you are leaving 50% of your available capacity passive.** Slow-twitch fibers require volume and time under tension to adapt. Short, explosive training sessions do not provide the overload stimulus these fibers need. This is especially critical for Hyrox, where the race lasts 60–90+ minutes and demands sustained output across diverse movement patterns.

3. **Every movement is unique, and every intensity within that movement is unique.** Hinshaw insists that athletes train across a "variety of intensities." Speed alone does not develop the full spectrum of the aerobic system. You must train the low end (base building, lactate clearance, capillarization), the moderate range (tempo and threshold work), and the high end (VO2max intervals) to build a complete engine.

4. **Pacing is the ultimate competitive advantage.** Hinshaw was one of the earliest advocates of pacing strategy in functional fitness. He teaches that efficiently and effectively consuming available energy through controlled pacing maximizes total performance. In Hyrox, where athletes must sustain effort across 8 km of running interspersed with 8 functional stations, pacing is not optional — it is the difference between a competitive finish and a collapse.

5. **Long-term cellular adaptation beats short-term intensity spikes.** While high-intensity protocols produce quick results, Hinshaw warns that these adaptations are "non-sustainable" and "riddled with risk." The real gains come from cellular-level adaptation: increased mitochondrial density, capillarization, improved fat oxidation, and enhanced stroke volume. These take months to develop but last far longer and provide a far higher ceiling.

**Hinshaw's Interval Prescriptions**

Hinshaw structures interval workouts around three key variables: **distance (or time), intensity, and rest**. He designs workouts with very specific intent — targeting either the aerobic system (VO2max zone, typically 6–9 minutes at maximum effort), the lactate clearance system (moderate work with active recovery), or the pacing system (controlled-split intervals). (Source: *Jedburgh Podcast*; *brUTE Strength Podcast Ep.10*)

| Protocol Type | Example Workout | Work Interval | Rest Interval | Intensity | Target Adaptation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| VO2max Intervals | 3 sets × 4 × 400m run | ~2 min per rep | 40 sec between reps, 4 min between sets | Moderate to hard pace | Aerobic capacity, oxygen utilization |
| Multi-Modal Transfer | 4 × 2 min on each of bike, row, ski (12 rounds total) | 2 min per effort | Matched to running rest periods | Sport-specific moderate pace | Cross-modal aerobic transfer, RPM matching |
| Pacing Intervals | 5 × 1 km run (even-split target) | ~4–6 min each | 2–3 min walk/jog | Controlled, aiming for identical splits | Pacing discipline, metabolic efficiency |
| Active Recovery Focus | Wall balls: 20 reps + 5 slow air squats EMOM | ~45 sec work per min | Remaining time in minute (active) | Race-weight ball, race-pace reps | Lactate clearance under continued movement |
| Aerobic Base Run | 30–60 min at conversational pace | Continuous | N/A | Zone 2 (nasal breathing capable) | Capillarization, fat oxidation, slow-twitch development |

**Hinshaw's Active Recovery Principle for Hyrox:** Rather than lying on the floor between heavy sets, Hinshaw advocates keeping the body moving at low intensity — cycling slowly, doing air squats, or walking — to encourage the slow-twitch fibers to consume the lactate produced by the fast-twitch fibers. This is directly applicable to Hyrox station-to-run transitions, where the ability to recover *while still moving* is paramount. A Hyrox-adapted version: after sled pushes, immediately transition to a slow jog for the subsequent 1 km run rather than standing still, even if the first 200m feels slow. The physiological payoff is faster lactate clearance and a lower perceived effort for the remainder of the run. (Source: YouTube, "Use Hinshaw's method to increase your reps for Hyrox," 2023)

**Hyrox Relevance:** Hinshaw's framework maps almost perfectly onto the Hyrox demand profile. A Hyrox race is an 8 km run broken into 1 km segments, interspersed with 8 functional stations. More than 60% of total race time is spent running (Brandt et al., 2025, *Frontiers in Physiology*). The ability to clear lactate during running segments after high-output stations (sled push, sled pull, wall balls) is the single most trainable limiter for most recreational Hyrox athletes.

### 1.2 Andy Galpin, PhD — Exercise Physiology and the 9 Adaptations Framework

Andy Galpin is a Professor of Kinesiology at California State University, Fullerton, and one of the foremost authorities on bridging exercise science and practical application. His six-part guest series on the *Huberman Lab Podcast* (January–February 2023) constituted a landmark body of content on fitness science, covering everything from assessment to programming to recovery. His frameworks provide the scientific scaffolding upon which an AI Hyrox coach should build all training recommendations.

**The 9 Exercise-Induced Adaptations**

Galpin categorizes the physiological outcomes of exercise into 9 distinct adaptations. Each is elicited by manipulating modifiable training variables: exercise choice, intensity, volume, rest intervals, and progressive overload. The 9 adaptations are (Source: *Huberman Lab Guest Series*, Episode 1: "How to Assess & Improve All Aspects of Your Fitness"):

| # | Adaptation | Definition | Key Training Variable | Hyrox Relevance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Skill/Technique | Moving more efficiently in specific patterns | Exercise choice, practice | Running economy, wall ball technique, sled mechanics |
| 2 | Speed | Higher velocity or rate of acceleration | Low volume, max effort, full rest | Burpee broad jump explosiveness, sled push initiation |
| 3 | Power | Speed × Force | Explosive movements, moderate load | Sled push/pull drive, wall ball power |
| 4 | Strength (Force) | Maximum force production in one effort | 3–5 reps, 3–5 sets, 3–5 min rest | Sled push/pull capacity, farmers carry load management |
| 5 | Hypertrophy | Muscle size increase | 6–30 reps, 10–20 sets/muscle/week | Functional muscle mass for load-bearing stations |
| 6 | Muscular Endurance | Reps to failure in a localized muscle group | High reps, short rest, local fatigue | Wall balls (75–100 reps), sandbag lunges |
| 7 | Anaerobic Capacity | Max work at max effort, total system fatigue | 20–120 sec all-out, full recovery | Sled push/pull, ski erg, rowing erg bursts |
| 8 | Maximal Aerobic Capacity (VO2max) | Max oxygen utilization, 8–15 min domain | Intervals at 85–95% HRmax, 3–5 min work | 1 km run splits, sustained high output across race |
| 9 | Long-Duration Endurance | Sustained sub-maximal work, 15+ min, no breaks | Continuous effort, nasal breathing pace | Overall race endurance, pacing over 60–90 min |

**Galpin's Key Principle for Hyrox Athletes:** The closer two adaptations are to each other on the list, the more compatible they are for concurrent training. Speed, power, and strength (2–4) are very complementary. Muscular endurance, anaerobic capacity, and aerobic capacity (6–8) are also compatible. The challenge arises when trying to maximize adaptations at opposite ends of the spectrum simultaneously — for example, maximal hypertrophy (5) and long-duration endurance (9). This is the concurrent training problem, which Galpin addresses directly. (Source: *Huberman Lab*, Episode 4: "Optimize Your Training Program for Fitness & Longevity")

**Galpin's Programming Rules (The "3-to-5" Rule for Strength):**
- 3–5 exercises per session
- 3–5 reps per set
- 3–5 sets per exercise
- 3–5 times per week
- 3–5 minutes rest between sets

This formula is for pure strength development. For Hyrox, Galpin would recommend a blended approach across the week — some sessions targeting strength (3–5 rule), others targeting muscular endurance (high rep, short rest), and others targeting aerobic capacity (Zone 2 or interval training).

**Galpin's "Sugarcane" Protocol for Anaerobic Capacity**

One of the most practical tools Galpin shared on *Huberman Lab* (Episode 3: "How to Build Physical Endurance & Lose Fat") is the Sugarcane Protocol — a self-regulating interval workout designed to test and build anaerobic capacity:

- **Round 1:** Choose a cardio modality (bike, rower, ski erg). Go as hard as you can for a set distance or time (e.g., 500m row). Note the time.
- **Round 2:** Rest fully (2–4 minutes). Repeat the exact same distance. Try to match your Round 1 time. Note the time.
- **Round 3:** Rest fully. Now you must *beat* your average time of Rounds 1 and 2.
- **Progression:** Add rounds over weeks (3 → 4 → 5 → 6–8 rounds).

The beauty of this protocol is self-regulation: if you go out too fast in Round 1, Round 3 becomes brutally hard. If you pace too conservatively, Round 3 is easy — but your total output suffers. It teaches pacing discipline while building anaerobic capacity — exactly the dual demand of Hyrox.

**Galpin's Endurance Training Hierarchy:**

| Endurance Type | Work Duration | Fuel Source | HR Zone | RPE | Breathing |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Muscular Endurance | Repeated reps to local failure | Glycogen, PCr | Variable | 6–8/10 | Unrestricted |
| Anaerobic Capacity | 20–120 sec max effort | Glycogen (anaerobic glycolysis) | Zone 4–5 | 9–10/10 | Mouth, forced |
| Max Aerobic Capacity (VO2max) | 4–8 min intervals | Glycogen + Oxidative | Zone 4–5 | 8–9/10 | Mouth, labored |
| Long-Duration Endurance | 15–60+ min continuous | Fat (primary), Glycogen (secondary) | Zone 2 | 4–6/10 | Nasal only (ideally) |

## 2. Energy Systems for Hyrox

### 2.1 The Three Energy Systems: How They Interact During a 60–90 Minute Race

All three energy systems — phosphagen (ATP-PCr), glycolytic, and oxidative — operate simultaneously during any physical activity. What changes is their *relative contribution* based on intensity and duration. In Hyrox, the oxidative system is the dominant provider of ATP across the full race duration, but the glycolytic and phosphagen systems play crucial roles at specific stations and transitions.

**The Brandt et al. (2025) Study — First Peer-Reviewed Hyrox Research**

This landmark study (Brandt, Ebel, Lebahn, & Schmidt, 2025; *Frontiers in Physiology*, 16, doi: 10.3389/fphys.2025.1519240) provides the most rigorous physiological data on Hyrox to date. Key findings from 11 recreational Hyrox athletes completing a simulated competition:

| Metric | Full Hyrox | Running Segments | Exercise Stations |
|---|---|---|---|
| Completion Time (median) | 86.5 min | 51.2 min (59%) | 32.8 min (38%) |
| HR max (bpm) | 185 | 180 | 185 |
| HR avg (bpm) | 170.9 | 168.9 | 173.7 |
| Blood Lactate max (mmol/L) | 8.5 | 7.7 | 8.5 |
| RPE max (Borg 6–20) | 18 | 16 | 18 |
| Time at "Very Hard" intensity (% HRmax) | 79.5% of race | — | — |

**Key Takeaways for Coaching:**
- Hyrox is performed overwhelmingly at **hard to very hard intensity** (79.5% of total time above 80% HRmax).
- **VO2max was the strongest correlate of overall race time** (ρ = −0.71, p = 0.01), followed by endurance training volume (ρ = −0.68) and body fat percentage (ρ = 0.67).
- **Strength measures (hand grip strength, muscle mass) did NOT correlate with completion time.** Once athletes can handle the competition loads, further strength gains yield diminishing returns.
- The **exercise stations were more intense than the runs** by every metric (HR, lactate, RPE), but took less time.
- The **heaviest stations (sled push, sled pull) were completed fastest** — typically 2–3 minutes — placing them in the glycolytic/anaerobic capacity domain.
- **Wall balls produced the highest HR, lactate, and RPE** — occurring last in the race when cumulative fatigue is maximal.

### 2.2 Energy System Demands by Hyrox Station

| Station | Primary Energy System | Duration (typical) | Key Demand | Training Implication |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 km Run (×8) | Oxidative (primary), Glycolytic (secondary) | 4–7 min each | Sustained aerobic output, lactate clearance between stations | Zone 2 base, threshold running, fatigued-state running |
| Ski Erg (1000m) | Oxidative + Glycolytic | 3–5 min | Upper body aerobic endurance, sustained power | Aerobic intervals on ski erg, muscular endurance |
| Sled Push (4×12.5m) | Phosphagen + Glycolytic | 2–3 min | Maximal force production, rapid depletion | Strength-endurance, heavy sled practice, power endurance |
| Sled Pull (4×12.5m) | Phosphagen + Glycolytic | 2–3 min | Grip + posterior chain under heavy load | Grip endurance, rowing/pulling strength-endurance |
| Burpee Broad Jump (80m) | Glycolytic + Oxidative | 3–5 min | Repeated explosive effort, global fatigue | Plyometric endurance, pacing short explosive reps |
| Row Erg (1000m) | Oxidative + Glycolytic | 3–5 min | Full-body aerobic power, pacing | Aerobic intervals on rower, threshold pacing |
| Farmers Carry (200m) | Oxidative (low intensity per step) | 2–3 min | Grip endurance, loaded locomotion | Loaded carries, grip training, trunk stability |
| Sandbag Lunges (100m) | Glycolytic + Oxidative | 3–5 min | Muscular endurance (quads, glutes), balance | High-rep lunging, leg endurance, unilateral strength |
| Wall Balls (75–100 reps) | Glycolytic (dominant by end) | 3–6 min | Muscular endurance (quads, shoulders), lactate tolerance | High-rep wall balls, EMOM sets, active recovery between sets |

### 2.3 How to Train Each Energy System for Hyrox

| Energy System | Training Protocol | Work:Rest Ratio | Sets × Duration | Intensity | Frequency/Week |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Phosphagen (ATP-PCr) | Heavy sled pushes, max sprints | 1:12–1:20 | 6–10 × 5–10 sec | 95–100% max effort | 1–2× (in strength sessions) |
| Glycolytic (Fast) | Sled push/pull repeats, ski erg intervals | 1:3–1:5 | 4–8 × 30–90 sec | 85–95% max effort | 1–2× |
| Glycolytic (Slow) | Wall ball EMOMs, sandbag lunge sets, threshold intervals | 1:1–1:2 | 3–6 × 2–5 min | 75–85% max effort | 2–3× |
| Oxidative (VO2max) | Norwegian 4×4, Hinshaw-style intervals | 1:0.75 | 4 × 4 min | 85–95% HRmax | 1–2× |
| Oxidative (Base/Zone 2) | Easy run, bike, row, hike | Continuous | 1 × 30–90 min | 60–70% HRmax, nasal breathing | 2–4× |

## 3. Aerobic Base Development

### 3.1 Zone 2 Training: What It Is, Why It Matters, How Much Is Enough

Zone 2 training refers to exercise performed at or just below the first lactate threshold (LT1), typically defined as the intensity at which blood lactate first rises above resting levels (~2 mmol/L). At this intensity, the body predominantly uses fat as fuel, the effort is sustainable for long durations, and the athlete can breathe through the nose or hold a conversation. (Source: Iñigo San-Millán, PhD; CTS/TrainRight, 2025)

**Physiological Adaptations of Zone 2 Training:**

| Adaptation | Mechanism | Why It Matters for Hyrox |
|---|---|---|
| Increased mitochondrial density | Biogenesis of mitochondria in slow-twitch fibers | More energy production capacity per muscle cell |
| Enhanced fat oxidation | Upregulation of fatty acid transport and beta-oxidation enzymes | Preserves glycogen for high-intensity stations |
| Improved lactate clearance | Increased MCT1 transporters, slow-twitch fiber lactate shuttling | Faster recovery between stations and runs |
| Increased capillarization | Growth of new capillary beds around muscle fibers | Better oxygen delivery and waste removal |
| Greater stroke volume | Heart adapts to pump more blood per beat | Lower heart rate at any given submaximal pace |
| Increased plasma volume | Expansion of blood volume | Better thermoregulation, improved cardiac output |

**Zone 2 Intensity Guidelines:**

| Method | Zone 2 Range | Practical Cue |
|---|---|---|
| % of Max Heart Rate | 60–70% HRmax | Can hold a conversation, slight breathlessness |
| % of Lactate Threshold HR | 68–83% of LT2 HR | Comfortably challenging, not hard |
| RPE (1–10) | 3–5/10 | "I could do this for a long time" |
| Blood Lactate | 1.5–2.5 mmol/L | Below first lactate threshold |
| Talk Test | Can speak in full sentences | Lose the ability = too hard |
| Breathing | Nasal breathing achievable | If you must mouth-breathe, slow down |

(Sources: San-Millán & Brooks, 2018; CTS/TrainRight "Blood Lactate in Training" article; Galpin, *Huberman Lab* Episode 3)

**How Much Zone 2 Is Enough?**

The polarized training model used by elite endurance athletes suggests approximately 80% of total training volume should be in Zone 1–2, with the remaining 20% at high intensity (Zone 4–5). For a Hyrox athlete training 6–10 hours per week:

| Weekly Training Volume | Zone 2 Target | Zone 2 Sessions | Format |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6 hours/week | 3–4 hours | 2–3 sessions of 60–90 min | Easy runs, bike rides, row, hike |
| 8 hours/week | 4–5 hours | 3–4 sessions of 60–80 min | Mixed modality (run, bike, row) |
| 10 hours/week | 6–7 hours | 4–5 sessions of 60–90 min | Primarily running + cross-training |

Galpin's recommendation for long-duration endurance: perform 15+ minutes of continuous work at a pace where you can maintain nasal breathing. For most Hyrox athletes, this is a run, bike, or row at an easy, conversational effort. Two sessions per week is the minimum effective dose; three to four is optimal for building a robust aerobic base while leaving room for high-intensity and strength work. (Source: *Huberman Lab*, Episode 3)

### 3.2 The MAF (Maximum Aerobic Function) Method

The MAF method, developed by Dr. Phil Maffetone, uses a simple formula to estimate Zone 2 heart rate: **180 − age = MAF HR ceiling**. This is then adjusted by fitness status (e.g., +5 for consistent athletes, −5 for recovering from injury/illness).

| Age | MAF HR (Base) | Adjusted (Fit Athlete) | Adjusted (Returning from Injury) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 25 | 155 bpm | 160 bpm | 150 bpm |
| 30 | 150 bpm | 155 bpm | 145 bpm |
| 35 | 145 bpm | 150 bpm | 140 bpm |
| 40 | 140 bpm | 145 bpm | 135 bpm |

**Hyrox Application:** The MAF method is useful as a *starting point* for Hyrox athletes who don't have access to lactate testing. However, it is less accurate than lactate-based zone setting, and athletes with high fitness levels may find it overly conservative. Use MAF as a floor — if your easy runs feel "too slow" at MAF heart rate, that's actually the point. Trust the process. Over 8–12 weeks, MAF pace will improve (same heart rate, faster pace), which is direct evidence of aerobic base improvement.

### 3.3 Lactate Threshold Training for Hyrox Pacing

The lactate threshold (LT2) represents the intensity above which lactate accumulates faster than the body can clear it. For Hyrox, the goal is to push LT2 as high as possible so that race pace (which is predominantly aerobic) represents a smaller fraction of maximal capacity.

**Lactate Threshold Interval Protocols:**

| Protocol | Work Interval | Rest | Sets | Intensity | Target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tempo Runs | 20–40 min continuous | N/A | 1 | ~85–88% HRmax, "comfortably hard" | LT2 improvement |
| Cruise Intervals | 3 × 10–15 min | 2–3 min jog | 3 | At or slightly below LT2 | Sustained threshold capacity |
| Threshold Repeats | 4 × 8 min | 2–3 min | 4 | At LT2 pace | Lactate tolerance and clearance |
| Progressive Run | 30–45 min, last 10–15 min at threshold | N/A | 1 | Build from Zone 2 → LT2 | Pacing discipline, metabolic transition |

(Sources: Kristensen et al., as cited in *PMC* zone 2/3 interval review, 2023; Helgerud et al., 2007)

**Hyrox-Specific Application:** A Hyrox race is best paced at or just below lactate threshold for the running segments. The stations will push blood lactate above threshold. The runs must therefore be paced conservatively enough to allow partial lactate clearance. Training at threshold teaches the body where that "redline" is and expands it over time. A weekly schedule might include one tempo or threshold session and one true Zone 2 session as the endurance components alongside interval and strength work.

## 4. Interval Training Science

### 4.1 Interval Protocol Comparison Table

| Protocol | Work Duration | Rest Duration | Intensity | Sets/Reps | Primary Adaptation | Key Study |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Norwegian 4×4** | 4 min | 3 min active recovery | 85–95% HRmax | 4 intervals | VO2max (+11–13% in 8 weeks) | Helgerud et al., 2007 |
| **Tabata** | 20 sec | 10 sec | All-out (170% VO2max) | 8 rounds (4 min total) | Anaerobic capacity, VO2max | Tabata et al., 1996 |
| **30/30 Intervals** | 30 sec | 30 sec active | 90–100% vVO2max | 12–20 rounds | Time at VO2max, buffering | Billat et al., 2001 |
| **Long Intervals** | 3–5 min | 2–4 min | 90–95% HRmax | 4–6 sets | VO2max, cardiac output | Seiler & Sjursen, 2004 |
| **Short Intervals** | 10–30 sec | 20–60 sec | Maximal sprint | 6–10 sets | Phosphagen repletion, speed | Ross & Leveritt, 2001 |
| **Threshold Repeats** | 8–15 min | 2–3 min | LT2 pace | 3–4 sets | Lactate threshold elevation | — |
| **Hinshaw Multi-Modal** | 2 min per modality | 40 sec between reps, 4 min between sets | Moderate–hard | 3 sets × 4 reps | Cross-modal aerobic transfer | Hinshaw (practitioner) |
| **Galpin Sugarcane** | Variable (set distance) | 2–4 min full recovery | Self-regulated (escalating) | 3–8 rounds | Anaerobic capacity, pacing | Galpin (practitioner) |

### 4.2 The Norwegian 4×4 Protocol — Gold Standard for VO2max

The Norwegian 4×4 is arguably the most well-validated interval protocol for improving VO2max. Developed by researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the protocol is:

- **Warm-up:** 10 minutes at easy pace
- **Work:** 4 × 4 minutes at 85–95% of HRmax
- **Recovery:** 3 minutes of active recovery (walking or easy jogging) between intervals
- **Cool-down:** 5–10 minutes easy

**Evidence:** Helgerud et al. (2007, *Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise*) demonstrated a 13% increase in VO2max in just 8 weeks with this protocol, compared to only 3.2% with steady-state training of equivalent total work. Wisløff et al. (2007) showed that 4×4 intervals improved cardiac function and reversed heart damage in heart failure patients. A study of untrained 50-year-olds showed that performing the Norwegian 4×4 just once per week for two years made their hearts functionally 20 years younger. (Sources: Science for Sport, 2025; Fysiofitaal analysis; Helgerud et al., 2007)

**Why This Matters for Hyrox:** VO2max was the strongest single predictor of Hyrox race performance (Brandt et al., 2025). The 4-minute work intervals fall right in the 6–9 minute "VO2max time domain" that Hinshaw identifies as the sweet spot for improving the ability to bring in and utilize oxygen. One to two sessions per week of Norwegian 4×4 intervals on the rower, bike, ski erg, or running track should be a staple for any Hyrox athlete in their general preparation phase.

### 4.3 How to Periodize Intervals Leading into a Hyrox Race

| Weeks Out from Race | Phase | Interval Focus | Example Session | Frequency |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 16–12 | Base Building | Zone 2 + short introduction to intervals | 1 × Norwegian 4×4 per week + 2–3 Zone 2 sessions | 1 interval + 2–3 Zone 2 |
| 12–8 | Aerobic Development | VO2max intervals + threshold work | Norwegian 4×4 (1×/wk) + threshold repeats (1×/wk) + Zone 2 (2×/wk) | 2 intervals + 2 Zone 2 |
| 8–4 | Race-Specific | Hyrox simulation intervals, station-to-run transitions | Race-pace station work + 1 km runs (1×/wk) + 30/30 intervals (1×/wk) + Zone 2 (1–2×/wk) | 2 intervals + 1–2 Zone 2 |
| 4–2 | Sharpening | Reduce volume, maintain intensity | Short sharp intervals (Tabata or 30/30) 1×/wk + 1 easy run + 1 race-pace session | 1–2 sessions, reduced volume |
| 2–0 | Taper | Reduce volume 40–60%, maintain intensity | 1 short interval session + 1 easy run + rest | Minimal, quality over quantity |

## 5. Concurrent Training Research

### 5.1 The Interference Effect: What the Science Actually Says

The "interference effect" was first documented by Hickson (1980), who showed that untrained men doing both strength and endurance training simultaneously had reduced strength gains compared to those doing strength training alone. This spawned decades of concern that "cardio kills gains."

**The Molecular Mechanism (Simplified):**

- **Resistance training** activates the **mTOR pathway** (Mammalian Target of Rapamycin), which drives muscle protein synthesis — the process of building new muscle tissue.
- **Endurance training** activates the **AMPK pathway** (AMP-activated protein kinase), which restores cellular energy balance by upregulating catabolic processes and inhibiting anabolic processes, including mTOR.
- These two pathways were once thought to act as a molecular "switch" — you're either building muscle (mTOR) or generating energy (AMPK), but not both simultaneously.

**What Modern Research Shows:**

Three major meta-analyses have now concluded that **concurrent training does not significantly compromise strength or hypertrophy gains** compared to resistance-training-only programs, provided total training load is managed appropri

## Original Prompt

```
You are a research analyst specializing in exercise physiology and endurance
coaching science. You're building a knowledge base for an AI Hyrox coach
that needs to make scientifically grounded training decisions.

### Key Figures to Research

**Chris Hinshaw** — Aerobic Capacity
- Founder of Aerobic Capacity programming
- Has coached 35+ CrossFit Games champions
- Known for: interval design, aerobic base building, pacing science
- Research his interval protocols, his philosophy on "the aerobic engine,"
  and how he programs for athletes who need both power and endurance

**Andy Galpin, PhD** — Exercise Physiology & Human Performance
- Professor of Kinesiology, known for bridging science and practice
- Huberman Lab podcast series on fitness was landmark content
- Known for: energy systems, adaptation science, training volume/intensity
  frameworks, recovery science, hydration, and periodization
- Research his frameworks for:
  - Energy system development (phosphagen, glycolytic, oxidative)
  - How to train each system and why it matters for Hyrox
  - His "9 adaptations of exercise" framework
  - Volume landmarks and recovery capacity
  - His views on concurrent training (strength + endurance)

### Additional Scientific Frameworks to Document

1. **Energy Systems for Hyrox**
   - How the 3 energy systems interact during a 60-90 min Hyrox race
   - Which stations are primarily glycolytic vs. oxidative
   - How to train each system with specific protocols
   - The "interference effect" and how to manage concurrent training

2. **Aerobic Base Development**
   - Zone 2 training: what it is, why it matters, how much is enough
   - MAF method and its applicability
   - How to build an aerobic base while maintaining strength
   - Lactate threshold training for Hyrox pacing

3. **Interval Training Science**
   - Tabata, Norwegian 4x4, 30/30, long intervals, short intervals
   - Which interval protocols target which adaptations
   - How to periodize interval training leading into a race
   - Chris Hinshaw's specific interval prescriptions

4. **Concurrent Training Research**
   - The latest science on training strength and endurance simultaneously
   - Molecular interference (AMPK vs. mTOR pathways)
   - Practical recommendations: session ordering, nutrition timing, recovery
   - How elite hybrid athletes manage this

5. **Recovery & Adaptation Science**
   - Sleep requirements for hybrid athletes
   - Nutrition periodization (fueling for training vs. race day)
   - HRV, readiness metrics, and autoregulation
   - Overtraining markers and how to monitor

6. **Testing & Benchmarking**
   - Key performance tests for Hyrox readiness
   - VO2max targets, lactate threshold benchmarks
   - Strength-to-bodyweight ratios that matter
   - How to track progress without over-testing

For each concept, provide:
- The scientific principle in plain language
- Why it matters specifically for Hyrox
- Practical application (how to implement in training)
- Specific protocols with sets, reps, durations, rest periods
- Citations or source references where possible

IMPORTANT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Length: This must be a LONG, EXHAUSTIVE document — at minimum 4,000-6,000 words. Do not summarize. This is the scientific backbone of the AI coach.
- Format: Use structured markdown with H2/H3 headers, markdown tables for protocols and benchmarks, and bullet lists for practical applications.
- Every protocol must be fully prescribed: intervals (work:rest, sets, intensity), zone training (HR ranges, RPE, duration), strength targets (% 1RM, sets x reps).
- Tables are critical: Use markdown tables for energy system comparisons, interval protocol parameters, testing benchmarks, and adaptation timelines.
- Cite sources: Reference Galpin, Hinshaw, specific studies, or podcast episodes by name inline. Distinguish between peer-reviewed science and practitioner opinion.
- This content will be chunked and embedded into a vector database for semantic search, so write in natural language that matches queries like "how should I train my aerobic base for Hyrox" or "give me a Chris Hinshaw style interval workout."
