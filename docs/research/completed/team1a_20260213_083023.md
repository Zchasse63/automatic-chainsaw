## 1. HYROX Event Format — Complete Reference

### 1.1 Core Concept

HYROX is an indoor mass-participation fitness race combining running and functional workout stations. It was co-founded by Christian Toetzke and designed by Mintra Tilly (Director of Sport). The format is standardised worldwide: **8 × 1 km runs** alternating with **8 functional workout stations**, always performed in the same fixed order. Every racer — regardless of division — runs the same total distance of **8 km**. Divisions differ only in the weights, loads, and (historically) rep counts at the stations.

### 1.2 Station Order and Race Sequence

The race always follows this exact sequence:

| Segment | Activity |
|---------|----------|
| Run 1 (1 km) | → |
| **Station 1** | SkiErg — 1,000 m |
| Run 2 (1 km) | → |
| **Station 2** | Sled Push — 50 m (4 × 12.5 m) |
| Run 3 (1 km) | → |
| **Station 3** | Sled Pull — 50 m (4 × 12.5 m) |
| Run 4 (1 km) | → |
| **Station 4** | Burpee Broad Jump — 80 m |
| Run 5 (1 km) | → |
| **Station 5** | Rowing — 1,000 m |
| Run 6 (1 km) | → |
| **Station 6** | Farmers Carry — 200 m |
| Run 7 (1 km) | → |
| **Station 7** | Sandbag Lunges — 100 m |
| Run 8 (1 km) | → |
| **Station 8** | Wall Balls — 100 reps |
| **→ Finish Line** | |

### 1.5 Course Layout

HYROX events are held in **large indoor venues** (convention centres, exhibition halls, arenas). The course layout follows a consistent template across all global events:

- **Running Track:** An approximately 1 km loop laid out **around the perimeter** (outside edge) of the venue. Depending on venue size, each 1 km run may consist of 1–5 laps. A dividing line splits the track into a **Fast Lane** (inside, for racers at ≤4:00/km pace) and a **Running Lane** (outside, for all others).
- **Roxzone (Transition Zone):** The central area **inside** the running track. Athletes enter and exit the Roxzone through clearly marked **IN and OUT arches** along one side of the running track. The Roxzone typically adds approximately **800 m to 1 km** of additional movement distance across the full race (jogging/walking between the running track and the workout stations).
- **Workout Stations:** All 8 stations are set up **inside** the Roxzone, in the centre of the venue. They are arranged sequentially so athletes proceed through them in order.
- **Start Tunnel:** A designated tunnel/chute where athletes assemble before their wave start.
- **Finish Line:** Positioned after the Wall Ball station (Station 8). Athletes proceed from Wall Balls to a "Finisher Stage" and cross the finish line.
- **Spectator Areas:** Marked zones adjacent to the Roxzone where spectators can watch the workout stations.

### 1.6 Wave Start System and Timing

HYROX uses a **wave start system** with waves departing at regular intervals, typically **every 10 minutes**. Key timing details:

- Each racer is assigned a specific start time communicated before race day and confirmed at check-in.
- The start time must be **written visibly on the racer's arm**.
- Starting in any wave other than the assigned one (without prior approval) results in **disqualification**.
- Racers within the same wave are always from the **same division** (e.g., all Men's Pro start together).
- A **timing chip** worn on the ankle records splits for each run, each Roxzone entry/exit, and each station completion. Doubles teams carry 2 chips; Relay teams carry 4.
- Racers must assemble in the **Start Zone Area** 10 minutes before their wave time.
- Wristband colour indicates division: White (Women's Open), Grey (Women's Pro / Men's Open), Black (Men's Pro), and/or Green (for specific identifiers).

### 1.7 Transition Zone (Roxzone) Rules and Penalties

| Rule | Detail | Penalty |
|------|--------|---------|
| Enter Roxzone via **IN arch** | Must use correct arch when coming off the running track | **2 min penalty** per infringement for using OUT arch to enter |
| Exit Roxzone via **OUT arch** | Must use correct arch when returning to running track | **2 min penalty** per infringement for using IN arch to exit |
| No outside assistance | No food, drink, or help from spectators/coaches in Roxzone | **3 min penalty** per infringement (classified as outside assistance) |
| Water provided at aid stations only | Fluids available at designated aid stations within Roxzone | Water is for **drinking only** — not for active cooling (pouring over body). 2 min penalty. |
| No littering | Paper cups and gel wrappers must be placed in bins | **2 min penalty** per infringement |
| No spitting / nose clearing on floor | Hygiene rule | **2 min penalty** per infringement |

### 1.8 Doubles Format Differences

HYROX Doubles is a **two-person team** format available in the following divisions:
- **Men's Doubles** (Open or Pro)
- **Women's Doubles** (Open or Pro)
- **Mixed Doubles** (Open only at regular events)

Key differences from Singles:

| Aspect | Singles | Doubles |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Running | Individual runs all 8 km | **Both partners run together** for all 8 × 1 km. Must stay together (penalty for separation: 1 min per run/station, DQ after 3rd infringement). |
| Stations | Individual completes every station | Partners **split each station** however they choose (e.g., one does 60 wall balls, the other does 40). Only one partner works at a time; the other waits. |
| Sled distances | 4 × 12.5 m | **8 × 12.5 m** (doubled distance for most stations) |
| Burpee Broad Jump | 80 m | **160 m total** (split between partners) |
| Farmers Carry | 200 m | **400 m total** (split between partners) |
| Sandbag Lunges | 100 m | **200 m total** (split between partners) |
| SkiErg | 1,000 m | **2,000 m total** |
| Rowing | 1,000 m | **2,000 m total** |
| Wall Balls | 100 reps | **200 reps total** |
| Weights (Open) | As per Open singles table | Same Open weights |
| Weights (Pro) | As per Pro singles table | Same Pro weights |
| Mixed Doubles | N/A | Uses **Men's Open weights** for all stations (which equals Women's Pro weights). Women's target height (2.70 m) for wall balls. |

### 1.9 Relay Format

The **Team Relay** is a 4-person event. Each team member completes **2 running segments and 2 workout stations**:
- Person 1: Run 1 → SkiErg → Run 2 → Sled Push
- Person 2: Run 3 → Sled Pull → Run 4 → Burpee Broad Jump
- Person 3: Run 5 → Rowing → Run 6 → Farmers Carry
- Person 4: Run 7 → Sandbag Lunges → Run 8 → Wall Balls

Available as Men's Relay, Women's Relay, and Mixed Relay. Uses Open weights.

### 2.3 Race Time Breakdown: Where Is Time Spent?

#### Scientific Data (Brandt et al., 2025 — Frontiers in Physiology)

A peer-reviewed study of 11 recreational HYROX athletes (median finish time 86.5 min, Individual Open Division) found:

| Component | Median Time | % of Total Race |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Total Running (8 km)** | 51.2 min | **~59%** |
| **Total Stations (8 stations)** | 32.8 min | **~38%** |
| **Roxzone / Transitions** | ~3–7 min (included in above) | **~3–7%** |
| **Full Race** | 86.5 min | 100% |

**Key finding:** Running time was **significantly longer** than station time (p = 0.003). Running accounts for approximately **50–60%** of total race time across all ability levels, with the percentage being slightly higher for slower athletes (who degrade more on later runs).

#### Elite vs. Average Breakdown (Roxlyfe.com Analysis — Pro Division)

| Component | Elite Men (~59 min) | Average Men (~90 min) | Elite Women (~66 min) | Average Women (~90 min) |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| **Total Running** | 30:46 (52%) | 42:26 (48%) | 34:27 (52%) | 44:09 (49%) |
| **Total Stations** | 25:10 (43%) | 39:50 (45%) | 28:48 (43%) | 39:49 (44%) |
| **Roxzone** | 2:54 (5%) | 6:58 (8%) | 3:47 (6%) | 6:12 (7%) |
| **Total** | 58:50 | 89:14 | 66:22 | 90:11 |

*(Source: roxlyfe.com "From Average to Elite" analysis)*

**Critical insight:** Running takes roughly **50–55%** of total time for elites and **48–50%** for average athletes (since slower athletes lose proportionally more time at stations). The Roxzone is **5–6% for elites** but balloons to **7–8%** for average athletes.

#### Station Time Rankings (Which Stations Take Longest)

Based on data from hyroxdatalab.com (200,000+ results) and the roxlyfe.com elite analysis:

**For recreational athletes (finishing ~1:30–1:40), from longest to shortest station time:**

| Rank | Station | Typical Time (Men, ~1:40 bracket) | Typical Time (Women, ~1:40 bracket) |
|------|---------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Wall Balls** | 8:02 | 6:30 |
| 2 | **Sled Pull** | 6:31 | 6:36 |
| 3 | **Burpee Broad Jump** | 5:15 | 6:00+ |
| 4 | **Sandbag Lunges** | 5:22 | 5:25 |
| 5 | **Rowing** | 4:35 | 5:12 |
| 6 | **SkiErg** | 4:17 | 4:51 |
| 7 | **Sled Push** | 3:40 | 3:48 |
| 8 | **Farmers Carry** | 2:32 | 2:45 |

**For elite athletes (finishing ~55–60 min):**

| Rank | Station | Typical Time (Elite Men) | Typical Time (Elite Women) |
|------|---------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1 | **Wall Balls** | 4:25 | 3:50 |
| 2 | **Rowing** | 3:58 | 4:29 |
| 3 | **SkiErg** | 3:47 | 4:12 |
| 4 | **Sled Pull** | 3:14 | 3:54 |
| 5 | **Sandbag Lunges** | 3:03 | 3:35 |
| 6 | **Sled Push** | 2:45 | 3:00 |
| 7 | **Burpee Broad Jump** | 2:21 | 3:11 |
| 8 | **Farmers Carry** | 1:37 | 1:57 |

### 2.4 The Biggest "Time Sinks" — Recreational vs. Elite

The **variance analysis** from hyroxdatalab.com (comparing 1:20 "advanced" to 1:40 "recreational" brackets) reveals which stations create the largest time gaps:

| Station | Time Variance (Men) | Time Variance (Women) | Priority Level |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| **Wall Balls** | **2:26** | **2:02** | 🔴 **HIGH** |
| **Roxzone (Total Transitions)** | **2:24** | **1:48** | 🔴 **HIGH** |
| **Burpee Broad Jump** | **1:47** | **2:08** | 🔴 **HIGH** |
| **Sandbag Lunges** | 1:27 | ~1:20 | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| **Sled Pull** | 1:16 | ~1:10 | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| **Sled Push** | 1:04 | ~0:50 | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| **Rowing** | 0:28 | ~0:30 | 🟢 LOW |
| **Farmers Carry** | 0:27 | ~0:25 | 🟢 LOW |
| **SkiErg** | 0:23 | ~0:25 | 🟢 LOW |

**Interpretation for coaches:**

- **Wall Balls** are the single biggest differentiator. A recreational male athlete averaging 8:02 vs. an advanced athlete at 5:36 — that's nearly **2.5 minutes** on one station alone. This is because wall balls demand sustained muscular endurance across 100 reps, and technique degrades rapidly under fatigue. A modest 20% improvement saves ~90 seconds.
- **Roxzone efficiency** is the "hidden" time sink. Elite athletes average **~28 seconds per transition** vs. ~52 seconds for recreational athletes. Over 8 transitions, that's **3:12 wasted** — with zero fitness required to improve it, just urgency and efficiency.
- **Burpee Broad Jumps** are the third-largest separator. They demand a unique combination of power, coordination, and cardio endurance that disproportionately punishes less fit athletes.
- **SkiErg, Rowing, and Farmers Carry** show the **smallest** variance. These are more "democratic" stations where technique and equipment constraints limit how much faster anyone can go. Focusing training time here yields diminishing returns.

The roxlyfe.com elite analysis shows an even more dramatic picture for the Sled Pull: elite men take 3:14 while average men take **6:31** — a ratio of 1:2, compared to a 1:1.3 ratio on Sled Push. The Sled Pull is disproportionately punishing for less-prepared athletes.

*(Source: hyroxdatalab.com "What is a Good HYROX Time?")*

#### Tier 1: Sub-60 Minutes (World Class / Elite Pro)

- **Who:** Full-time HYROX athletes competing in the Elite 15 series. Names like Alexander Roncevic (53:15 Men's Pro), Joanna Wietrzyk (56:03 Women's Pro), Lauren Weeks, Hunter McIntyre.
- **Running pace:** 3:30–4:00/km average across all 8 runs. Remarkably consistent pacing — first km at ~3:24, last km at ~4:15 (men's elite). The pace degradation is minimal (~50 seconds from first to last km).
- **Station characteristics:**
  - SkiErg: 3:40–4:00
  - Sled Push: 2:30–3:00
  - Sled Pull: 3:00–3:30
  - Burpee Broad Jumps: 2:15–3:00
  - Rowing: 3:45–4:10
  - Farmers Carry: 1:30–1:50
  - Sandbag Lunges: 2:50–3:20
  - Wall Balls: 3:45–4:30
- **Roxzone:** Total ~2:30–3:30. Average per transition: **~20–25 seconds**. They treat Roxzone as running — zero standing still.
- **Fitness characteristics:** VO₂max likely 55–70+ mL/kg/min. Sub-35 min 10K runners. Capable of 150+ kg deadlift. 100 wall balls unbroken in under 4:30 in training. Compromised running ability is exceptional — can maintain 4:00/km pace immediately after heavy sled work.
- **Training:** 8–12 sessions/week. Periodised with specific HYROX simulation blocks. Race-specific pacing work. 60–80 km running per week.

#### Tier 2: 60–75 Minutes (Competitive / Strong Recreational)

- **Who:** Experienced HYROX racers (3+ races), competitive age group athletes, former runners or CrossFitters who've adapted well.
- **Running pace:** 4:15–5:00/km. Moderate pace degradation — typically lose ~1:00–1:30 from first to last km.
- **Station characteristics:**
  - SkiErg: 4:00–4:30
  - Sled Push: 3:00–3:30
  - Sled Pull: 3:30–4:45
  - Burpee Broad Jumps: 3:00–4:45
  - Rowing: 4:00–4:40
  - Farmers Carry: 1:45–2:10
  - Sandbag Lunges: 3:20–4:30
  - Wall Balls: 5:00–6:15
- **Roxzone:** Total ~4:00–5:30. Average per transition: ~30–40 seconds.
- **Fitness characteristics:** VO₂max approximately 48–58 mL/kg/min. 5K time of 19–22 min. Solid general strength (bodyweight back squat, 1.5× bodyweight deadlift). Can complete 100 wall balls in 5–6 min fresh. Good but not elite compromised running.
- **Training:** 5–6 sessions/week. Blend of running (40–60 km/week), HYROX-specific station work 2–3×/week, and strength training 2–3×/week.

#### Tier 3: 75–90 Minutes (Solid Recreational)

- **Who:** Athletes with general fitness backgrounds. Often 2nd–4th HYROX race. May have a running OR strength bias but not both.
- **Running pace:** 5:00–5:45/km. Significant pace degradation — runs 6, 7, and 8 are often 60–90 seconds slower than runs 1–2.
- **Station characteristics:**
  - SkiErg: 4:15–4:50
  - Sled Push: 3:20–4:00
  - Sled Pull: 4:30–6:00 (sled pull is often where strength-deficient athletes struggle badly)
  - Burpee Broad Jumps: 4:30–6:00
  - Rowing: 4:30–5:15
  - Farmers Carry: 2:00–2:30
  - Sandbag Lunges: 4:00–5:30
  - Wall Balls: 6:00–7:30
- **Roxzone:** Total ~5:30–7:30. Average per transition: ~40–55 seconds. Often includes conscious "rest" pauses, water stops, and mental resets.
- **Fitness characteristics:** VO₂max approximately 40–50 mL/kg/min. 5K time of 22–26 min. Moderate strength levels. Wall balls may require 3–5 rest breaks during the set. Compromised running is a weakness — HR doesn't settle between stations.
- **Training:** 3–5 sessions/week. General fitness with some HYROX-specific prep. Running 20–40 km/week.

#### Tier 4: 90+ Minutes (Beginner / Completion-Focused)

- **Who:** First-time HYROX racers, general fitness enthusiasts, those training for completion not competition.
- **Running pace:** 5:45–7:00+/km. Massive pace degradation is common. Run 1 may be 5:00/km but Run 8 can exceed 7:00/km. Walking intervals common in later runs.
- **Station characteristics:**
  - SkiErg: 4:45–5:30+
  - Sled Push: 3:45–5:00+ (may need to rest mid-push on heavy sleds)
  - Sled Pull: 5:30–8:00+ (this station can become a major bottleneck; athletes may need 7+ minutes)
  - Burpee Broad Jumps: 5:30–8:00+
  - Rowing: 4:45–5:45
  - Farmers Carry: 2:20–3:15+ (grip failures, need to put down kettlebells multiple times)
  - Sandbag Lunges: 5:00–7:00+
  - Wall Balls: 7:00–10:00+ (frequent rest breaks, technique deterioration, no-reps)
- **Roxzone:** Total ~7:00–12:00+. Average per transition: ~52–90 seconds. Extended rest periods, deliberate water breaks, mental regrouping.
- **Fitness characteristics:** VO₂max approximately 35–45 mL/kg/min. 5K time of 26–32+ min. Strength may be limited — sled push/pull and wall balls feel genuinely heavy. Heart rate remains very elevated (>85% HRmax for most of race). Blood lactate peaks at wall balls (the final station) — research shows RPE reaches 18/20 (Borg scale) during wall balls for recreational athletes.
- **Training:** 2–4 sessions/week of general fitness. Limited HYROX-specific preparation. First-timers often improve **15–25%** from first to second race simply through experience, pacing knowledge, and station familiarity.

### 2.6 Typical Progression Timeline

Based on hyroxdatalab.com's progression data for a typical male athlete aged 30–34:

| Stage | Finish Time | Timeframe |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| First race | ~1:55:00 (beginner) | Day 1 |
| 6 months later | ~1:40:00 (intermediate) | +6 months (~13% improvement) |
| 1 year later | ~1:25:00 (advanced) | +1 year (~15% improvement) |
| 2 years later | ~1:15:00 (elite) | +2 years (~12% improvement) |

### 2.9 Physiological Demands Summary

From Brandt et al. (2025), the first peer-reviewed HYROX study:

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| HR max during race | 185 bpm (median) | Significantly higher during stations than runs |
| HR average during race | 170.9 bpm | Consistently hard to very hard intensity |
| % of race at "very hard" intensity (>90% HRmax) | 79.5% | Dominant intensity zone |
| % of race at "hard" intensity (70-90% HRmax) | 19.6% | — |
| Blood lactate max | 8.5 mmol/L | Peaked during wall balls (final station) |
| Blood lactate avg | 6.3 mmol/L | Sustained moderate-high lactate throughout |
| RPE max (Borg scale) | 18 / 20 | Highest at wall balls |
| Strongest performance predictor | VO₂max (ρ = -0.71) | Aerobic capacity is king |
| Second predictor | Body fat % (ρ = 0.67) | Lower body fat = faster time |
| Third predictor | Endurance training volume (ρ = -0.68) | More endurance training = better |
| Strength correlation | **Not significant** (p > 0.05) | HGS, muscle mass % did not correlate with total time |

**Key coaching implication:** HYROX is fundamentally an **endurance event** with strength components, not a strength event with running. The scientific data shows that once athletes have sufficient strength to handle the competition loads, further aerobic capacity development is the primary path to faster times. However, station-specific work remains critical for the high-variance stations (wall balls, burpee broad jumps, sled pull).

### 2.10 Training Time Allocation Recommendation (Based on Data)

The hyroxdatalab.com "70/30 Strategy" and roxlyfe.com analysis converge on the following evidence-based training allocation:

| Training Focus | Allocation | Rationale |
|---------------|------------|-----------|
| **Aerobic Base / Running** | 40–50% of total training | Running is 50–55% of race time. VO₂max is the #1 predictor. |
| **High-Variance Station Work** (Wall Balls, Burpee Broad Jumps, Sled Pull) | 25–30% of total training | These 3 stations + Roxzone account for **6–8 minutes** of potential time savings. |
| **Medium-Variance Station Work** (Sled Push, Sandbag Lunges) | 10–15% of total training | Moderate improvement opportunity (3–4 min savings). |
| **Low-Variance Station Work** (SkiErg, Rowing, Farmers Carry) | 5–10% of total training | Important for technique but limited time-saving leverage (1–2 min). |
| **Compromised Running Practice** | Embedded in above | Running immediately after station work is a critical HYROX-specific skill. |
| **Roxzone / Transition Practice** | Mental + habitual | "Free" time savings — requires urgency and efficiency, not fitness. Target <6.5% of total race time. |

## Original Prompt

```
You are a research analyst building a knowledge base for an AI-powered Hyrox coach.

Your task is to produce a comprehensive reference document covering TWO topics:

## 1. Hyrox Event Format (Complete Reference)

- Exact race structure: 8 x 1km runs + 8 functional workout stations
- Station order with EXACT distances, weights, and reps for EACH division:
  - Men's Open
  - Women's Open
  - Men's Pro
  - Women's Pro
  Present this as a detailed markdown table.
- Transition zone rules and penalties
- Equipment specifications (sled weights, sandbag weights, wall ball weights, SkiErg/rower models)
- Course layout (indoor venue, running track outside, stations inside)
- Wave start system and timing
- Doubles format differences
- Any recent rule changes for the 2025/26 season

## 2. Competitive Benchmarking

- Current world record times for Men and Women in EVERY division (Open, Pro, Doubles, Relay)
  Present as a markdown table with: Division | Record Holder | Time | Date | Location
- Age group world records for the major divisions
- Breakdown of where race time is spent:
  - Total running time vs total station time vs transition time
  - Which stations take the longest for most athletes
  - What percentage of total time is running vs working
- Performance tiers — what separates different finish times:
  - Sub-60 min (elite)
  - 60-75 min (competitive)
  - 75-90 min (solid recreational)
  - 90+ min (beginner)
  For each tier, describe typical running pace, station times, and fitness characteristics.
- Which stations are the biggest "time sinks" for recreational athletes vs elite athletes

IMPORTANT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Length: At minimum 3,000 words. Be exhaustive. Every detail matters for the AI coach.
- Format: Use structured markdown with H2/H3 headers and EXTENSIVE use of markdown tables.
- Tables are critical: Station weights/reps by division, world records, performance tier comparisons.
- Be specific: Include actual numbers, times, weights — not generalities.
- Cite sources: Reference the official Hyrox rulebook, roxlyfe.com, hybridfitnessmedia.com, or other sources by name.
- This content will be chunked and embedded into a vector database for semantic search.
