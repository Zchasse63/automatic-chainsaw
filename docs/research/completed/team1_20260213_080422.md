The race was \ndesigned by Mintra Tilly, who also wrote the rulebook.\nHYROX consists of a 1 km run followed by 1 station, \nrepeated 8 times. In order to complete the entire \nHYROX race and receive a valid finishing time, the \nracers must complete the runs and stations in the \nspecific order [Run 1, workout station 1, Run 2, \nworkout station 2, etc.] until they have completed a \ntotal of 8 km running and 8 stations.\nWhilst the repetition range and/or weights differ \nbetween the divisions, the running distance remains \nthe same across all divisions: each racer must run 1 \nkm before each, i.e. a total distance of 8 km.\nThe results and ranking system are based on the \nfastest time in each respective division. Results \nare sorted from the fastest to the slowest time. In \naddition to the overall fastest men\u2019s and women\u2019s \ntimes, results are also ranked in age groups [see \nbelow], also sorted from the fastest to the slowest \ntime.\n\nHYROX EN SINGLE RULEBOOK_25/26\n5\n2 CONDITIONS OF \nPARTICIPATION\nHYROX is a race open to everyone, qualifications are \nnot required.\nBy participating in HYROX you are agreeing to the \nfollowing conditions, which include the exclusion of \nliability and the terms of the Privacy Policy which can \nbe read at https://hyrox.com/terms-and-conditions/.\n1 \nIn order to participate in a HYROX event, racers \nmust be at least 16 years old on the day of race.\n2 \nOfficial rankings will be based on racers\u2019 biological \ngender at birth. However, individuals who wish to \nparticipate for recreational purposes only, without \nbeing included in the official ranking, may register \nunder their gender identity.\n3 \nEach racer must agree to the terms and conditions \nof participation.\n4 \nThe only way to register for a HYROX event is via \nwww.hyrox.com.\n2.1 CONDITIONS OF \nPARTICIPATION IN HYROX\n2.2 PRECONDITIONS FOR \nPARTICIPATION\nPregnant women are welcome to participate.

Its standardized format enables athletes to compete worldwide on equal footing. Whether you\u2019re a beginner or a seasoned competitor, understanding the divisions and their specific requirements is key to planning your training and race strategy.\n\nThis guide dives into the HYROX divisions, the unique challenges of each, the weights used in workout stations, and the inspiring world records that push athletes to their limits.\n\n**HYROX Divisions Overview**\n\nHYROX features multiple divisions to accommodate a variety of fitness levels, goals, and team formats:\n\n**Open Division**: Designed for newcomers and recreational athletes. It features lighter weights, making it accessible yet challenging. **Pro Division**: Tailored for advanced athletes, with heavier weights and higher demands on strength and endurance. **Doubles Division**: A two-person team race where the workload is shared. You run together but split the workout stations strategically. **Relay Division**: A four-person team event perfect for groups or gyms. Each participant completes two running segments and two workout stations. **Adaptive Division**: A supportive and inclusive category for athletes with permanent impairments, featuring adjustments based on individual needs.\n\nEach division is further divided by age groups, ensuring fair competition among athletes of similar ages.\n\n**A Breakdown of the Eight HYROX Workout Stations by Division**\n\nThe HYROX race format consists of 1 km of running followed by a functional fitness workout station, repeated eight times. Below are the details for each division:\n\n**1. SkiErg (1,000 meters)** **Weights and Rules**: **All Divisions**: No weight differences; the focus is on completing 1,000 meters. **Damper Settings**:\n\n- Women: 5\n\n- Men/Women Pro: 6\n\n- Men Pro: 7\n\n\n\nIn team divisions (Doubles and Relay), participants can adjust the damper settings before starting but cannot change them mid-station.\n\n**2. Sled Push (50 meters)** **Weights by Division**:\n\n- Women Open: 102 kg\n\n- Women Pro/Men Open: 152 kg\n\n- Men Pro: 202 kg\n\n- Doubles: Shares the weight for their division.\n\n- Relay: Uses Open division weights, split among team members.\n\nThis station requires immense leg strength and coordination, especially in the Pro division.\n\n**3. Sled Pull (50 meters)** **Weights by Division**:\n\n- Women Open: 78 kg\n\n- Women Pro/Men Open: 103 kg\n\n- Men Pro: 153 kg\n\n- Doubles and Relay: Same weight standards as Sled Push for each respective division.\n\nGrip strength, endurance, and a steady pace are essential for success here.\n\n**4. Burpee Broad Jump (80 meters)** **All Divisions**:\n\nNo weight differences. Athletes must jump forward from a burpee position, covering 80 meters in total.\n\nThis station tests agility and endurance, regardless of the division.\n\n**5. Rowing (1,000 meters)** **Weights and Rules**:\n\n- Identical damper settings as SkiErg.\n\n- Distance: 1,000 meters for all divisions.\n\nRowing emphasizes both cardiovascular fitness and efficient pacing.\n\n**6. Farmers Carry (200 meters)** **Weights by Division**:\n\n- Women Open: 2 x 16 kg kettlebells\n\n- Women Pro/Men Open: 2 x 24 kg kettlebells\n\n- Men Pro: 2 x 32 kg kettlebells\n\n- Doubles: Split the workload, with weights matching their respective division.\n\n- Relay: Open weights divided among team members.\n\nGrip and core strength are critical to maintaining control over the weights during this station.\n\n**7. Sandbag Lunges (100 meters)** **Weights by Division**:\n\n- Women Open: 10 kg\n\n- Women Pro/Men Open: 20 kg\n\n- Men Pro: 30 kg\n\n- Doubles: Split the workload as per division standards.\n\n- Relay: Uses Open division weights.\n\nThis station demands both lower-body strength and stability.\n\n**8. Wall Balls (Final Station)** **Reps and Weights by Division**:\n\n- Women Open: 75 reps, 4 kg ball\n\n- Women Pro: 100 reps, 6 kg ball\n\n- Men Open: 100 reps, 6 kg ball\n\n- Men Pro: 100 reps, 9 kg ball\n\n- Doubles: Workload is shared; weights align with division standards.\n\n- Relay: Open division standards split among team members.\n\nTarget heights differ as well:\n\n- Women: 2.7 meters\n\n- Men: 3.0 meters\n\nWall Balls are a challenging finale, testing mental toughness and endurance after seven intense stations.\n\n**Relay Division: Teamwork at Its Core**\n\nThe Relay division is an exciting option for groups.

          "snippet": "Not all HYROX stations are created equal. While every station matters, some show dramatically larger time differences between advanced and intermediate athletes. Understanding which stations offer the greatest opportunity for improvement is crucial for efficient training.\n\nWe analyzed 200,000+ race results from athletes finishing in 1:20 (advanced), 1:30 (intermediate), and 1:40 (recreational) brackets. The findings reveal where slower athletes lose the most time - and where focused training can yield the biggest gains.\n\n#### Key Takeaway\n\n**Note on Running:** While this analysis focuses on workout stations, running accounts for ~50-55% of total race time and shows significant variance between brackets (8+ minutes difference). We cover running strategy and pace management in detail in our article The Mid-Race Crisis: When and Why You Slow Down.\n\n## The Variance Analysis\n\nTime variance measures how much the average time differs between the fastest (1:20) and slowest (1:40) brackets for each station. Stations with high variance represent larger improvement opportunities - these are where fitness level has the biggest impact.\n\nThe chart above ranks stations by their time variance between brackets. The longer the bar, the more time separates advanced from recreational athletes on that station.\n\n## High-Impact Stations: Where Time Is Won or Lost\n\n### Wall Balls: The #1 Differentiator\n\n**Time Variance:** Men 2:26, Women 2:02\n\nWall Balls consistently emerge as the single biggest separator between brackets. Advanced male athletes average 5:36, while recreational athletes take 8:02 - a massive 146-second difference. For women, the gap is 122 seconds (4:28 vs 6:30).\n\n**Why such a large gap?**\n\n- Requires sustained strength endurance (100 reps)\n\n- Technique breaks down under fatigue\n\n- Height disadvantage compounds over many reps\n\n- Mental challenge of high rep count\n\n**Training implication:** Even moderate Wall Ball improvements translate to significant time savings. A 20% improvement for a recreational athlete means saving ~90 seconds on this station alone.\n\n### RoxZone: The Hidden Time Drain\n\n**Time Variance:** Men 2:24, Women 1:48\n\nRoxZone - the cumulative time spent transitioning between stations - is the second-largest differentiator. Advanced athletes average ~21 seconds per transition (total ~5:45), while recreational athletes take ~30+ seconds (total ~8:10).\n\n**What's happening:**\n\n- Advanced athletes recover faster between efforts\n\n- Better movement efficiency and station setup\n\n- Less hesitation and quicker mental transitions\n\n- Superior cardiovascular fitness enables faster recovery\n\n**Training implication:** RoxZone improvements are \"free\" time savings - they require no additional fitness, just practice and efficiency. Saving 5 seconds per transition = 40 seconds total.\n\n### Burpee Broad Jumps: Technique + Power\n\n**Time Variance:** Men 1:47, Women 2:08\n\nThis station shows high variance, particularly for women (128 seconds difference). The combination of explosive power, coordination, and cardio endurance creates a challenging test that separates fitness levels.\n\n**Key factors:**\n\n- Burpee technique efficiency\n\n- Broad jump power and technique\n\n- Pace management over 80 meters\n\n- Fatigue resistance\n\n## Medium-Impact Stations\n\n**Sandbag Lunges** (1:27 variance), **Sled Pull** (1:16), and **Sled Push** (1:04) show moderate variance. These stations still offer improvement opportunities but to a lesser degree than the top three.\n\nThese stations are more \"democratized\" - recreational athletes can achieve respectable times with proper technique, even without elite fitness levels.\n\n## Low-Impact Stations: Less Leverage\n\n**Row** (0:28 variance), **Farmers Carry** (0:27), and **SkiErg** (0:23) show the smallest time differences between brackets. While you should still train these movements, they offer less leverage for time improvement compared to high-variance stations.\n\n**Why such small variance?**\n\n- More technique-dependent (skill matters more than pure fitness)\n\n- Shorter duration (less time to accumulate differences)\n\n- Equipment limits (can't go faster than machine/implement allows)\n\n- Natural movement patterns (less specialized)\n\n## What About Running?\n\nIt's important to note that while this analysis focuses on workout stations,\n\n**running is actually the largest component of HYROX** - accounting for approximately 50-55% of total race time. The variance in total running time between brackets is substantial (8+ minutes difference from 1:20 to 1:40).\n\nHowever, running improvement is a different beast - it's about aerobic base development, pacing strategy, and managing pace degradation across the race. We cover this in depth in our dedicated running analysis: The Mid-Race Crisis: When and Why You Slow Down.\n\n**The optimal approach:** Build your aerobic base through consistent running (the foundation), then layer in station-specific work focused on the high-variance stations identified above. You need both, but they're developed differently.\n\n## The 70/30 Training Strategy\n\nBased on this analysis, here's how to allocate your HYROX-specific training time:\n\n**70% of station-specific work:** **Wall Balls**- Technique, pacing, and endurance work **Transition Practice**- Mock RoxZone setups and practise compromised running **Burpee Broad Jumps**- Technique refinement and power development\n\n**30% of station-specific work:**\n\n4. Sled movements (Push/Pull)\n\n5. Sandbag Lunges\n\n6. Remaining stations (Row, Farmers, SkiErg)\n\nThis doesn't mean ignore the \"low-impact\" stations - it means prioritize your time wisely. A 10% improvement in Wall Balls saves you more time than a 20% improvement in SkiErg.\n\n## Priority Matrix: Your Action Plan\n\n|Priority Level|Stations|Total Potential Time Savings|\n|--|--|--|\n|High|Wall Balls, RoxZone, Burpee Broad Jumps|6-8 minutes|\n|Medium|Sandbag Lunges, Sled Pull, Sled Push|3-4 minutes|\n|Low|Row, Farmers Carry, SkiErg|1-2 minutes|\n#### Key Takeaway\n\nFocus your training on high-variance stations. Improving your Wall Balls by 90 seconds, tightening your RoxZone by 60 seconds, and shaving 45 seconds off Burpees could drop your total time by over 3 minutes - without improving your running at all.\n\n## Practical Application\n\n**For 1:30 athletes targeting 1:20:**\n\nYour biggest opportunities are Wall Balls (save over 1 min) and RoxZone (save over 1 min). Focus here first combined with aerobic capacity.\n\n**For 1:40 athletes targeting 1:30:**\n\nWall Balls (save ~1:15), RoxZone (save ~1:15), and Burpees (save ~1 min) offer the most potential in combination with aerobic capacity.\n\n**For all athletes:**\n\nTrack your split times for each station and compare them to your target bracket averages. Identify your worst 2-3 stations relative to the benchmark and make them training priorities.\n\n## Beyond the Numbers\n\nWhile this analysis reveals where time differences exist, remember that your individual strengths and weaknesses matter. If your Wall Balls are already competitive but your SkiErg is significantly slower than average, address your personal limiters first.\n\nUse this analysis as a framework for efficient training allocation, but personalize it based on your race results and current abilities.\n\n**Want more data-driven HYROX insights?** Subscribe to our newsletter for regular analysis and training strategies based on real race data.

          "snippet": "While HYROX is a relatively straightforward event, even experienced athletes can make mistakes which cost them time and energy.\n\nHere\u2019s some of the main ones to avoid in your next HYROX\u2026\n\n**1. Starting Out Too Quickly**\n\nIt is crucial to pace yourself during a HYROX event. It\u2019s very easy to start out much quicker than you ideally should \u2013 especially with all the excitement of the day. However, that can mean you make the latter stages of the race very hard for yourself.\n\nI now purposely hold myself back a bit on the first few runs so not to exhaust myself too early. As well as the runs, the Ski and Sled Push are stations where some pacing often makes sense. However, they are also stations that athletes typically try to do as quickly as they can. Slowing down a few seconds on these often pays dividends later in the race.\n\nClick here to find out more about how to improve your performance on the HYROX Sled Push, and this article that takes about how to pace your running at HYROX.\n\n**2. Not Training Compromised Running**\n\nThe running during a HYROX event can feel much harder (and slower) than running a similar distance in isolation. The difference between running 1km on fresh legs, and running 1km after 100 meters of lunges, for example, is significant. Training this type of \u201ccompromised running\u201d, so that it\u2019s less of a shock during the race, is important.\n\nTo read more on compromised running, and how to train for it, check out this article.\n\n**3. Not Tapering Training**\n\nWhen I look on Instagram and see the amount of training certain competitors are still putting in during the week before a HYROX event, it always astounds me. I don\u2019t think we should believe everything we see on Instagram, of course. However, suffice to say, for the majority of people, tapering down your training in the 1-2 weeks prior to the race is usually a great idea if you want to feel fresh during the race.\n\nWe talk more about the important of a taper, and how to do it, as well as some of the main considerations, in this article on \u201cHow to Taper Training for a HYROX\u201d.\n\n**4. Incorrect Laps**\n\nOne mistake made surprisingly often is for a competitor to run too many, or too few, laps of the arena. It varies by venue, but typically you need to run 2-4 laps of the circuit to cover the 1km distance. However, when you\u2019re deep into the race, fatigued, it\u2019s easy to lose count. Too many laps and you cost yourself time and energy. Too few laps and you\u2019ll get a time penalty.\n\nAs well as (obviously) counting the laps in your head, you can, and should, try to use the screen in the venue which tells you what lap you\u2019re on. That\u2019s not always easy to see though, so for additional tips on avoiding this problem refer to our running pace article where I discuss how I use my watch to time my laps.\n\n**5. CrossFit Shoes**\n\nChoosing the most appropriate footwear for HYROX is critical. One mistake many beginners to the sport make is to wear CrossFit type shoes \u2013 such as Nike Metcons or Reebok Nanos \u2013 for the race. They would, in general, be great for the functional exercises, but a huge portion of the race is running, and they simply aren\u2019t as good as most traditional running shoes for that job.\n\nTo read up more on the best footwear for HYROX, check out the linked article.\n\n**6. Not Testing Footwear**\n\nNo matter what shoe you select, you should test it out beforehand, especially on a sled push. There are 2 potential issues that could happen here. One is that a lack of grip on the underside of the shoe could mean that your feet slip when you push the sled. Another is your heel can slip out the back of the shoe, again when pushing the sled. This last issue can often (but not always) be resolved by using \u201cHeel Lock Lacing\u201d.\n\n**7. Slowing in Roxzone**\n\nWe\u2019ve spoken about this plenty on the site (in this article, and this article, for example), but one mistake athletes often make, especially when they are new to HYROX, is they slow down quite considerably in Roxzone (if you aren\u2019t sure what the Roxzone is, watch this video).\n\nAwareness of this is the first step. It\u2019s easy to subconsciously slow down as you enter the zone. I\u2019ve done it myself in the past. But it\u2019s not necessary.\n\nOne reason people spend a lot of time in the Roxzone is because it\u2019s where you can get a drink of water. While this may be necessary to some extent, hydrate well before the race to minimise the amount you need during the race.\n\nIt\u2019s also sometimes possible for people to get a little lost in the Roxzone, and not know the direction they need to be heading for the next stage of the race. To help avoid this issue, familiarise yourself with the layout prior to the race starting. You\u2019ll be sent the floor plan as part of the Athlete\u2019s Guide and technical briefing video in the few days prior to the event to help with this.\n\n**8. Forgetting to Chalk Hands**\n\nChalk is primarily helpful on the sled pull and the farmers carries at HYROX as it provides some added grip. This can be very much needed during a hot, sweaty race.\n\nHowever, when you just want to get on with things as quickly as possible, chalking your hands is an easy thing to forget. It is time well invested though. If you lose your grip on the farmers carries, for example, and need to repeatedly stop to put the kettlebells down as a result, that will eat into your time.\n\n**9. No Reps / Not Knowing Movement Standards**\n\nMaking sure you follow the movement standards described in the HYROX rulebook is very important. If your technique is not where it needs to be, and the judge observing you gives you some \u201cno reps\u201d, this is valuable time that will be added to your finishing time.\n\nThis is especially common on the burpee broad jumps and wall balls, in particular. Ensure you have familiarised yourself with the movement standards on these well in advance, and practiced adhering to them in your training sessions.\n\n**10. Stations in Wrong Order**\n\nAthletes have sometimes been known to complete the functional stations in the wrong order. Doing so results in a time penalty. This is a surprisingly simple mistake to make when you are extremely fatigued in the midst of a race. Again, using the screen at the venue can help here as it tells you where you need to head next. Do also try to ensure you have the correct order very well memorised in your head before starting (check our Beginner\u2019s Guide to HYROX if need be).\n\n**11. Last Minute Panic**\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to think about before a race (checking in your bag, putting timing chip round ankle, going to the toilet at the right time, moving your way around a busy venue, etc). This can often lead to panic. Spiking your heart rate because you\u2019re stressed, before the race has even started, is not good prep for a good performance. In this \u201cPre HYROX Race Routine\u201d article we talk some more about planning the time before a race so start it in a good mental state.\n\n**12. HYROX Simulations**\n\nThe standardisation of a HYROX event can lead many athletes to perform numerous HYROX simulations (or scaled versions of one) in their training. There\u2019s nothing wrong with doing that occasionally but doing them too often may not be the best approach. A full HYROX can be extremely tiring and take a fair few days (for most people) to recover from. Do too many, too often, and you\u2019ll risk injury.\n\nIt\u2019s probably also not optimal from a training perspective. For example, just doing 1 set of 100m lunges each week likely isn\u2019t the best way to improve your 100m lunge time. Splitting up the total you do into more manageable sets, perhaps with heavier weights, and progressively overloading over time, can often be more effective, as well as being easier to recover from.\n\nTo reiterate, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a bad idea to occasionally replicate a HYROX race in your training; I would just be careful of making the mistake of doing it too often. If you do need help with training for the event, check out our personalised coaching options, or our 12 Week Training Plan.\n\n**13. Changing Your Diet**\n\nYou\u2019ve heard about the need for more carbs (for energy) and decide a pre-race pasta party might be in order? Or a supplement company convinced you to buy a box of energy gels which you plan to chug down minutes before the race? Be careful. Dramatically changing what you eat in the days and hours before a race can be a big, all too common mistake. To be clear, I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s something wrong with increased carb intake, or energy gels or anything like that. But don\u2019t leave it until just before the race to find out how you respond to those. Instead, it\u2019s something you should be testing well in advance. For example, energy gels can cause digestive distress for some people. Do you really want to find you\u2019re one of those people mid-HYROX? Probably not, and I\u2019m guessing the other athletes around you don\u2019t either!\n\nHopefully these tips will help you avoid any mistakes for your next HYROX.\n\n",

          "snippet": "## Jump to:\n\nThe increasing popularity of Hyrox means everyone is looking at ways they can improve their time. And with 8km of running and eight different stations interspersed throughout \u2013 not to mention the equally important 'Roxzone' \u2013 there's plenty of opportunities to both make up and lose time over the course of an event.\n\nBut how does your time compare to the average on the SkiErg, sled push or wall balls? Data compiled from both the pro and open divisions allows for simple comparison with your fellow competitors, while an expert currently at the top of the sport has offered his guidance on how to get faster.\n\n## What Is the Average Hyrox Finish Time for Men?\n\nAccording to RoxHype, the average Hyrox finish time across men of all ages in the pro division is 1:22:24 in 2025, with Alexander Roncevic's world record of 53:15 set in Hamburg 2025 blitzing that in remarkable fashion.\n\nWhen it comes to the open division, where weights are lighter and more accessible to men of all ages and abilities, the average finishing time is 1:26:42.\n\n## What Is the Average Time for Each Hyrox Station?\n\nWith Hyrox races featuring eight challenging stations, plus 8km of total running and even time in the Roxzone, there's plenty of variance between the pro and open divisions. These are the average times it takes men to complete all the stations in each division:\n\n## How to Improve Your Hyrox Time\n\nJake Dearden is a world record holder in the pro doubles division, setting a time of 50:04 alongside James Kelly. He also competes individually in the Elite 15. While running accounts for 50% of the race, and has to be a key area of focus for anyone wanting to get quicker, Dearden offers the following tips to improve across the board.\n\n## 1. Pace Yourself\n\nDespite the intense nature of a Hyrox, it epitomises the cliche of being a 'marathon not a sprint'. Yes, you will have plenty of energy as you start your first kilometre run. But no, that doesn't mean you should try and complete it as quickly as possible.\n\n'Think about a race in order of importance, so starting off with your SkiErg [the first workout station] \u2013 that\u2019s the most important exercise,' Dearden notes. 'If your heart rate skyrockets at the ski and you struggle, that\u2019s going to fatigue you for the rest of the race. But if you get fatigued at the burpees [the fourth station], you\u2019ve had a good first half of the race. You need to focus on these things in order of importance, but don\u2019t neglect any of them. If your wall balls really suffer, work on them.'\n\n## 2. Run Fatigued\n\nIt's all well and good being a strong runner, but if you're unable to keep cycling your legs after 100m of sandbag lunges, then you're always going to struggle. 'I always look at the [workout station] and the run as one exercise, so if you\u2019re a strength athlete and you\u2019re amazing at the sled push, look at your sled push and your running time after as one exercise,' Dearden says.\n\n'You might be really good at the sled push, but then your running might drop off a cliff. If you\u2019re a stronger athlete and you\u2019re not very good at running, you need to get better at it. You can\u2019t neglect anything.'\n\n## 3. The 'Roxzone' Is Equally Important\n\nThe area between the running track and the individual stations, the Roxzone offers athletes a chance for a breather \u2013 but try not to lean too far into the transitionary phase it feels like. As Dearden points out, this is a race and the clock never stops, 'from the minute you start to the minute you cross the finish line there's no dead time, so make sure that you are moving at\n\n*all* times'.\n\n## 4. Fuel Properly\n\nCarbohydrates provide essential energy to perform at your best come race day, so don't worry about dieting down just so you have visible abs in the run up to the event. 'Realistically, Hyrox is an endurance event, but it's one where we're working at a really high heart rate for the majority of the race,' Dearden says. 'We're probably working at 80 to 90% of our thresholds throughout, which to be clear, requires carbohydrates'.\n\n## 5. Nothing New on Race Day\n\nFor those of you that have ever run a half or full marathon, this phrase will sound familiar. While this generally relates to keeping your nutrition and hydration the same \u2013 and wearing shoes or clothing that you know will stay comfortable after over an hour of vigorous exercise \u2013 it also means not going much quicker on the SkiErg than you're used to, just because you feel good and the adrenaline is getting the better of you.\n\n'Whatever you do in training, that's what you do on race day,' advises Dearden. 'Don't do anything new. Don't be looking at the person next to you or looking at the elite athletes and copying what they do, because that might not work.'\n\nRyan Dabbs\n\nRyan is a Senior Writer at\n\n*Men\u2019s Health* *UK* with a passion for storytelling, health and fitness.

          "snippet": "## Why should I use heart rate training?\n\n**Optimised VO2Max Training:**Targeting sessions at 95% of maximum heart rate enables HYROX athletes to effectively enhance their VO2Max. Short, intense intervals within this heart rate zone are crucial for boosting aerobic capacity, essential for the high-energy demands of HYROX. **Effective Threshold Work:**Utilising heart rate monitoring to train at lactate threshold intensity is vital for HYROX.\n\n\u2026\n\n**Tailored Training Intensities:**Heart rate data allows HYROX competitors to customise their training. Using heart rate zones for easy recovery runs ensures proper recovery, while higher zones on interval days align efforts with training goals. **Preventing Overtraining:**Regular heart rate monitoring during different training phases helps HYROX athletes avoid overtraining. By ensuring high-intensity days are truly challenging and rest days are used for recovery, it maintains a balanced training regime.Limitations of Heart Rate Training\n\nDespite these advantages, heart rate training also has its limitations.\n\n\u2026\n\n**Zone 3 - High Aerobic Zone (tempo - 70-80%MHR)**\n\nThe high aerobic zone is just above your aerobic threshold. Training here will see similar benefits of training in zone 2, however you\u2019re also subjecting your body to more stress, which can impede subsequent more important sessions in the week (VO2Max and Threshold work). If the race you are training for lies within this zone (\u00bd marathon/marathon) then you still need to spend some time here to understand your race pace.\n**Zone 4 - Threshold Zone (**80-90% **MHR**)\n\nZone 4 skirts around your second Lactate Threshold (LT2). At this point you become better at withstanding lactic acid and removing it, and you are able to increase your anaerobic threshold closer to your VO2 max. This means you can race harder for longer. Training in Zone 4 can lead to significant performance gains but should be balanced with adequate recovery.",

          "snippet": "**Heart-Rate Zones **\n\nUnderstanding how your body produces and uses energy is essential for improving performance in running and HYROX. Training in the right heart-rate zones targets different energy systems, allowing you to build endurance, speed, strength, and race-specific efficiency.\n\n**Zone 1 \u2013 Recovery (50\u201360% max HR):**\n\n\u2026\n\nAerobic base training is the foundation of all HYROX performance. It develops the low-intensity engine that allows you to run efficiently, recover faster between stations, and handle long race duration\u2019s without your heart rate drifting too high. Zone 2 training strengthens the cardiovascular system, increases mitochondrial density, improves fat utilisation, and stabilises your pacing ability.\n\n\u2026\n\nAerobic intervals sit at the low end of Zone 3, around 70\u201375% of your maximum heart rate. This is close to your HYROX running pace during the first few runs, and lets you accumulate more quality running time. A session like three sets of 1.5 km with a 400-metre jog between efforts is a strong example.",

Unless you are lucky enough to get an air con environment but even then air cons are extremally dehydrating so while you may not be sweating you will still need to offset this.\n\n- If your race lasts over 75 mins or you\u2019re a heavy sweater, aim for 200 - 300 ml of fluid every 25 - 30 minutes.\n\n- Include electrolytes (especially sodium) to avoid cramps and to retain fluids.",

If you\u2019re a particularly heavy or salty sweater you may wish to up this slightly, or even supplement sodium intake as the most abundant electrolyte found in sweat.\nAgain on the day of the event we recommend sipping on 500ml of electrolyte mix in the three hours before the start. This ensures adequate hydration if you\u2019ve become dehydrated in the night or during travel to the venue.

And I will keep an eye on this during the race.\n\nHowever, when pacing your runs, you need to appreciate that not all the runs are exactly 1km. HYROX have told me that the total race distance (including the Roxzone) is 8.7km. Therefore, if there is a big Roxzone, it\u2019s possible that each run will be less than 1km (or vice versa). This is something I try to make an estimation of in advance based on the floor plan (which you are sent prior to the event).\n\nSecondly, the first run of the eight is normally shorter or longer than the rest of the runs. This is due to the start line being at a different point to the Roxzone exit. The extent of this changes from race to race. As just one example, in Manchester in January 2023, the first run was probably 200m longer than the others.\n\nBecause I aim to pace my runs to a specific time, I need to adjust my target run pace to account for the different distances of the runs. For example, let\u2019s suppose you know you want to run 4:30m/km. If you estimate the first run to be 1.2km, then you\u2019ll want to run 5:24m for your first run. Failure to do this, could result in you starting the race much too fast or slow.\n\nFor tips on determining your race pace, then check out this article.\n\n**#2. Pace the Ergs**\n\nIt\u2019s worth appreciating that a lot of extra effort on the Ski erg and row machine often doesn\u2019t result in a significantly quicker time. Trying to Ski / Row as quick as you possibly can, will likely exhaust you for the rest of the race. Whereas if you just slow yourself down by, say, 10-15 seconds over the 1km distance, that saves you a LOT of energy.\n\nFinding the appropriate balance between energy expended and time gained on\n\n__all__ elements of HYROX is important. But this is especially the case on the erg machines where a lot more energy often doesn\u2019t go a long way.\n\n**#3. Pace the Sled Push**\n\nI promise this whole article isn\u2019t about just pacing yourself, but it is important! Learning the extent to which you can push on the sled push without ruining your legs can make or break your race. If you smash through the sled push in no time at all, but then can\u2019t walk properly afterwards, you went too quick! This is a mistake even the Elite of the sport make, with many male competitors seemingly ruining their race at the 2023 North American Championships after going too fast on the sled push.\n\nIf you have previously competed in HYROX, I would encourage you to look at your running splits before and after the sled push. Do they slow dramatically? If so, you possibly started out running too fast, or you went too fast on the sled push and couldn\u2019t recover properly afterwards.\n\nFinding the right balance does come from experience, and training, but just being aware of its importance is a starting point. Personally, I find that a short pause halfway on each length (so every 6.25m) helps a lot compared to trying to do each length unbroken.\n\n**#4. Stay Out the Madness**\n\nAt the beginning of each HYROX there can be a LOT of people starting alongside you. In Birmingham in Oct 2022, the Men\u2019s wave had 50 people starting at a time. Personally, I try and stay to the side, or the back, of this group of very excited, pumped up, testosterone fuelled men! Maybe I\u2019m just overly cautious \u2013 and to be fair I\u2019ve never seen it happen \u2013 but it feels as if the greatest risk of being accidentally tripped / pushed over at any point during a HYROX is in those first few seconds. So, I try and stay out of the hustle and bustle to minimise risk without really costing myself time. Your timing chip doesn\u2019t start until you cross the start line anyway, so it doesn\u2019t really matter if you\u2019re not right at the front.\n\n**#5. Full Send Farmers**\n\nAs tough as HYROX is, when I think about it, there are very few individual components of the race which I am doing as fast as I possibly can. Even on the lunges, late in the race, you hold back a tiny amount so you can actually run afterwards. But the farmers carry is one where I think it\u2019s worth doing as quick as humanly possible. That will lessen the number of times you need to put the kettlebells down on the floor (if you do at all). You also don\u2019t really need much grip strength for the rest of the race. So going all out on the farmers is worthwhile.\n\n**#6. Sled Pull Hustle**\n\nIf you look at a lot of people on the sled pull, the amount of time spent actually pulling the sled, relative to the total amount of time they spend in the sled push station, is very small. They often walk (as opposed to run) from one end of the lane to the other and will take long rests between each pull of the rope. I\u2019m not arguing with that \u2013 I\u2019m all for pacing after all, and appreciate some people need more rest than others \u2013 I can\u2019t pretend to be a savage on the sled pull by any means! However, I think sled pull is another area where you can push yourself a little more without compromising yourself too much for the rest of the race. Therefore, I am trying to be very conscious of having a bit of hustle at this station, minimising gaps between pulls of the rope.\n\n**#7. Learn the Order and Floor Plan **\n\nBefore I race, I make sure that the location of each workout zone, and the order in which I need to do them, is firmly imprinted in my mind. I don\u2019t want to be entering the Roxzone wondering whether I need to turn left or right to find the station I\u2019m heading to. It would mean wasted energy / time. So do your homework before the race and be able to visualise it in your mind.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I can\u2019t write this section without admitting one of my own errors. Before Birmingham 2022, I\u2019d fully memorised the layout and the order of stations. Yet when I was meant to be heading into the sled pull, I somehow managed to run back into the sled\n\n*push* station. It wasn\u2019t until I arrived at my sled that I realised my error! So even with the most intentional preparation mistakes can be made!\n\n**#8. Wall Ball Pacing**\n\nOh no he\u2019s going to talk about pacing again! Yes, I am! The wall balls are the last station. You\u2019re soooo close to the finish line. But that doesn\u2019t mean that you should max out. If you can\u2019t do all the 100/75 wall balls unbroken, then you need a strategy as to how many you\n\n*should *do in one go. If you start off by doing as many as you can (say you manage 40 unbroken) but that leaves your shoulders completely fried, and massively slows you down for the remainder, then you didn\u2019t pace appropriately. It\u2019s possible you should have just done 25 instead and had a very short pause, before carrying on. This is something to try and work out in training.\n\nHopefully this helps you for your next race.

          "snippet": "As I write this, in April 2022, Hunter McIntyre has just broken the HYROX world record in an incredible time of 55mins 09secs (update \u2013 he has since beaten that \u2013 you can see the list of up to date HYROX World Records here).\n\nAfter picking my jaw up off the floor at just how impressive this was, I started to wonder \u2013 considering all the data we have available to us \u2013 is there anything we can learn from the best of the best in the sport, other than just \u201cget fitter\u201d.\n\nIn the same way a non-league footballer might watch clips of Harry Kane to work out how he positions himself on the pitch, or a 28-handicap golfer might watch the type of shots Rory McIlroy plays around the green, all in an attempt to improve their performance, could there be anything that the average HYROX competitor might be able to pick up from the Elites of the competition?\n\nIs it just running they are primarily better at? Which of the functional exercises do they really excel at, and which are worthy our focus over and above some of the others? Are the Elites noticeably better on run 5 than run 8, or something along those lines?\n\nSo, I started to gather some data\u2026\n\n__The Method__\n\n__The Method__\n\nI\u2019ll say upfront, I\u2019m not a mathematician. There\u2019s a chance that any mathematicians reading this will have heart palpitations at just how flawed my methodology is. Maybe I should have used means instead of medians, or greater sample sizes. Maybe I lack statistical significance.\n\nI\u2019m also not at the Elite level in HYROX.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry as I\u2019m not going to be making any conclusions or giving any specific advice. If you want specific advice for your situation, check out our coaching options. Rather I\u2019ll just make some observations and raise some questions, that will hopefully help you in your own performance, training and race planning.\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s what I\u2019ve done\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve taken, from the HYROX leaderboard, 15 of the best HYROX performances ever \u2013 for both female and male at Pro level. I\u2019ve then taken the median of their times for each run and functional station. This group I\u2019m calling \u201c\n\n**Elite**\u201d.\n\nI repeated this for a sample of athletes who achieved a time broadly similar to what HYROX have said is the average time achieved at Pro level (roughly 90mins). This group I\u2019m calling \u201c\n\n**Average**\u201d.\n\nI\u2019ve deliberately avoided including any athlete more than once. For example, Hunter McIntyre has 5 of the top 10 times ever, at the time of writing, but I\u2019ve only included the fastest of those. I\u2019ve also avoided anyone who got a time penalty to avoid skewing the data.\n\n__The Findings__\n\n__The Findings__\n\nHere were the results\u2026\n\n|Men|Women|\n|--|--|\n|Elite|Average|Difference|Elite|Average|Difference|\n|Running 1|00:03:24|00:03:44|00:00:20|00:03:38|00:04:46|00:01:08|\n|Running 2|00:03:40|00:04:43|00:01:03|00:04:07|00:05:14|00:01:07|\n|Running 3|00:03:54|00:05:37|00:01:43|00:04:22|00:05:28|00:01:06|\n|Running 4|00:03:50|00:05:37|00:01:47|00:04:24|00:05:29|00:01:05|\n|Running 5|00:03:55|00:05:33|00:01:38|00:04:28|00:05:39|00:01:11|\n|Running 6|00:03:50|00:05:21|00:01:31|00:04:22|00:05:37|00:01:15|\n|Running 7|00:03:58|00:05:32|00:01:34|00:04:23|00:05:39|00:01:16|\n|Running 8|00:04:15|00:06:19|00:02:04|00:04:43|00:06:17|00:01:34|\n|Run Total|00:30:46|00:42:26|00:11:40|00:34:27|00:44:09|00:09:42|\n|1000m SkiErg|00:03:47|00:04:17|00:00:30|00:04:12|00:04:51|00:00:39|\n|2x25m Sled Push|00:02:45|00:03:40|00:00:55|00:03:00|00:03:48|00:00:47|\n|2x25m Sled Pull|00:03:14|00:06:31|00:03:17|00:03:54|00:06:36|00:02:42|\n|80m Burpee Broad Jump|00:02:21|00:05:15|00:02:54|00:03:11|00:04:53|00:01:42|\n|1000m Row|00:03:58|00:04:35|00:00:37|00:04:29|00:05:12|00:00:43|\n|200m Farmers Carry|00:01:37|00:02:32|00:00:55|00:01:57|00:02:45|00:00:48|\n|100m Sandbag Lunges|00:03:03|00:05:22|00:02:19|00:03:35|00:05:25|00:01:50|\n|Wall Balls|00:04:25|00:07:38|00:03:13|00:03:50|00:06:20|00:02:30|\n|Roxzone Time|00:02:54|00:06:58|00:04:04|00:03:47|00:06:12|00:02:25|\n|Total|00:58:50|01:29:14|00:30:24|01:06:22|01:30:11|00:23:49|\nYou can draw your own conclusions from that data if you wish but here\u2019s some of what I thought were potentially the most useful findings\u2026\n\n__Running__\n\n__Running__\n\nRunning is a large part of HYROX (it takes up 52% of the average elite race) and, surprise surprise, the Elites are better at running than the Average. Over the 8km in a HYROX race the men are nearly 12mins quicker and women nearly 10 mins quicker. Most people will have expected this, so I won\u2019t dwell on advising you just to become a faster runner. But it is, of course, important.\n\nI do, however, think it\u2019s worth pointing out that the Elites sampled run at an average pace of 3.51mins/km (men), or 4.18mins/km (women). I feel almost embarrassed to say this as I\u2019m nowhere near the standard of these athletes, but it is a running pace that I personally can get my head around. It\n\n*feels* achievable to do that (at least if I just look at the running portion in isolation).\n\nWhen Eliud Kipchoge ran a marathon in under 2 hours, his average splits were a pace of 2.51mins per km \u2013 for the length of a marathon. That I simply can\u2019t get my head around. But the Elites running pace in HYROX I (perhaps deludedly) can.\n\nIf we look at it in the context of world records for the Marathon, Half Marathon, and half distance Ironman (where the running portion is a half marathon, after a 1.9km swim and 90km bike ride), you can see the running split times are longer in HYROX, despite it being a shorter event\u2026\n\nOf course, that may not be a completely fair comparison. They are different events, HYROX has not been going for a long time (and we may eventually see much quicker running splits), and I\u2019m comparing World Records with an average of 15 Elite HYROX competitors. But I still think it has some relevance. And what I\u2019m really trying to stress is that you can still be very good at HYROX without being one of the world\u2019s best runners \u2013 there is more than just running for you to think about.\n\n**I suspect though that the Elite HYROX athletes are world class at compromised running.** To run that pace consistently through the race, after all the functional exercises, is very impressive. I wonder if Kipchoge could do that. Or even if Kipchoge could have got to the end of the race. Maybe he\u2019d have had to bail out at the sled push?! Who knows.\n\n**To summarise from a running perspective, improving your running is likely important if you want to move yourself closer to the Elite HYROX standard. But I don\u2019t think you need to be world class at running to be world class at HYROX. You do, however, need to be very good at compromised running, and have the endurance to sustain a solid running pace over an event that lasts 54mins+. In this article we talk more about compromised running and how to train for it.**\n\n__Pacing__\n\n__Pacing__\n\nIt feels to me as if the Elites may be better at pacing themselves than the average athlete, especially on the first run. This is certainly the case if we just look at the men \u2013 women don\u2019t seem to suffer so much with this problem.\n\nYou can see that the blue line is much flatter for the Elite men, indicating their run times are more consistent across the race. The first 1km run for the Average men (orange line), in particular, is much quicker than their average splits.\n\n** What impact could this be having on the rest of their race? Should they be conserving their energy better? **\n\nThe fact that women seem to be better at pacing themselves than men is no surprise. This study showed that women were 18.33% better than men at keeping an even pace in a marathon.\n\nIs pacing even important? In an event as long as HYROX, almost certainly. The consensus seems to be that for longer events (such as HYROX) not starting out too quickly is a sensible decision. For shorter distances, a faster start (to an extent) can be ok, but as most competitors are taking 60mins+ for HYROX, it is likely you want to be holding yourself back a little on the first couple of runs.\n\n**Could this be why the Average woman is much closer in time to an Elite Woman (23mins 49secs in our data), than an Average Man is to an Elite Man (30mins 24secs)? Click here to read our article on how to appropriately pace the running at HYROX. **\n\n__Ski Pace__\n\n__Ski Pace__\n\nIt\u2019s harder to gauge but I suspect the men are going a touch too quick on the SkiErg too, relative to their overall ability. The SkiErg has the smallest difference in times between Elite and Average competitors. This might be expected. However, as we know the men are almost certainly starting out too quickly on their first run, it\u2019s quite possible this is carrying over to the Ski as well (which is the first of the functional stations).\n\nThe men are 30 seconds slower on the Ski, and women are 39 secs slower. I know personally if I go maybe 5 secs/500m slower on the SkiErg, it significantly lowers my heart rate, even though that only equates to 10 seconds slower over 1km.\n\nIf you are able, I would suggest experimenting with your ski split times in training, and see how much better you feel if you go a little slower than you\u2019re planning to for your next race. What impact does an extra, say, 10 seconds on your 1km time do for your heart rate and how you feel afterwards? 10 seconds in the context of a HYROX, is a pretty small number, and could save you a greater amount of time in the remainder of the race.\n\n__Sled Push / Sled Pull__\n\n__Sled Push / Sled Pull__\n\nThe sled-based events at HYROX are the 2 main areas that benefit from an athlete\u2019s strength. So, you might expect the difference in times between the Average and Elite to be broadly similar on both the sled push and sled pull. But it\u2019s not. Average men are 55secs slower on push, and a whopping 3.17mins slower on the pull. The women are 47secs slower on push, and 2.42mins slower on the pull.\n\nLooked at another way, Elite men spend 18% longer on sled pull than their sled push, and Elite women spend 30% longer. But the Average spend 78% (men) or 74% (women) longer on the pull than the push!\n\nAs I see it, there are a few things to think about here:\n\n\u2013 Are Average athletes pushing too hard on the sled push, relative to their strength levels? And if so, could that be screwing them up for the rest of the race?\n\n\u2013 Or are the Average just much worse at the sled pull? In which case, working on technique, pull strength and posterior chain is very important.\n\n**For most people reading this, what the Average athlete is doing doesn\u2019t really matter. But could something similar be happening in your performance? Is your sled pull to sled push ratio similar to that of an Elite athlete? If not, could you be pushing too hard on the sled pull, or neglecting the work needed to improve your sled pull times?**\n\n__Roxzone__\n\n__Roxzone__\n\nAs hesitant as I\u2019ve been to give advice in this article, I will now break that and say one thing; If you want a good time, don\u2019t f*** about in the Roxzone!\n\nThe difference between the Elites and Averages in time spent in the Roxzone is quite startling. Average men spend 4.04mins longer in there, and Average women 2mins 25secs. That seems far too long.\n\nThe size of the Roxzone does vary by venue but I would roughly estimate it to be 800m on average. Therefore, it\u2019s a reasonable expectation for your Roxzone time to broadly be 80% of your average 1km split times. For Elites the data shows 75% (men) and 88% (Women). But for Average athletes it is 131% (men) and 112% (women)!\n\nThe Roxzone was certainly a bigger area than I\u2019d been expecting prior to my first event. Personally speaking, I suspect I subconsciously started to relax a little after each run as soon as I entered the Roxzone. It wasn\u2019t a conscious thing, but my Roxzone time of 6 minutes in my first race suggests that it was happening. That is something that the Elites never do. They stop running as soon as they are about to start the next exercise. And as soon as they\u2019ve finished it, they start again. Roxzone or running track are treated the same; for running on.\n\nOne enticing thing about the Roxzone is the drinks provided there. In a hot HYROX race it becomes very tempting to stop at the water table and sip on a cool drink before setting off again. The Elites may grab a water on the way past, but I doubt they are stopping for a relaxing beverage and a chat.\n\nTo be fair, as the Elites complete the race in a faster time, they have less need to take on as much water, so that may be a factor here, but it can\u2019t explain the difference entirely.\n\n**If you\u2019ve entered a HYROX in the past, have you spent too long in the Roxzone? How could you speed that up? Does the time you spent in the zone reasonably compare to how quickly you might run 800m(ish)? **\n\nGoing forward, I plan to think of the Roxzone as just another functional exercise but one I want to win. Rather than relax as I enter the Roxzone, its game on. In fact, as I write this, I\u2019m wondering if in I\u2019ll have a game of \u201cfloor is lava\u201d with myself where I imagine the floor in the Roxzone is lava and I have to get out of there as quickly as I can. Of course, it may mean I end up doing the runs or functional stations slower, but it\u2019s worth a go!\n\n__Summary__\n\n__Summary__\n\nThe data I\u2019ve gathered does show that Elites are better than the Average at\n\n__all__ the stations, and __all __the runs. That\u2019s probably to be expected. All areas are important in improving your times.\n\nAside from what\u2019s already been mentioned above, there is a particularly large difference in times on the Wall Balls and Burpee Broad Jumps, meaning these should likely be prioritised, for most people, over and above working on SkiErg and Rowing, for example (where the differences are much smaller).\n\nIt will obviously be different for each person, as we all have our own strengths and weaknesses, but to summarise where I think some of the\n\n*lowest hanging fruit* is in bringing an Average athlete closer to Elite level it would be:\n\n\u2013 Working on compromised running\n\n\u2013 Improved pacing (men especially)\n\n\u2013 Improved performance on the sled pull (with an aim to get your sled pull to sled push ratio more closely aligned with that of the Elites)\n\n\u2013 Reduced time in the Roxzone (bringing your Roxzone time to somewhere around 75-90% of your average 1km running time across the event)\n\nIf you\u2019d like any help with your performances in HYROX, we can\u2019t promise to make you Elite but we\u2019ll do our best to maximise your potential.

          "snippet": "Understanding the best way to approach the running sections of a HYROX race is not easy. HYROX is very different to pacing something such a normal 5km / 10km running race, for example. In those you are only running, and will likely have a reasonably good idea of how fast you can go from your training sessions. But in a HYROX you have all the functional exercises in-between the runs. This can have a significant impact on your running capabilities.\n\nGo too quick with your runs, and you\u2019ll end up making it harder than it needs to be, suffering later on, and potentially having to walk aspects of the race. Go too slow, and your overall time will suffer (as running is approximately 50% of the race). Getting your pace just right is, therefore, critical.\n\nIn this article, I\u2019ll take you through what I\u2019ve learned about pacing a HYROX, from personal experience, helping our coaching clients, and from diving into the data.\n\n**Keep It Consistent**\n\nIn our \u201cAverage to Elite\u201d article, we highlighted that the best performers in HYROX appeared to pace their runs more consistently than those who achieved an average HYROX time (which is about 90mins). This was particularly the case for the men. That perhaps shouldn\u2019t be a surprise as a study has shown that women were 18.33% better than men at keeping an even pace in a marathon.\n\nOne thing to appreciate in HYROX is that the 1st run, and the last run, in some instances, can be different in length to the other 6 runs. With the first run you need to take into account that the \u201cStart\u201d is in a slightly different place to the \u201cOut\u201d of the Roxzone. This makes the first run shorter, or longer, than subsequent runs. What\u2019s more, the final run is often longer because you need to make it to the Wall Ball station. That can be a reasonably long journey at most HYROX venues. I\u2019d previously assumed this \u2018journey\u2019 was added on to your Roxzone time, as opposed to your run time, but that\u2019s not the case \u2013 it goes on to your run time.\n\nTherefore, when all is considered, it\u2019s really only appropriate to assess runs 2-7 for consistency of pacing.\n\n**2022 HYROX World Championships Running Pace**\n\nUnderstanding this, I decided to take another look at the data. This time I used the 2022 HYROX World Championships in Las Vegas as the starting point.\n\nI took the median run times for the following 3 groups of HYROX athletes:\n\n\u2013 the top 5 Elite race finishers\n\n\u2013 the remainder of the Elite race finishers\n\n\u2013 a sample of athletes competing in the Pro division, on the same day, who achieved around the average finisher time (approximately 85mins)\n\nI then looked at the average differences, for the athletes in these groups, between their fastest 1km run and their slowest 1km run (for runs 2 to 7 only).\n\nHere\u2019s what the graph showed\u2026\n\n**We can see that the top 5 finishers in the Elite race ran much more consistent time splits, on average, than the remainder of the Elite racers. And the average Pro competitors ran much less consistent splits than the Elite racers.**\n\n**Going Out Hot?**\n\nSo that\u2019s runs 2 to 7 analysed. But how about the first run? Anyone who has taken part in a HYROX will know how tempting it is to go out quickly from the start, spurred on by the adrenaline of the race, as well as the fact that everyone else around you seems to also be starting quickly!\n\nIn Las Vegas, the first run was substantially shorter than subsequent runs. So, I looked to see if we could work out if going out too fast was affecting someone\u2019s overall time\u2026\n\nThe graph shows the top 5 Elite finishers spent a\n\n**longer** amount of time on their first run than the rest of the Elite field, relative to their average overall run time. Basically, **they went out a touch slower, relative to their overall running split times, than the rest of the Elites, who in turn went out slower than the average Pro athletes.** Put another way, the athletes with the slower overall times, seem to be going out relatively faster on the first run.\n\n*I should just quickly add here that I am only looking at the World Championships data here. All of the athletes at the World Championships are amazing. They have earned the right to be there and are very good, and likely experienced, at HYROX. This data simply shows that the best of the best appeared to pace their runs more consistently, and went out relatively slower on the first run. My guess is that an average athlete at a non-World Championship event would show an even greater amount of variability in their runs, and would likely go out much faster on their first run. *\n\n**But is it Important?**\n\nIt seems to be reasonably clear, at the HYROX World Championships at least, the fastest competitors paced their runs more consistently than the rest of the field. And they don\u2019t go out as quick (relatively speaking) on the first run either. Of course, we can\u2019t know with any certainty whether that is playing a part in their superior finishing position. However, we can look elsewhere for some clues\u2026\n\n**Kipchoge 2 Hour Marathon**\n\nWhere better to start than one of the greatest running performances of all time? On 12th October 2019, 34-year-old Eliud Kipchoge ran a marathon in under 2 hours. His time of 1:59:40, was set in Vienna and is the fastest any runner has ever covered 26.2 miles. The event had been specifically put on with this goal in mind, and no stone was left unturned in helping to facilitate the incredible feat. As part of that, Kipchoge ran behind a group of pacemakers, and a pace setting car, throughout the race. This meant that every single 1km split time for the whole marathon was between 2:48ins/km and 2:52mins/km. It feels reasonably safe to say if such consistent pacing was not optimal, then Kipchoge and his team would not have gone to such great lengths to achieve it.\n\n**Half Marathon World Record**\n\nBut a marathon is, roughly speaking, twice the length of time of the HYROX world record. Maybe pacing a marathon is more important because it\u2019s longer?\n\nSo, let\u2019s look at the half-marathon world records. At the time of writing, the men\u2019s half marathon WR is held by Uganda\u2019s Jacob Kiplimo, with a time of 57:31. This is much more aligned with a HYROX elite athlete race time.\n\nI don\u2019t have the precise 1km split times for his whole race. However, we can see that for the first 5km he averaged 2:44mins/km, for the next 5km he averaged 2:41mins/km, the next 5km was 2:40mins/km, and the remainder of the race he averaged 2:48mins/km. Not quite as consistent as Kipchoge\u2019s marathon but still incredibly consistent.\n\nThe women\u2019s half marathon WR is held by Ethiopia\u2019s Letesenbet Gidey with a time of 1:02:52. For the first 5km she averaged 3:00mins/km, for the next 5km she averaged 2:57mins/km, the next 5km was 2:57mins/km, and the remainder of the race she averaged 3:01mins/km. Again, very consistent!\n\n**Why is Pacing so Important?**\n\nIf it is the case that consistent pacing is important, and that does appear to be the case, why is that?\n\nThe fact is that if you go out too fast you will more quickly build up lactic acid in the body, use up glycogen stores much sooner, and increase your core temperature too soon.\n\nOver shorter distances / race times, this can be manageable (within reason). But when you are talking about something as long as a HYROX it just makes the latter stages of the race too hard, and you slow too much.\n\nEssentially, you want to just push to the point where you aren\u2019t excessively fatiguing yourself for the latter stages of the race. It\u2019s a difficult thing to manage \u2013 and it comes with training sessions designed with that purpose in mind, as well as experience of the HYROX events themselves.\n\nConsistent pacing will almost certainly mean deliberately slowing yourself towards the start of the race. You will likely feel like you could be going faster (and many athletes around you\n\n*will* be going faster). This can be mentally challenging. However, it is better to slow yourself down deliberately at the start, than be forced to slow down towards the end (or sooner!)\n\n**How Can I Pace Myself at HYROX?**\n\nWithout practice, research has shown that recreational runners incorrectly estimate their pace by 32 to 40 seconds per mile. Accurate, consistent pacing isn\u2019t something you want to leave to chance on race day! Fortunately, there are steps you can take to help \u2026\n\n**Use Your Watch**\n\nThe most effective way I\u2019ve found to pace myself at HYROX is by using the lap functionality on my watch. As I leave the Roxzone, I hit the lap timer button. I then keep a close eye on my time so that I enter the Roxzone again at a\n\n**pre-determined** running split time. This also helps to minimise the chances of the surprisingly common mistake of running too many (or too few) laps of the track.\n\nI\u2019ll also know how my target time translates to the amount of time I need to run\n\n**per lap** of the track. I use the venue floor plan to help do this in the days prior to the race. Let\u2019s say that 1km is 2.5 laps of the track. If I want to hit a running split of 4:30mins/km, it means I need to run 1 lap of the track in about 1:48mins. So, from the moment I leave the Roxzone, to the first time I pass the Roxzone exit, I\u2019ll be aiming to do it in roughly 1:48mins. This is something I will be keeping an eye on during my runs.\n\nThe watch I personally use is the Polar Vantage M2, but many watches will have a lap functionality that would be suitable.\n\n**First Run**\n\nYou also need to consider that the first run can be shorter, or longer, depending on where the Start line is. I will calculate, in advance, how long I want that first run to take. If I estimate the first run to be 100meters shorter, for example, then I\u2019d be looking for my first run to be 90% of my normal running split times. If my 1km time aim is 4:30mins, then that first run at 90%, would be 4:03mins.\n\n**Practice in Training**\n\nI appreciate I am a bit of a numbers geek. Some of this stuff (like working out time per lap, etc) may come more naturally to me than others. I do, though, think it\u2019s a very important, and highly underappreciated, aspect to HYROX. Therefore, it is something that should be practiced in your training sessions. You could literally run some 1km intervals at race pace (perhaps at the athletics track), both with the use of your watch and its lap timing functionality, and on occasions without a watch (in an attempt to get used to proper pacing by feel alone).\n\n**How Do I Know What Pace to Go Though?!**\n\nDetermining your appropriate race pace can largely come down to experience. If you\u2019ve competed in HYROX before you\u2019ll know your total running time. That can be used as a starting point for working out how fast you want to run next time (taking into account any improvements you\u2019ve made since then). Everyone is different so it\u2019s hard for me to give any specific direction as to how fast you should be running. But I\u2019ll try\u2026\n\n**Running Race Paces**\n\nFirstly, if you haven\u2019t done a HYROX before, I wouldn\u2019t expect your 1km running splits to be aligned with your 5km pace. It will almost certainly be slower than that. It will also likely be slower than your 10km running pace. I\u2019m sure there are people who do run at their 10km pace, but in my experience that\u2019s not common. It will likely be more aligned with your half marathon, or even marathon, pace. I know that\u2019s not hugely prescriptive but hopefully it gives you a ballpark pace to be thinking about. If you\u2019ve not run a half or full marathon before, then this race time predictor can provide a rough estimate of your time based on any shorter runs that you\u2019ve done. Again, its rough, but gives a bit of a guide to be thinking about.\n\n**How Long Does it Take to Run 1km?**\n\nHow long it takes to run 1km, on average, is of course a question that many people entering HYROX for the first time will have. The reality is, it depends on a huge number of factors. The fastest in HYROX will run 1km as quick as 3:30m, sometimes even faster. The average though are slower than that. In the Mens Open (generally the most well attended division), the average time per km is just over 5 minutes.\n\n**Heart Rate Test**\n\nOne test I periodically perform to help determine my pace is to run 1km at 155bpm (which is around 85% of my max heart rate).\n\nTo do this I will start to run (on an athletics track) and steadily bring my heart rate up to that level. Then I\u2019ll hit the start timer on my watch, and time how long it takes me to run 1km whilst maintaining my heart rate at an average of 155bpm. You may need to adjust your HR target depending on your age, max heart rate, and how comfortable you feel over extended periods of time at certain heart rates. I have found that the time I take to do this is, roughly speaking, a good pace for me to aim for at HYROX.\n\nIt certainly might not be appropriate for everyone, but it\u2019s good for me. It\u2019s also a reasonably pure way of tracking your running progress as it takes out any pacing experience, trying harder, or anything like that \u2013 it\u2019s all just driven by your heart rate. That said, there are obviously factors that can affect the result such as levels of fatigue, the temperature, etc. So I consider it a rough guide. I ensure I use my\n\n**heart rate strap** for this test as it provides a much great level of accuracy than a heart rate watch does.\n\n**Training Practice**\n\nAside from the above, the best way to determine an appropriate pace is by experimenting in training. This is where a full HYROX run through / simulation can come in handy. To find out what might be considered a good running pace in HYROX check out this article.\n\n**Summary**\n\nBetween my first HYROX and my third, I improved my time by 12 minutes. I attribute a fair portion of the improvement to more appropriately pacing my race. I think it\u2019s a hugely underappreciated aspect to HYROX that can have a real impact on your overall performance. It\u2019s not necessarily an easy thing to do, which is why it\u2019s important to work on in your training sessions.\n\nIf you need more help with all of this, as well as training for the event, and planning your nutrition, check out our coaching plans, where we give you all the tools you need to maximise your potential in HYROX.\n\n",

          "snippet": "HYROX arenas are a sweaty battleground of sled pushes, burpees and athletes who seem to have a t-shirt allergy \ud83d\ude1c In all seriousness, the high intensity effort required to complete a HYROX means it\u2019s vital that you go into your races with a fuel and hydration strategy that\u2019ll help you maintain your performance.\n\nSo, it\u2019s no surprise that a growing number of HYROX competitors are reaching out to our Athlete Support Team for guidance on how to approach fueling their competitions\u2026\n\n### Do you really need to fuel and hydrate a HYROX?\n\nFor the uninitiated, HYROX is a unique blend of endurance and strength, featuring eight rounds that each consist of a one-kilometre run followed by a functional workout station. Finish times range from ~55 minutes for the elites to around three hours for those grinding it out, with the \u2018average competitor\u2019 clocking in at just under 90 minutes.\n\nMel, from our Athlete Support Team, completed a HYROX race in 70 minutes and her average heart rate was 154bpm, which is ~96% of her maximum heart rate of 161bpm. That kind of sustained effort is comparable to running a half marathon or smashing out a sprint-distance triathlon, where glycogen stores are key to performance.\n\nThe constant switch between running and high-intensity efforts forces your body to toggle between aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, making carbohydrate availability crucial. Once your glycogen stores run low, fatigue kicks in, power output drops, and suddenly the rowing station starts to feel like a\n\n*very* long grind...\n\n*Image Credit: Strive \u00a9*\n\nAs well as burning through your glycogen stores, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019re going to be sweating a lot through those high intensity efforts. Inadequate fluid and sodium intake can result in progressive dehydration, leading to increased plasma osmolality, reduced blood volume, and impaired thermoregulation. This in turn can cause muscle cramping, decreased neuromuscular function, and cognitive decline.\n\nSo, replacing an adequate proportion of the fluid you lose through sweat (and the sodium you lose in that sweat) is very important to sustain your performance.\n\nBut before we consider how to approach fueling and hydration\n\n*during* a HYROX, it\u2019s important to ensure you get to the start line in optimal condition\u2026\n\n### How to START your HYROX fueled\n\nStarting well-fueled is critical - providing your body with the energy it needs to sustain the hard efforts and delay fatigue. When fully stocked, your body can store ~500g of glucose as glycogen in your muscles, and ~100g in your liver, which is enough to fuel moderate to high-intensity exercise for ~60-90 minutes.\n\nSo, for most HYROX competitors, your glycogen stores serve as your primary energy source. If your glycogen levels are running low to begin with, fatigue will creep in, your strength and power output will be limited and your recovery between stations slowed down. Research shows that starting with \u201cfull\u201d glycogen stores helps delay these issues so you can maintain a higher intensity across the entire event.\n\n**How to fuel the day before your event:**\n\nOn a regular day, most people consume around 3-6 grams of carbohydrate per kilogram of body weight. However, for an event like HYROX, a more structured approach to carb-loading could be beneficial - especially if you expect to race for over two hours.\n\nFor most athletes, aiming for a minimum of 8g of carbohydrate per kg of body weight in the 24 hours leading up to the event helps ensure your muscle and liver glycogen stores are fully \u2018stocked\u2019.\n\n**How to fuel race morning:**\n\nA high-carb meal a few hours before your race helps maximise glycogen stores and ensures you start well-fueled. When it comes to pre-race food choices, stick to familiar, high-carb, low-fibre, and low-fat foods in the days leading up to and on race day to minimise the risk of GI discomfort.\n\nSince the start time of HYROX competitions varies, the best approach is to work backwards from your start time to plan your pre-race nutrition:\n\n**T- 2-3 hours**: High-carb, low-fibre meal (e.g., toast, rice, porridge) **T- 1-2 hours**: Carb-rich snack (e.g., 1-2 x PF 30 Chew, energy bar, rice) **T- 30 minutes**: Another carb-rich snack (e.g., PF 30 Caffeine Gel, PF 30 Chew, energy bar, banana)\n\nThis approach helps ensure you hit the start line feeling primed, rather than running on fumes by station three.\n\n### How to START your HYROX hydrated\n\nMany athletes unknowingly start events dehydrated, which can negatively affect both performance and perceived effort. A 2019 review found that 40-50% of recreationally active individuals begin exercise in a mildly dehydrated state. To optimise hydration, try preloading with a strong electrolyte drink like PH 1500.\n\nTest out this preloading protocol before your longer and sweatier training sessions, so you\u2019re confident of implementing it on race day:\n\n**The night before**: Drink 1 x PH 1500 tablet or packet with ~500ml (~16oz) of water **90 minutes before** **exercise**: Drink 1 x PH 1500 tablet or packet with ~500ml (~16oz) of water to ensure you start fully hydrated\n\nElectrolytes - especially sodium - play an important role in fluid balance, muscle function, and preventing cramping. Preloading increases plasma volume, which gives you a hydration \u2018buffer\u2019 so you can sweat from a larger 'pool' of fluid, tolerate more sweat loss before performance suffers, and sustain performance for longer..\n\n### Should you eat and drink DURING a HYROX?\n\nGiven HYROX events typically last between 1-3 hours, a strategic approach to your carb intake can help maintain your energy levels by delaying glycogen depletion.\n\n**Fuel Tips:**\n\n- If you\u2019re racing for less than 75 minutes, carry some carb-rich gels or chews for quick energy boosts during the run or less intense moments. These can help top up energy levels without disrupting your rhythm\n\n- Given that HYROX involves high-intensity strength and endurance efforts over an extended period, effectively training your gut to tolerate carbs is crucial. Optimising the gastrointestinal system\u2019s ability to absorb and utilise fuel and fluids efficiently can help maintain hydration, sustain energy levels, and reduce the risk of gut distress. This ensures you can perform at high intensity without the discomfort or performance decline associated with poor nutrient absorption or dehydration\n\n- You may want to consider using caffeine as 3-6mg of caffeine per kilo of body weight has been scientifically proven to enhance performance by reducing perceived effort and delaying fatigue. Given that caffeine has a half life of ~4-5 hours, it\u2019s likely that a cup of coffee or caffeine hit via other means around an hour\n\n*before*your HYROX could give you that extra boost - especially for later start times, when tiredness from the day may already be kicking in\n\n*Image Credit: F45 training \u00a9*\n\n**Hydration Tips:**\n\nWith limited opportunities to grab fluids (and the risk of turning the arena into a slip 'n slide if you have a particularly high sweat rate), starting well-hydrated is your best bet.\n\n- Studies have shown that more than a 2% loss of body weight from dehydration can reduce power output and impair cognitive function\n\n- Where possible, sip water at the aid stations in the Rox Zone to manage thirst and minimise fluid loss\n\n- Carrying a soft flask in your pocket or belt with some electrolytes can help maintain hydration and replenish sodium lost through heavy sweating (plus it\u2019s easy to discard when empty)\n\n##### How to fuel different race durations\n\n**Race duration: <75 minutes**\n\n- Focus on pre-event fueling to carry you through\n\n- Eat a caffeine gel or chew in the final 30 minutes before your competition starts\n\n- Carry an additional gel for a mid-race boost\n\n- Sip water from aid stations if needed\n\n**Race duration: 75 minutes \u2013 2 hours**\n\n- Eat a caffeine gel or chew in the last 30 minutes before the start\n\n- Aim for 30\u201360g of carbs per hour using gels or chews\n\n- Take them during easier sections or rest periods to avoid GI discomfort\n\n- Carry a 500ml (16oz) soft flask of electrolytes to stay hydrated and replace lost sodium\n\n**Race duration: >2 hours**\n\n- Eat a caffeine gel or chew in the last 30 minutes before the start\n\n- Aim for 30\u201360g of carbs per hour to prevent energy dips from glycogen depletion\n\n- Carry a 500ml (16oz) soft flask of electrolytes to stay hydrated and replace lost sodium\n\n- Take on additional fluid from aid stations as needed, particularly in humid environments\n\nBy fine-tuning your fuel and hydration strategy, you\u2019ll keep your energy levels high, your power output steady, and your burpees looking (relatively) strong all the way to the finish.\n\n### Post-HYROX recovery\n\nAs tempting as it can be after a HYROX, recovery isn\u2019t just about lying on the floor. A proactive approach to refueling and rehydrating can have a positive impact on how you\u2019re able to bounce back from an event\u2026\n\n**Fuel: Rebuild and Replenish**\n\nRefueling quickly will help repair damaged muscles and replenish your energy stores. A mix of simple carbohydrates, like glucose and fructose, helps restore both muscle and liver glycogen more efficiently. Delaying carbohydrate intake can negatively impact both recovery and subsequent performance, so don\u2019t wait too long before getting food in.\n\n- Research suggests that muscle damage from eccentric exercise (like those lung-burning sled pulls and wall balls) can impair muscle glycogen replenishment\n\n- To counter this, aim for a high-carb meal with some protein soon after finishing (~60-80g of carbs and ~20-30g of protein)\n\n- Continue prioritising carbs throughout the day and in the next 24 hours to optimise recovery\n\nIf you plan to train again soon, planning a more aggressive refueling strategy will help replace glycogen stores rapidly.\n\n**Hydration: Replace What You Lost**\n\nMost athletes finish HYROX dehydrated. PF&H COO, Jonny Tye carried out some sweat rate testing during his race simulation sessions and found that he loses 2-2.5L of sweat per hour. So, you\u2019re basically leaving a small puddle of yourself behind. Replacing lost fluids with electrolytes, not just water, is key to recovering properly.\n\n- High sweat rates are common in high-intensity events like HYROX, making rehydration with sodium crucial\n\n- If you\u2019re training again soon or have another race coming up, a more aggressive rehydration strategy is needed\n\n- In these cases, drinking PH 1500 within 30-60 minutes post-HYROX will aid fluid retention, restore electrolyte balance, and help you recover faster\n\n*Image Credit: The Revolution Gym, Ringwood*\n\nFinally, to give you an insight into how different athletes have fueled and hydrated their HYROX races, I\u2019ve shared some case studies:\n\nIf you need help tailoring your plan for your HYROX race, you can book a free one-to-one video call with one of our team, or drop us an email at hello@fandh.com.\n\n",

The Step Forward**\n\n- Drive knee forward and up (hip flexor engagement)\n\n- Aim for 0.9-1.1m step length\n\n- Land on midfoot, not heel\n\n- Keep torso vertical (prevents forward lean that loads quads more)\n\n**2. The Descent**\n\n\u2026\n\n**Workout F - Station Sequence:**\n\n- Farmers carry: 200m (race weight)\n\n- \u2192 Immediately: Sandbag lunges 100m\n\n- \u2192 Immediately: Wall balls 100 reps\n\n- Full race sequence, no rest between stations\n\nFrequency: Week 5 (2 workouts), Week 6 (1 workout - taper)\n\n\u2026\n\n## Race Day Execution\n\n### Pre-Station (During Farmers Carry & Transition)\n\n- Shake out quads during farmers walk\n\n- Mental prep: \"Attack this, quads recover during the run\"\n\n- Position sandbag high on traps, secure grip\n\n### During Station\n\n- First 10 steps: Establish rhythm, find line\n\n- Middle 70 steps: Lock into autopilot, controlled aggression\n\n- Final 20 steps: Push pace, finish strong\n\n- Breathing: Exhale on drive up, inhale at bottom\n\n\u2026\n\n### During Farmers Carry (Station 6)\n\n- Shake out quads during walk (dynamic muscle relaxation)\n\n- Spot the lunge course - identify centerline to follow\n\n- Mental prep: \"Next station is my time to gain\"\n\n### RoxZone (Farmers \u2192 Lunges)\n\n- Position sandbag HIGH on traps, NOT low on shoulders\n\n- Secure grip on bag, adjust before starting\n\n- One deep breath, commit to aggression\n\n### During Lunges (100m)\n\n- First 3 steps: Establish line, rhythm, and step length\n\n- Steps 4-90: Lock into autopilot, trust technique\n\n- Final 10 steps: Push pace, smell wall balls\n\n- Constant movement - touch and go on back knee\n\n### Post-Lunges RoxZone\n\n- Don't panic about leg fatigue (it's normal, won't affect run)\n\n- Walk purposefully to wall balls\n\n- Remind yourself: quads preserved by posterior-chain emphasis\n\n- Wall balls first 20 reps will feel hard - push through",

          "snippet": "Burpee Broad Jumps (BBJ) is the fourth station in a HYROX event. You need to complete 80meters of BBJs in total during the race.\n\nBy the time you start these, you will have already run 4km and have completed 3 functional stations (SkiErg, sled push, sled pull). Following the BBJs, you have rowing, farmers carries, sandbag lunges and the wall balls station left to complete, with a 1km run in between each station.\n\nBelow is a video (from HYROX) outlining the burpee broad jumps and some training tips\u2026\n\n**HYROX Burpee Broad Jump Standards**\n\nYou must start the BBJ station from the bottom position, chest to floor, with your hands behind the line.\n\nWhen standing back up, the feet cannot pass the previous position of where your hands were placed. You may step back up, or leap back up with both feet at the same time (most, not all, athletes tend to prefer to step up).\n\nFeet must be parallel on take off and landing \u2013 no staggered take offs.\n\nDuring each BBJ your chest must touch the ground in the lower position.\n\nYou may not take any steps forward between reps.\n\nWhen placing your hands on the floor, they must be placed no more than 30cm in front of your feet.\n\nAny violations will lead to a warning. 2 warnings lead to a 15 second time penalty. For more information on the rules and movement standards, please familiarise yourself with rulebook for your event.\n\n**HYROX Burpee Broad Jump Standards**\n\nIn the below video, Rox Lyfe coach Paul Gillingham looks at 2 different techniques for the Burpee Broad Jump movement\u2026\n\n**HYROX Burpee Broad Jump Tips**\n\nBurpee Broad Jumps are an all over body workout, and differs from a traditional burpee as you need to jump forwards with each rep. For most people, they can be very tough and spike your heart rate, especially if you don\u2019t pace them appropriately.\n\nYou want to ideally, if possible, aim for solid consistent pacing throughout the station (as opposed to going really fast for a while, then having to take long breaks while you catch your breath). To help do this, most people benefit from not taking excessively long jumps with each rep; that might seem like the way to get the distance covered as quickly as possible, but it can be very taxing on your legs and heart.\n\nIf you do need to rest while performing the exercise I personally prefer to rest lying on the floor, as opposed to in a standing up position. There will be an element of personal preference with that (so test both options out yourself) but I feel that my heart rate lowers more quickly if I\u2019m lying down than when standing up.\n\nMost people will tend to prefer to step up from the bottom of the burpee, one leg at a time, as opposed to jumping up with both legs together. The latter approach would be quicker if you were able to do it consistently for the full 80 meters, but it does tend to hike your heart rate up a lot more and most of the top athletes will use the step up method.\n\nIf you need any help with training for your next race, check out our personalised coaching options, or our Individual or Doubles 12 week training plan.\n\n",

          "snippet": "## How to Warm Up for Hyrox Race Day (Without Burning Out Before the Start Line)\n\nYour Hyrox race day is here and you\u2019re wondering how to warm up without totally toasting your legs before the race even begins. If that sounds like you, keep reading\u2014I\u2019m going to walk you through my efficient, effective, and \u201cnot overdoing it\u201d Hyrox race prep warm-up.\n\n**The Problem:** So many people do way too much and end up burning themselves out before they even get to the starting line. That\u2019s the last thing you want. But you **do** want to get in, get warm, get moving, and get ready for the day ahead.\n\n### Arrive Early and Use the Warm-Up Area Strategically\n\nI find the warm-up area is really helpful for distancing yourself from the crowd and the chaos. Don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t go in there early to help you zen in for the race.\n\nMake sure you have enough time to warm up, get some water, use the restroom, and feel confident and prepared before that 10-minute wait in the starting tunnel begins.\n\n**Key Point:** You don\u2019t need a full 30 or 60-minute workout before you race. You still want to follow the key principles of any warm-up, just scaled appropriately for race day.\n\nI\u2019m going to give you a structure to follow, but recognize you can adjust this to your needs\u2014underlying injuries, movements you want to feel confident about, or things you haven\u2019t touched much in training.\n\n### Step 1: Elevate Your Core Temperature\n\nWith any warm-up, the first goal is getting your body warm. Elevate your core temperature, get blood flowing, and prepare for the activity ahead.\n\nA great way to do this is hopping on the rower or SkiErg in the Hyrox warm-up area. Go through a few minutes of easy, light rowing to dial in your form\u2014or get on the skier to practice that motion.\n\nThis is especially helpful if you don\u2019t have these machines at your gym or haven\u2019t trained with them regularly. Use this time to see how they feel before race day.\n\n**Aim for 3-5 minutes** until you\u2019re sweating, your breathing is slightly elevated, and your skin feels warmer. You just want that blood flowing before moving on.\n\n### Step 2: Prep Your Lower Body for Running\n\nHyrox is a running race more than anything, so we want to make sure you\u2019re ready for that demand.\n\nBefore hopping on the treadmill, I like doing a little lower body prep:\n\n- Calf raises\n\n- Pogo hops\n\n- Skipping\n\nThese simple movements get your lower body ready for the volume and intensity you\u2019re about to put it through.\n\n### Step 3: Running-Specific Warm-Up\n\nNext, hop on the treadmill (usually there are Air Runners in the warm-up center). This continues building on your aerobic warm-up and further elevates your core temperature.\n\nStart with\n\n**about 5 minutes of easy Zone 2 running**\u2014simple, conversational pace.\n\nThen finish with some strides or pickups at your estimated 1K race pace. You don\u2019t need a ton of these\u2014maybe\n\n**30 seconds on, 30 seconds easy for 3-5 reps**. This primes your body for running at that pace and effort, and helps you gauge how you\u2019re feeling that day.\n\n**Important:** This run should NOT exhaust you or take away from your ability to run once the race starts. Keep it short. Get a little easy aerobic work in, feel your pace, and move on.\n\n### Step 4: Touch the Sleds (But Don\u2019t Overdo It)\n\nThis is where people get into trouble.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t been using a sled in training, I do recommend practicing your push and pull technique to feel what the weight is like. The sleds are the heaviest stations and they come early in the race, so it\u2019s smart to warm up those big muscle groups.\n\n**The Key:** One to two laps max.\n\nThe warm-up area track is shorter than the race course anyway, so it won\u2019t be as exhausting\u2014but conserve your energy. The goal is to touch the sled, see how it\u2019s moving, practice your form, and get a feel for the day.\n\n### Step 5: Optional Station Touch-Ups\n\nFrom here, you can prepare for anything else you feel you need:\n\n- A few wall balls to dial in your target height\n\n- Some air squats to warm up your legs\n\n- A few bodyweight lunges\n\n- Practice farmers carry grip\n\nBetween your aerobic warm-up on the rower/SkiErg, running prep, and touching the sleds, you\u2019ve already warmed up most of your main muscle groups.\n\n**You do not need to do a mini Hyrox in the warm-up area.** You don\u2019t need a million sets and reps of everything. Just see what things feel like, go through some bodyweight movements, and get to the tunnel feeling confident and ready.\n\n### Fueling During Your Warm-Up\n\nI really encourage you to sip on something like Gatorade, a carbohydrate beverage, or electrolytes during your warm-up to make sure your glycogen stores are topped off and your blood glucose is ready to go.\n\n**Timing Tip:** Either keep fueling more than 30 minutes out from race start, or consume within the final 10 minutes before the gun goes off. Avoid that 20-10 minute window to prevent an insulin spike and blood glucose crash.\n\n### The Mental Side of Warming Up\n\nJust as much as the warm-up is physical, it\u2019s about getting into the mental headspace you need to race.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re someone who needs to lock in and focus. Maybe you\u2019re going for a PR or racing solo. Maybe you and a friend are looking to crush it together. Or maybe you\u2019re out there to just have fun.\n\nGet your headphones on, lock in, focus on what you need for the day. Cheer on a friend. Talk to someone else who\u2019s new or excited just like you. Whatever gets you in the zone.\n\nOnce you get into the tunnel, be prepared for the day ahead. Know that your training did what it needed to do. You warmed up just enough to be ready\u2014but not so much that you\u2019re burned out before you hit that start line.\n\n### Hyrox Warm-Up Quick Reference\n\n|Step|Activity|Duration|\n|--|--|--|\n|1. Core Temperature|Rower or SkiErg \u2013 easy effort|3-5 min|\n|2. Lower Body Prep|Calf raises, pogo hops, skipping|2-3 min|\n|3.

## Original Prompt

```
You are a research analyst building a knowledge base for an AI-powered Hyrox coach.

Your task is to produce a comprehensive reference document covering:

1. **Hyrox Event Format**
   - Exact structure: 8 x 1km runs + 8 functional workout stations
   - Station order, distances, weights, and reps for each division (Open, Pro, Elite)
   - Transition zone rules, penalties, equipment specs

2. **Competitive Benchmarking**
   - World record times (Men/Women, each division)
   - Breakdown of where time is spent: running vs stations vs transitions
   - What separates a 60-min finisher from a 75-min finisher from a 90-min finisher
   - Which stations are the biggest "time sinks" for most athletes

3. **Pacing Strategy**
   - Optimal pacing for 1km segments (negative split? even split?)
   - Heart rate zone management across the race
   - Station-specific pacing (e.g., SkiErg pace, sled push strategy, wall balls tempo)
   - When to push vs. conserve

4. **Common Mistakes & Race Execution**
   - Most common training and race-day errors
   - Nutrition/hydration during the event
   - Warm-up protocols
   - Mental models used by top competitors

5. **Station-by-Station Tactical Breakdown**
   For each of the 8 stations (SkiErg, Sled Push, Sled Pull, Burpee Broad Jumps,
   Rowing, Farmers Carry, Sandbag Lunges, Wall Balls):
   - Optimal technique and form cues
   - Common efficiency mistakes
   - Training benchmarks (e.g., "you should be able to do X in Y time")
   - Muscle groups taxed and how they carry over to the next run

IMPORTANT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Length: This must be a LONG, EXHAUSTIVE reference document — at minimum 3,000-5,000 words. Do not summarize. Expand every section fully.
- Format: Use structured markdown with H2/H3 headers, markdown tables for all benchmarks and comparisons, and bullet lists for tactical details.
- Tables are critical: Use markdown tables for station weights/reps by division, world record breakdowns, time comparisons, and pacing targets.
- This content will be chunked and embedded into a vector database for semantic search, so write in natural language that matches coaching queries like "how should I pace my sled push" or "what heart rate should I target on run 5."
- Be specific: Include actual numbers, times, weights, paces, heart rate zones — not vague generalities.
- Cite sources: When referencing a specific claim, athlete quote, or study, include the source name inline.
```
