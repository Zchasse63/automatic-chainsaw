## 1. PRVN (Proven Training — Tia-Clair Toomey & Shane Orr)

### Creator/Origin

**Correction on attribution:** Based on the research data, PRVN Fitness is built on the expertise of **Tia-Clair Toomey** (7x Fittest Woman on Earth, not Kara Saunders) and her husband/coach **Shane Orr**, one of the most decorated coaches in CrossFit history. The program operates out of PRVN Nashville (2600 Fessey Park Rd, Nashville, TN 37204) and has expanded aggressively into HYROX-specific programming, affiliate programming, supplement sales, and apparel. PRVN describes its mission as empowering "as many people across the globe to reach new heights and become PRVN" (Source: BTWB Programs page).

### Session Format

Each PRVN Affiliate session follows a tightly managed **60-minute class structure**:

| Time Block | Component | Duration |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| 0:00–3:00 | Whiteboard brief | 3 min |
| 3:00–12:00 | Warm-up (movement-specific) | 9 min |
| 12:00–18:00 | Barbell Primer / Skill Progression | 6 min |
| 18:00–23:00 | Build to working loads | 5 min |
| 23:00–35:00 | Weightlifting / Strength piece | 12 min |
| 35:00–40:00 | Transition | 5 min |
| 40:00–52:00 | WOD / Conditioning | 12 min |
| 52:00–55:00 | Clean-up | 3 min |
| 55:00–60:00 | Mobility + Cool Down | 5 min |

**Key structural features:**
- Warm-ups are built around **intended muscle group activation**, range of motion, and muscle imbalance prevention
- Every day includes **skill progressions and technique primers** specific to beginners through elite
- **Mobility is integrated** into the 60-minute class (not optional post-class)
- Optional **bulletproofing/accessory** work is provided for athletes to do on their own time
- **Multiple scaling levels** (Level 1, 2, 3) are provided for WODs with distinct loading and rep prescriptions

(Source: BTWB Programs page, Rogue Fitness product page)

### Progression Model

PRVN programs in named **cycles** (e.g., "Artemis Cycle," "Poseidon Cycle") with clear periodization:

- **Powerlifting:** 5-3-1 style progression focused on maintaining strength in critical rep ranges (Back Squat, Strict Press, Deadlift toward 1RM testing)
- **Weightlifting:** Alternating weekly focus — complexes for technique building and familiarity with ~3RM/ladder work, progressing from hang positional work to power variations to full lifts
- **Gymnastics:** Strict strength development → high skill integration → Murph prep
- **Conditioning:** Balanced across time domains — one workout/week targeting 7–11 min, one at 11–15 min, one at 20+ min, plus intervals and EMOMs for capacity
- **Transition phases** align with the CrossFit Open (3-week transition), front-loading strength and back-loading Open workout intensity
- **HYROX track** uses structured **8-week cycles** year-round

### Hyrox Applicability Analysis

**What Transfers Well:**
- **PRVN HYROX track** is purpose-built — 8-week cycles, daily programming, race-day priming protocols, and leveled scaling make this a direct fit
- The **Affiliate program's conditioning structure** (balanced time domains from 7–11 min through 20+ min) mirrors the varied demands of Hyrox (roughly 60–90 min race with alternating running and functional stations)
- **EMOM and interval formatting** (e.g., "Bowser") closely replicates the work:rest pacing demands of transitioning between Hyrox running segments and stations
- **Sled work** is explicitly programmed (Crossover Sled Drags in accessories), which is one of the most Hyrox-specific movements
- **Farmer carries** are regularly included in accessory work
- **Multi-level scaling** (Levels 1/2/3) allows an AI coach to auto-scale based on athlete profile
- **Cyclical endurance sessions** (Thursday aerobic focus with running + rowing) build the aerobic base Hyrox demands

**What's Missing or Needs Modification:**
- The **Affiliate track prioritizes CrossFit competition movements** (Ring Muscle-Ups, Chest-to-Bar Pull-Ups, Snatches) that have zero Hyrox transfer
- **Running volume is insufficient** for Hyrox prep — Thursday is the primary running day, but Hyrox athletes need 3–4 dedicated running sessions per week
- **Olympic lifting frequency** is higher than necessary for Hyrox; that time would be better spent on rowing/ski erg/bike intervals and running progressions
- **Wall balls** are programmed but not at Hyrox-specific standards (100 reps at specific target height)
- **Burpee broad jumps** are absent from most sample programming
- **SkiErg** is available but not emphasized in the way Hyrox demands

**Modification for 16-Week Hyrox Prep:**
1. Replace Olympic lifting days with Hyrox-specific station practice (wall balls ×100, sled push/pull, rowing 1km, burpee broad jumps ×80m)
2. Add 2–3 weekly running sessions at varied intensities (Zone 2 base, tempo, race-pace intervals)
3. Retain the EMOM/interval conditioning format but swap CrossFit movements for Hyrox station movements
4. Keep the 5-3-1 strength progression but focus on squat, deadlift, and lunges (eliminate strict press emphasis)
5. Use the PRVN HYROX track directly if available, supplementing with additional running volume

### Key Programming Principles for AI Coach Extraction

1. **Themed daily structure** with clear intent (strength day, aerobic day, sprint day) — the AI should assign a daily purpose
2. **Multi-level scaling** (Level 1/2/3) based on athlete capability — the AI should auto-prescribe the appropriate level
3. **Percentage-based strength work** building through 5-3-1 progressions to 1RM testing
4. **Named training cycles** with transition phases — the AI should plan in 6–8 week mesocycles
5. **60-minute session architecture** with time blocks — the AI should structure every session with warm-up, primer, main work, conditioning, and mobility
6. **Balanced time-domain exposure** across the week (short sprint, medium grind, long endurance)
7. **Integrated mobility** within the session, not optional afterthought

### Core Philosophy

Fraser's programming philosophy centers on several principles derived from his competitive career:

1. **Percentage-based progression:** All strength training is based on 1RM percentages, with RPE tools available for athletes who haven't yet tested maxes. This ensures individualization at scale.
2. **Phase-based structure aligned to the CrossFit season:** Flagship 2.0 follows "thoughtfully designed PHASES that progress strength and work capacity, tailored to the CROSSFIT SEASON" culminating with the Open and Quarterfinals.
3. **Community synchronization:** Unlike the original Flagship (where everyone started on Day 1 regardless of join date), Flagship 2.0 has all athletes on the same training day for "better coaching support, real-time leaderboards, and sharing your fitness journey."
4. **Deload intelligence:** The program uses 4-week blocks with 3 weeks on and 1 deload week. Two 4-week blocks form an 8-week cycle, and the macro structure operates in 16-week super-cycles (16-16-16).
5. **Intensity through forced breaks:** Rather than long unbroken AMRAPs, Fraser programs short work windows with built-in rest (e.g., 4 × 2-min AMRAPs with 1-min rest) to force higher intensity output per window.

### Weekly Template

**HWPO Flagship 2.0 Typical Week:**

| Day | Components | Approximate Duration |
|-----|------------|---------------------|
| **Day 1** | Warm-up → Squats (heavy) + Olympic Lift → Metcon → Accessories → (Bonus) | ~2 hours |
| **Day 2** | Warm-up → Front Squats (lighter) + Pressing → Rowing/Bike piece → Accessories | ~2 hours |
| **Day 3** | Warm-up → Deadlift + Olympic Lift → Metcon → Accessories → (Bonus) | ~2 hours |
| **Day 4** | Warm-up → Bench Press + Gymnastics → Conditioning piece → Accessories | ~1.5–2 hours |
| **Day 5** | Warm-up → 40-min EMOM or longer conditioning → Accessories | ~1.5–2 hours |
| **Day 6** | Active recovery: light spin bike, swimming, or easy run | 30–60 min |
| **Day 7** | Full rest | — |

**Key structural patterns:**
- **Squats 2×/week:** One heavy back squat day, one lighter front squat day
- **Deadlifts 1×/week**
- **Bench press 1×/week**
- **Olympic lifts ~3×/week** with volume varying by cycle
- **Rowing appears heavily** throughout — Fraser is a known rowing advocate
- **10–22+ working strength sets** per session before conditioning
- **Metcons last 12–20 minutes** typically
- **Accessories always present;** bonus work (often Zone 2 cardio) is optional

### Session Structure: HWPO Flagship vs. Flagship 60 vs. PRO

**Flagship Session Architecture:**
1. Coaching video from Mat Fraser or staff coach (intent briefing)
2. Intentional warm-up (mimicking session movements)
3. Strength progressions with strength accessory work
4. Gymnastics progressions
5. Metcon OR monostructural conditioning (rowing, running, swimming)
6. Accessories
7. Optional bonus/extra workout (can add ~1 hour)

**Flagship 60** removes either a strength piece or accessory piece(s) from Flagship; occasionally shortens the metcon by 25–33% or lightens strength percentages slightly. Never exceeds 70 minutes including warm-up and clean-up.

**HWPO PRO** requires:
- 2 sessions/day, 3–4 hours total
- Top 300 Quarterfinal placement
- Specific strength minimums (245/155 lb Snatch, 275/185 lb C&J, 365 lb Back Squat)
- No modifications or scaling
- Access to track, pool, specialty equipment
- Off-Season and Comp Prep phases with track variations (Aerobic Focus track for athletes who struggle with longer metcons)

**HWPO Strong 2.0:**
- Each session: warm-up → primary lift → secondary lift → accessory work → optional metcon/conditioning
- 60–75 minutes per session
- 4–8 week blocks with deload every 4th week
- Hybrid percentage + RPE progression

**Workout 2: HWPO Flagship — Typical Heavy Squat Day (Reconstructed from Review Data)**

*Warm-Up:* Movement-specific activation, 2–3 rounds
*Strength:* Back Squat — heavy sets (percentage-based, progressing through cycle)
- Example: 5 × 3 @82–88% 1RM (building across sets)
*Olympic Lift:* Power Clean or Snatch variation — 3–5 working sets
*Metcon:* 4 × 2:00 AMRAP with 1:00 rest — high-intensity work windows with mixed modality
*Accessories:* GHD work, single-leg variations

**Workout 3: HWPO — Saturday 40-Minute EMOM (Typical Long Conditioning)**
- 40:00 EMOM alternating stations:
  - Min 1: Row Calories
  - Min 2: Wall Balls
  - Min 3: KB Swings
  - Min 4: Box Jumps
  - (Repeat 10 rounds)
- Built-in intensity elements in 1–2 stations to prevent "cruise control"

**Workout 4: HWPO Sweat — Full Body (Published Sample)**
- 0:00–12:00 — EMOM 12:
  - 1a. Glute Bridge × 30s
  - 1b. Side Plank Hip Touch × 20s each side
  - 1c. Walking or Stationary Lunge × 30s
- (Followed by AMRAP conditioning and accessory circuit — minimal equipment)

**Workout 5: HWPO Strong 2.0 — Typical Session Structure**
- Warm-up: targeted activation
- Primary Lift: e.g., Back Squat 4 × 5 @75–82% (progressing week to week)
- Secondary Lift: e.g., Romanian Deadlift 3 × 8
- Accessory Work: 3–4 exercises (single-leg, core, posterior chain)
- Optional Metcon: 8–12 min conditioning piece
- *Deload week every 4th week*

### Hyrox Applicability Analysis

**What Transfers Well:**
- **Rowing dominance:** HWPO programs extensive rowing volume, which directly transfers to the 1km row station in Hyrox
- **Assault/Echo Bike work** is standard — transfers to the bike erg conditioning demands
- **Zone 2 bonus work** (40-min spin bike/run @145 BPM) is exactly the aerobic base work Hyrox athletes need
- **Sandbag cleans** appear in metcons — a direct Hyrox station movement
- **Wall balls** feature in conditioning pieces
- **Forced-break interval structure** (short AMRAPs with built-in rest) trains the ability to sustain high output across transitions, exactly like moving between Hyrox running and station segments
- **4-week block periodization with deloads** is directly applicable to a 16-week Hyrox prep (4 mesocycles)
- **Percentage-based strength work** keeps loading individualized and progressive
- **Strong 2.0's structure** (primary lift + secondary lift + optional metcon in 60–75 min) is an excellent template for Hyrox strength days

**What's Missing:**
- **Running volume is grossly insufficient** for Hyrox — running appears occasionally in metcons and as bonus Zone 2, but a Hyrox athlete needs 8km of total race running and should be running 20–30+ km/week in training
- **Olympic lifting takes up significant training time** with no Hyrox transfer (no snatches, cleans, or jerks in Hyrox)
- **Gymnastic skills** (muscle-ups, handstand walks, etc.) consume programming space with zero Hyrox applicability
- **Session length of ~2 hours** is problematic for time-constrained athletes; the Flagship 60 variant helps but still sacrifices running opportunities
- **Sled push/pull** — despite being the hardest Hyrox station for many athletes — appears to be underrepresented relative to its race importance
- **Burpee broad jumps** are not standard in HWPO programming
- **Ski erg** is programmed but not at Hyrox-specific distances/intensities (1km race segment)
- **Lunges** (particularly weighted walking lunges, a Hyrox station) don't appear with the specificity or volume Hyrox demands

**Modification for 16-Week Hyrox Prep:**
1. Use the **4-week block + deload structure** (4 mesocycles of 3+1)
2. Replace all Olympic lifting with Hyrox station practice and additional running
3. Keep the **squat, deadlift, and bench** strength progressions (excellent base for sled, lunge, and wall ball performance)
4. Expand running from bonus work to **3–4 dedicated sessions/week** at varying intensities
5. Adopt the **forced-break interval metcon format** but populate it with Hyrox movements
6. Use the **Flagship 60 or Strong 2.0 template** as the base structure to keep sessions manageable

### Key Programming Principles for AI Coach Extraction

1. **Phased periodization in 4-week blocks** with programmed deload weeks — the AI must auto-schedule deloads
2. **1RM percentage-based loading** with RPE fallback for untested athletes
3. **Coaching video/intent briefing model** — the AI should provide intent and stimulus descriptions for every session
4. **Forced-break interval design** to maximize intensity within work windows
5. **Community synchronization** (everyone on the same day) improves accountability — the AI should support cohort-based training
6. **Distinct tracks for different time budgets** (2-hour vs 60-min) — the AI needs a session-length selector that trims intelligently (remove accessories, shorten metcon, lighten percentages)
7. **Progressive onboarding** — new athletes start with introductory weeks before full-intensity programming
8. **Heavy emphasis on monostructural conditioning** (dedicated rowing, biking, running pieces separate from metcons)

## 3. CompTrain (Ben Bergeron)

### Program Overview

CompTrain is Ben Bergeron's programming platform, born from his 15 years coaching elite CrossFit Games athletes and his broader philosophy around gym programming as a retention and community-building tool. CompTrain positions itself explicitly as **gym programming** — designed for affiliate class settings rather than individual competitors.

**Program tiers:**

| Track | Format | Target Audience | Description |
|-------|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| **CompTrain Gym Programming** | 6 days/week class plans | Affiliate owners & coaches | Complete daily lesson plans with coaching notes, scaling, and class management |
| **Benchmark testing** | Every 2 weeks | All members | 24 repeated workouts/year for progress tracking |

CompTrain is available through the **Wodify Marketplace** and its own platform (comptrain.com). The programming is delivered as turnkey class plans that coaches can implement immediately.

**Key positioning difference:** While PRVN and HWPO are athlete-facing (individuals subscribe), CompTrain is primarily **gym-facing** (affiliate owners subscribe, members follow in class). Bergeron emphasizes that "programming is a retention tool" and that a dedicated employee handles programming creation while he reviews everything. (Source: YouTube interview)

### "Intentional Intensity" Philosophy

CompTrain's programming philosophy rests on several explicitly stated principles:

1. **Program for the majority, not the top 10%:** "Programming for the top 10% of your athletes and scaling for the rest doesn't work." The goal is workouts that are "doable but difficult for most" where the class does the same work together.

2. **Consistent weekly structure with variance in workouts:** A "predictable rhythm to the schedule" that members can build routines around, while the specific movements and loadings change.

3. **Concurrent development:** "Rather than focusing on building strength one month, endurance in another, and high-intensity capacity in the next, we build them together every week and all year round." This is a fundamentally different periodization approach from PRVN and HWPO's blocked phases.

4. **Intentional intensity:** "Intensity drives results, but when structured poorly and without intelligent controls around volume, it can become the barrier to progress." CompTrain implements this through "movement pairings, loading, & rep schemes that fall into our programming sweet spot for sustainable power output."

5. **No complex gymnastics:** "We don't program complex gymnastic movements... The reality of your member's lives demands strength, endurance, and capacity. It doesn't require them to know how to walk on their hands."

6. **Running as a cornerstone:** Programming includes "running 2-3 times a week at varying intensities and distances" — significantly more running emphasis than most CrossFit programming platforms.

7. **Benchmark testing every 2 weeks:** 24 workouts repeated annually for progress tracking — "progress is not just hoped for but expected and achieved."

### Weekly Template

CompTrain publishes its weekly structure explicitly:

| Day | Strength Component | Conditioning Component | Duration |
|-----|--------------------|----------------------|----------|
| **Monday** | Press (Bench or Shoulder Press) | 8–18 min Conditioning | ~60 min |
| **Tuesday** | — | 20–35 min Conditioning | ~60 min |
| **Wednesday** | Pull (Deadlift / Sumo Deadlift) | 8–18 min Conditioning | ~60 min |
| **Thursday** | — | 20–35 min Conditioning | ~60 min |
| **Friday** | Squat (Front or Back Squat) | 8–18 min Conditioning | ~60 min |
| **Saturday** | — | 20–35 min Team Workouts | ~60 min |
| **Sunday** | — | Run 2–3 miles | ~30 min |

(Source: comptrain.com/gym-programming-principles)

**Key structural patterns:**
- **3 strength days** (Mon/Wed/Fri) each paired with a shorter conditioning piece (8–18 min)
- **3 conditioning-only days** (Tue/Thu/Sat) with longer workouts (20–35 min)
- **Saturday is team day** — community-building format
- **Sunday is a dedicated run** — 2–3 miles, reinforcing running as a cornerstone
- Strength follows a **Press → Pull → Squat** rotation across the week
- **Benchmark workouts every 2 weeks** replace the scheduled conditioning piece

### Session Structure

Based on the published programming template ("Hole in the Wall"), a typical CompTrain session follows:

| Phase | Example | Duration |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Whiteboard Brief | Coach explains intent, scaling, target times | 3–5 min |
| Movement instruction | Tell, Show, Do, Check format | 5–8 min |
| Strength piece | 3 × 8 Back Squats on 3:00 clock | 12–15 min |
| Transition/Practice round | Movement rehearsal | 3–5 min |
| Conditioning piece | Every 2:00 × 5 Rounds of wallballs + DB snatches | 10–18 min |
| Post-workout cool down | Accessory/mobility/chat | 8–10 min |

**Coaching integration:** CompTrain provides detailed "Look For" coaching cues (e.g., "Flat feet — look for athletes gripping the ground with the foot throughout the rep") and specific time management guidance for class flow.

### Strength Programming Approach

CompTrain's strength work follows a notable pattern visible across months of published programming:

**Press variations (Monday):**
- Bench Press: Max Reps @80%, @90%, Heavy Set of 20, or climbing sets
- Strict Press: Max Reps, sets within 12:00 windows, 3:00 × 3 sets

**Pull variations (Wednesday):**
- Deadlift: Max Reps, 12:00 windows, climbing sets
- Sumo Deadlift: Alternates with conventional, 5-second negatives, 5–7 climbing sets

**Squat variations (Friday):**
- Back Squat: Build to Heavy Single, Max Reps @85–90%, add 10# from last attempt
- Front Squat: Max Reps @80–90%, 12:00 windows

The **"Add 10# From Last Attempt"** notation (visible in the May 10 Back Squat entry referencing 2/26/24) reveals CompTrain's long-term progressive overload tracking — the same test is repeated months later with explicit load increases.

### Representative Sample Workouts

**Workout 1: Strength + Conditioning Monday — "Hole in the Wall"**
- *Strength:* On the 3:00 × 3 Sets: 8 Back Squats — Start at 60% and build
- *Conditioning:* Every 2:00 × 5 Rounds: 25 Wall Balls (20/14 lb) + Max DB Snatches (50/35 lb)
- *Score:* Total DB Snatches
- *Scaling:* Reduce wallball reps/loading/target height as needed
- *Target pacing:* Wall balls in :60 or less, DB snatches for ~:45

**Workout 2: Long Conditioning Tuesday — "Run Up"**
- 5 Rounds For Time:
  - 400m Run
  - 6 Strict Pull-Ups
  - 400m Run
  - 15 Push-Ups
- *Total running: 4,000m (2.5 miles)*

### Hyrox Applicability Analysis

**Strengths — What Transfers Exceptionally Well:**

1. **Running is a cornerstone.** CompTrain is the *only* program of the three that explicitly programs running 2–3×/week plus a dedicated Sunday run of 2–3 miles. This is the single most important element for Hyrox transfer. The "Run Up" workout alone includes 4km of running with bodyweight movements between — nearly identical to Hyrox's alternating run/station format.

2. **Concurrent development model** matches Hyrox demands. Hyrox athletes need strength, endurance, and capacity simultaneously — CompTrain builds all three every week, all year. This avoids the "peaked for strength but untrained aerobically" trap.

3. **Sustainable intensity philosophy** ("build up, not burn out") aligns perfectly with Hyrox training, which requires high training volume without overtraining.

4. **No complex gymnastics** removes wasted training time. CompTrain already self-selects away from muscle-ups, handstand walks, and other CrossFit-specific skills with zero Hyrox transfer.

5. **20–35 minute conditioning pieces** (Tue/Thu/Sat) are in the right duration range for simulating portions of a Hyrox race.

6. **Team workout Saturdays** build pacing awareness and competitive energy — useful for Hyrox Doubles and race-day intensity.

7. **Benchmark testing every 2 weeks** provides the regular performance data an AI coach needs to adjust training loads.

8. **Deadlift, squat, and press strength progressions** build the base needed for sled push/pull, lunges, and wall balls.

9. **Wall balls are frequently programmed** (e.g., 25 reps in "Hole in the Wall," "Nancy" features overhead squats which share movement patterns).

10. **Rowing and Bike Erg** are standard conditioning tools (e.g., "Total Whine" with alternating row/bike intervals).

**Weaknesses — What's Missing:**

1. **Sled push/pull** is not a standard CompTrain movement — this is the single biggest gap given it's the most challenging Hyrox station for most athletes.

2. **Burpee broad jumps** are absent (CompTrain programs burpees, but not the broad jump variation specific to Hyrox).

3. **Ski erg** appears occasionally but is not programmed at race-specific distances (1km).

4. **Weighted walking lunges** at Hyrox-specific loads and distances are not a standard feature.

5. **Farmer carries** are not regularly programmed in the main class (may appear in accessories).

6. **Running is 2–3×/week, but Hyrox athletes likely need 4–5×/week** at 20–30+ km total weekly volume. The Sunday 2–3 mile run is a good start but insufficient.

7. **Power cleans and overhead squats** consume training time with limited Hyrox transfer beyond general fitness.

8. **Time-domain distribution** may skew shorter than ideal — many conditioning pieces are 8–18 min, but Hyrox race duration is 60–90+ min. More 30–45 min pieces would help.

**Modification for 16-Week Hyrox Prep:**
1. **Keep the Monday/Wednesday/Friday strength + conditioning structure** — it's excellent
2. **Replace Tuesday/Thursday conditioning with Hyrox-specific sessions:** e.g., "Hyrox simulation" workouts with 1km run + station, repeated 4× with different stations
3. **Increase Sunday run to 5–8km** and add a second dedicated run on Tuesday or Thursday
4. **Add sled work 2×/week** (push and pull at Hyrox race loads)
5. **Program Hyrox station practice as the conditioning pieces:** wall balls ×100, burpee broad jumps ×80m, farmer carry ×200m, lunges ×200m
6. **Use benchmark workouts as Hyrox-specific tests:** e.g., timed 1km row, timed 200m sled push, timed 100 wall balls
7. **Retain the concurrent development philosophy** — never drop strength entirely, but shift from max-strength testing to strength-endurance (higher reps, moderate load)

### Key Programming Principles for AI Coach Extraction

1. **Concurrent development:** Build strength, endurance, and capacity every week — never enter a "strength-only" or "endurance-only" phase
2. **Running as a non-negotiable cornerstone** at 2–3×/week minimum — the AI must include running in every weekly plan
3. **Predictable weekly structure with movement variance** — athletes should know "Monday is strength + conditioning" but the specific movements change
4. **"Intentional intensity" controls:** Movement pairings, loading, and rep schemes that create sustainable power output — the AI should calculate and cap total session volume/intensity
5. **Benchmark testing cadence:** Repeat standardized tests every 2 weeks to track progress — the AI needs a testing protocol library
6. **Program for the median athlete, not the top 10%** — the AI should default to accessible movements and scale up, not the reverse
7. **Team/partner formats** weekly for community and pacing practice
8. **Class-duration constraint** (~60 min) forces efficient session design — the AI should respect time budgets
9. **"Add weight from last attempt" progressive overload tracking** — the AI must store and reference historical performance data
10. **Detailed coaching cues per movement** ("Look For" format) — the AI should provide real-time technique reminders

### Synthesis: Optimal AI Coach Design Principles

Drawing from all three programs, an AI coaching system for Hyrox preparation should:

1. **Use HWPO's 4-week block periodization with deloads** (3 on / 1 deload) within a 16-week macro
2. **Adopt CompTrain's concurrent development philosophy** — never sacrifice running or endurance for a "strength phase"
3. **Follow PRVN's 60-minute session architecture** with time-blocked phases (warm-up → primer → main work → conditioning → mobility)
4. **Program running 3–4×/week minimum** (borrowing CompTrain's cornerstone principle and expanding it)
5. **Use HWPO's percentage-based loading with RPE fallback** for all strength work
6. **Implement PRVN's multi-level scaling** (3 tiers per workout) to serve athletes from beginner to advanced
7. **Design conditioning pieces in HWPO's forced-break interval format** but populate them with Hyrox-specific movements
8. **Test benchmarks every 2 weeks** (CompTrain model) using Hyrox-specific standards (1km row time, 200m sled push time, 100 wall balls time, 8km run time)
9. **Provide intent briefings** for every session (HWPO coaching video model translated to text/AI guidance)
10. **Exclude non-transferable movements** (Olympic lifts, complex gymnastics, handstand walks) in favor of Hyrox station work — following CompTrain's pragmatic movement selection philosophy

This synthesized approach captures the periodization intelligence of HWPO, the session structure and scalability of PRVN, and the sustainable conditioning philosophy and running emphasis of CompTrain — creating a purpose-built Hyrox preparation system.

{ts:30} like  170  days  now  i  wanted  to  do  an 
 update  a  day  150  i  thought  that  was  a
{ts:36} 
 while  um  and  enough  to  kind  of  give

…

{ts:126} there's  a  four  week 
 block
{ts:129} 
 if  that  makes  sense  so  basically  you 

{ts:132} have  eight  weeks 
 in  that  eight  weeks  it's  obviously  broke
{ts:134} 
 down  into  two  four  week  segments  and
{ts:136} that  four  week  segment  is  broken  down 
 into  three  weeks  on  and  one  week  off  and
{ts:142} 
 the  reason  i have  to 

{ts:144} this  um  is  because  the  week  off  it's  not 
 a week  off  it's  just  a  deload  week
{ts:149} 
 still  super  heavy

…

{ts:164} be  um  not  every  week  obviously  but  when 
 you  ramp  up  with  roundtable
{ts:169} 
 so  that's  the  structure  as  best  as  i  can 

{ts:171} understand  it  at  the  moment  uh  it  works 
 well  so  there's  already  been
{ts:175}

…

{ts:210} as  best  as  we  can  kind  of  talk  about  it 
 it's  an  eight-week  cycle  in  that  cycle
{ts:215} 
 there's  four  weeks  four  weeks 

{ts:217} and  he  has  been  broken  down  into 
 the  big  one  is  like  the  16  weeks  so  16
{ts:222} 
 weeks  16  16  16  so  for  them  because  he

…

{ts:257} possibly  two  days  every  other  day  of  the

…

{ts:437} then 
 a  mekong  then  three  pieces  of
{ts:441} 
 accessories  and  then  a  bonus  so  there's

When most class members are doing the same class workout, the vibe is better, the community is stronger, and the consistency is greater. The result is increased fitness and a better business.

**We program for a consistent weekly structure **

We balance a predictable rhythm to the schedule with variance in workouts.

Every week, your members will get:
This simple structure promotes clear, consistent progress for members but also keeps training enjoyable and engaging.

It helps each member build a sustainable routine, promoting growth and forging a strong community within your gym.

**We program benchmark workouts every two weeks.**

Every year we repeat 24 workouts to make progress tracking easy for your members.
This visibility, consistency, and accountability will show them on a regular basis how they are improving over time.

Through routine testing and clear metrics, you'll create a gym community where progress is not just hoped for but expected and achieved.

**We program to build strength, endurance, and capacity sustainably.**

Rather than focusing on building strength one month, endurance in another, and high-intensity capacity in the next, we build them together every week and all year round.

…

The result: Your members will build up, not burn out.

**We program running as a cornerstone. **

Traveling efficiently from one point to another is as functional as it gets. Because it's one of the most fundamental movements your members will ever do, they need repeated, consistent exposure to it.

This is why your programming will include running 2-3 times a week at varying intensities and distances. Your members’ fitness will be grounded in this natural human movement.

…

By embracing a drive for evolution, we aim to be both relevant and revolutionary.

We are now entering Week 1 of the CrossFit Open and this will mark the start of our Transition Phase. We will use the 3 Week CrossFit Open as our Transition phase in order to help us set the week up in a way that allows for more consistent structure week to week with the goal of front loading the week with our Strength progressions and then having the later half of the week set-up to align with the focus of tackling the Open workout at full intensity as a true test of fitness. Our weekend workouts will be similar in structure to what we have seen over the course of the last cycle with Sunday leaning into a little more strength work as well in order to keep our programming well rounded.

**Programming Approach: **

Our powerlifting work will follow a 5-3-1 style progression with a primary focus on maintaining strength in this critical rep range. This will serve as the basis for our strength progressions with some specific strength EMOMs that will serve as extra hypertrophy, stability, and bulletproofing for the body. This style will serve to help build a well rounded body that can handle the more loads and volume later down the line into the Months of May, June, and July.

Our weightlifting work will focus on maintaining top end strength and technical confidence, while also working on complexes to not only hone technique, but also build familiarity for the ~3 rep max or ladder work. This will help us progress the lifts from the previous cycles where we were targeting more hang positional work as well as the Power variations of the lifts for greater rep ranges in the Artemis Cycle. This work will be blended in an alternated weekly to keep the frequency there, while having a greater focus on our Powerlifting and strength stability work.

For our gymnastics work, we will be circling around to more strict strength development, placing strict strength gymnastics progressions in as a strong foundational build that will serve us well as we move into Murph Prep towards the end of this cycle and into the beginning of our next cycle. We will continue to build in the high skill gymnastics work and skill progressions, but the emphasis for modifications on those days will lean more towards strength development as well.

Lastly, when it comes to our conditioning work, we will be focused on targeting a well balanced programming that limits biased work with the goal of hitting one workout a week that targets the 7-11min Time Domain, one workout that targets the 11-15min Time Domain, and one workout that targets the 20+ minute time domain, with the others placed in as interval workout variations or EMOMs to target capacity and muscular endurance.

**Programming Goals:**

– 1RM Back Squat, 1RM Strict Press, 1RM Deadlift

– Confidence and Consistency at 90% and higher for the Snatch, Clean, and Jerk

– Strict Gymnastics Strength Development Work / Isometrics

– Unilateral Upper and Lower Body Strength Work

– The Weekly Strength and Stability EMOM

### What to Expect This Week:

- Monday: Back Squat 5RM and a 15:00 Grind of an AMRAP.

- Tuesday: Ring Muscle-Ups Skills + Practice into a Burner of an EMOM centered around midline and quad stamina.

- Wednesday: Touch and Go 5RM Power Clean some barbell cycling fun!

- Thursday: Mix Modal Endurance Based workout as a little active flush before our Open Workout Friday

- Friday: Open 25.1 from 4pm programmed classes in the monring

- Saturday: Member of the month WOD (LIAM)

- Sunday: Strength Focused EMOM, that gives us a glimpse and feel into some EMOMs to come in our next cycle.

This week will finish off our testing phase for the Artemis Cycle, have us tackle 25.1 on either Friday or Saturday and help us transition and set-up our upcoming ‘Poseidon’ Cycle.

**Fetched: [HWPO Programming Review - My Experience With ...](https://garagegymrevisited.com/hwpo-programming-review/)**
Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the past 7 or 8 years, you’re probably

*pretty *familiar with Mat Fraser.

You don’t even need to watch the video; the title is enough.

“Mat Fraser is the Five-Time Fittest Man on Earth”

(Fraser even wrote a ~300-page book detailing his adventure; you can read my review of the Hard Work Pays Off Book here!)

Fraser retired from the sport after his fifth CrossFit Games and could have easily ridden off into the sunset. He certainly had a lot of endorsements and prize money to last him.

Instead, he decided to grace the world with his take on CrossFit training, creating a program, HWPO (“Hard Work Pays Off”) that can be had for $40 a month.

I followed HWPO’s Flagship program pretty closely for roughly 18 months and feel as though I have a pretty good grasp on what the training is all about.

Here is my HWPO programming review (as well as my wife’s experience with HWPO 60) and my thoughts on how it may or may not be

*the* program for other CrossFitters.

TLDR: It is a pretty good CrossFit training program…but I

*much* prefer (both the program itself and my results) Sentinel Training.

Table of Contents

## Program Structure

The HWPO programming structure is unique (to me at least) in the manner in which each workout is scheduled. Rather than simply dropping you in to wherever a particular program is at the current moment (Ex. Comptrain), there is a definite “Day 1”, “Day 100”, “Day 400” and on. You’ll start with the same workouts everybody else has started with and work through the same cycles whether you jump in early January, April, or October.

(that year, there was a “Open Prep” option added for those looking to prep for the upcoming open, but this was programming split off from the “Flagship” track).

I like this structure and think that it gets all participants “up to speed” with the program’s overall structure as well as those of each workout. Even advanced athletes would likely struggle if they randomly dropped into “Day 273” of the program due to relatively intense nature of the workouts. The first few program weeks do an excellent job of preparing athletes for the rigors to come.

Fraser has programmed a number of cycles and “waves” into the program, most notably those involving squats, Olympic lifts and rowing…yeah…rowing.

You do

*a lot *of rowing the HWPO training program! Mal O’Brien can confirm!

There is obviously a method to this and I can attest that my strength and rowing

*endurance *levels (I still needed a bit of technique work!) have gotten better (and probably better than they *would *have gotten with other, general programming) with HWPO programming.

There are 5 “normal” training days each week. One day is a full rest day while another day involves much shorter and “lighter” activity (ex. spin bike, light swimming).

## Workout Structure – HWPO Flagship vs. HWPO 60

Now that I have experience with multiple HWPO training programs, I will split this section up to discuss each in detail.

### HWPO Flagship

Workouts in the Flagship program take on a pretty consistent pattern. A decently intense active warm-up (with movements somewhat mimicking the exercises) starts things off followed by strength pieces. Without fail, squats and front squats are programmed twice a week and deadlifts and bench press each once a week. Olympic lifts are generally performed three days each week with the volume and variety differing depending on the cycle.

The overall volume and rep counts differ greatly here, but you can expect to perform between 10 and 22-25 working sets during this portion. All of the weights for these sets are based off of 1RM percentages.

After the strength piece there is some kind of cardio element, whether in the form of a classic metcon, a dedicated rowing piece, or a dedicated Assault Bike/Echo Bike piece. These generally last between 12 and 20 minutes.

Accessory work and “Bonus work” close out each workout. While the bonus content is not always present, accessory work

*always *is. Interestingly enough, these portions vary *greatly *in length and intensity. Some days, a few sets of GHD-machine back extensions are programmed. Other times, you might find something like…this…

The length of HWPO training workouts has been discussed at length before and, truth be told, the workouts can go

*pretty *long. I generally keep my rest periods between 2 and 3 minutes during the strength pieces and still end up hitting my self-imposed 1:50 workout “time cap” about 70 percent of the time.

I know others rest less than I do during these pieces, but I don’t rest very long between pieces. As such, I don’t know who can reasonably expect to consistently get through these workouts in less than 1:45. If you’re not particularly “fast”, expect to make some cuts to each workout.

### HWPO 60

Recently, my wife started the “HWPO 60” program…and is

*loving *it. After bouncing around between HWPO Flagship (we started at the same time, although she switched programs after about 10 months) and Street Parking (and one…less-than-enjoyable day of PRVN) she decided to re-join the HWPO “family”!

Although it has been quite a while since she started HWPO Flagship, via careful notes she kept, she is able to compare the early days of the program to the first week of HWPO. Essentially, the program content are very,

*very *similar.

**The main difference**? On most days of HWPO 60, either a strength piece or an accessory piece (sometimes multiple accessory pieces) is removed from the HWPO Flagship program. More rarely, the metcon or rowing piece is anywhere between 25 and 33 percent shorter and/or the percentages for strength workouts are slightly lighter.

Other than that, the programs are the same. My wife has never clocked a longer than 70 minutes in an HWPO 60 workout (completing

*all* pieces *and *accounting for warm-up and clean-up time) yet still feels as though she is getting a *complete* training experience.

## Intensity

There are definitely intensity waves programmed into the HWPO programming, but

*everything *feels pretty intense to me most of the time. Even the standard 40-minute EMOM (usually scheduled for Saturday or Sunday) generally has one or two elements that up the ante.

That being said, there is always a “heavy” squat day and a “light…ish” squat day each week. During many of the high-intensity metcons, there are built-in break periods to force you to take your foot off of the gas for a bit.

These forced breaks, while giving you a brief respite from the WOD’s rigors, actually work to

*increase *the overall intensity. In contrast to a 20-minute AMRAP that you might “get lost” in the middle of, 4, 2-minute AMRAPs with 1-minute rest periods between them forces you to *really *give it your all in each work window.

## Equipment Needs

HWPO programming assumes you have access to a good amount of equipment to include barbells, bumpers, dumbbells, kettlebells, GHD, rower, fan bike, ski erg, spin bike, weighted vest, bench, pull-up rig, rings, rope, sandbag…probably some other stuff, too, but you get the point.

You can modify a lot of the movements (and if you listen to Fraser’s detailed, 10-15-minute explanations before each workout, he’ll mention these modifications from time to time), but I think you

*really *need most of this stuff to get the most benefit from the workouts and program.

I didn’t have a ski erg or a spin bike (although I did have a dinky, cheap upright bike) so would generally sub some other type of cardio machine out for these items. The ski erg hadn’t become

*that* popular (yet) so I didn’t feel like I’ve missed out too much on something vital.

## Community

In addition to all of the programming and videos from Fraser discussing workouts and movements, there is a dedicated HWPO Circle community for all paid members.

This community functions kind of like a subreddit community or Facebook group with members discussing their workouts, asking questions, and soliciting form feedback. Generally, form-related videos receive almost instant feedback from other HWPO members. There are also HWPO staff coaches who closely monitor the groups who are quick to provide feedback.

The Circle group is probably

*most* valuable for the garage or basement gym HWPO athletes who desire more of a community setting or for those who don’t have access to eyes-on coaching. It is no substitute for immediate, in-person feedback, but it is definitely the next best thing!

## “Who is HWPO Flagship

*Truly *Designed For?”

“Intensity” and “difficulty” are not always mutually inclusive concepts, but with HWPO training, I feel as though there is a

*bit *of overlap. I oftentimes felt myself wondering “who the heck is this program *truly *designed for?!” I say this by thinking about my own capability in relation to those of the general CrossFit population.

The last couple of years, I have messed around with the CrossFit Open workouts. I have always gone hard when performing them, but haven’t re-tested any of them and haven’t altered my training to accommodate them. When the dust has cleared, I would have easily qualified for the Age-Group Quarterfinals and possibly even for the overall QFs.

That being said, I find myself scaling weights or movements during the HWPO metcons and cardio pieces between

**60 and 70 percent of the time**.

I am obviously not an elite athlete, but the top dogs are getting (good) individualized coaching and programming.

…so, again…”who the heck is this program designed for?!”

There is definitely a gap between my ability level and the

*near *top-level athletes who HWPO Flagship is probably *perfect *for. Not much scaling of weights or exercises…the *perfect *level of intensity and challenge.

However, I feel like this gap can’t be

*that *big and that most people running the program are scaling as much, if not more often than I am.

This isn’t even taking into account the long workout durations. If I didn’t work from home, if I had kids, etc. I don’t know how I’d fit it all in, seeing that I have to time cap myself anyways (I’d probably

*have* to go with HWPO 60)!

If you’re willing to humble yourself and use some discretion to scale workouts and to focus your attention on areas you need the most work on, you can

*definitely *benefit from the Flagship or HWPO 60 programs.

## Personal Results

I took the plunge into HWPO programming in February of 2022 when I first moved into my new basement gym. I had been doing some less-than-ideal and unorganized “self-programming” (sic) for close to a year in the old garage cube and was a bit out of shape.

The “on-boarding” weeks were perfect for me and I quickly re-gained much of my previous conditioning while also quickly growing accustomed to the program’s structure.

In a little over a year’s time, I set PRs in almost all of the program’s barbell movements (squat, front squat, deadlift, power snatch, snatch, strict press) with the clean and jerk being the notable exceptions (I have personal issues with these lifts that I need to get sorted with eyes-on coaching!) Additionally, my rowing and Assault Bike capabilities

Shortly before taking my break from HWPO, I re-tested CrossFit Open WOD 20.1…the infamous 10 rounds of snatches and bar-facing burpees. I had been doing HWPO for

*just *under a year at this point.

When I originally did this back in late 2019, I got time capped. My second attempt improved my time to 14:47.

My most recent time (post-HWPO training)? 14:05…a roughly 5 percent improvement.

Maybe not the

*most *impressive improvement example, but I was satisfied.

## Conclusion/Suggestion

It’s hard to argue with the CrossFit GOAT about what works…but I think he knows more about what works for

*him* than it does for the masses.

Not everyone is going to have the time to devote to HWPO Flagship workouts, the requisite equipment, the humility to scale (

*a lot *in some cases), or the desire to do intense workouts day-in and day-out.

A lot of people are also probably going to want programming that is a bit more…interesting…and productive.

HWPO wasn’t

*bad*, but man…I wish I had been doing Sentinel for at least part of the time that I spent “working with Fraser”…

**Fetched: [Simplify With Structure](https://www.comptrain.com/gym-programming-principles)**
For those leading the way in modern programming who know that

better classes build better gyms.

**We program for the best member experience possible**

Workouts should be doable but difficult for most. Programming for the top 10% of your athletes and scaling for the rest doesn't work. Your members want to follow the training as closely as prescribed each day, not two members out of twenty doing ring muscle-ups and the other 18 doing something completely different. By avoiding this, your class experience is more seamless and less disjointed.

When most class members are doing the same class workout, the vibe is better, the community is stronger, and the consistency is greater. The result is increased fitness and a better business.

**We program for a consistent weekly structure **

We balance a predictable rhythm to the schedule with variance in workouts.

Every week, your members will get:

This simple structure promotes clear, consistent progress for members but also keeps training enjoyable and engaging.

It helps each member build a sustainable routine, promoting growth and forging a strong community within your gym.

**We program benchmark workouts every two weeks.**

Every year we repeat 24 workouts to make progress tracking easy for your members.

This visibility, consistency, and accountability will show them on a regular basis how they are improving over time.

Through routine testing and clear metrics, you'll create a gym community where progress is not just hoped for but expected and achieved.

**We program to build strength, endurance, and capacity sustainably.**

Rather than focusing on building strength one month, endurance in another, and high-intensity capacity in the next, we build them together every week and all year round.

It ensures our training program moves you forward across all fitness domains, creating a well-rounded athlete ready for any challenge —whether on the field, in the gym, or in the real world.

Your members will love feeling stronger & getting fitter, slowly and sustainably.

**We program for the functional movement patterns of an active life.**

Your members want the ability to play, to compete, and to live at whatever speed they desire.

We believe in programming highly functional movements applicable across sports, outdoor adventures, and daily life. Most don't need or want sport-specific skills with narrow real-world utility.

We don't program complex gymnastic movements for this reason.

The reality of your member’s lives demands strength, endurance, and capacity. It doesn't require them to know how to walk on their hands.

**We program for members who want to train smart**

Your members want to be your members forever. They don’t want to get beat up and spit out. They don't want to keep searching. They want a training program they can do consistently, and that works.

Intensity drives results, but when structured poorly and without intelligent controls around volume, it can become the barrier to progress instead of the main driver..

We implement what we call “intentional intensity” through movement pairings, loading, & rep shemes that fall into our programming sweet spot for sustainable power output.

This allows your coaches and therefore your members to maximize their training efficiency while preventing overtraining and ensuring sustainable progress.

The result: Your members will build up, not burn out.

**We program running as a cornerstone. **

Traveling efficiently from one point to another is as functional as it gets. Because it's one of the most fundamental movements your members will ever do, they need repeated, consistent exposure to it.

This is why your programming will include running 2-3 times a week at varying intensities and distances. Your members’ fitness will be grounded in this natural human movement.

**We program with proven methods and are always adapting**

Just as you are committed to improving your gym for the long-term benefit of your members, we're committed to improving our offering for the long-term benefit of our partner gyms.

We promise to adapt, refine, and elevate our programming over time. We’ll avoid stagnating, embrace continual improvement, and remain willing to challenge our own beliefs if needed. As fitness science evolves, so does our programming.

By embracing a drive for evolution, we aim to be both relevant and revolutionary.

Track client results, analyze trends, and use data to guide athletes toward their goals.

Leaderboards, workout history, and in-platform communication help celebrate wins and keep clients connected.

The HWPO tracks are created with athlete development in mind. The program meets you where you’re at using percentages, scaling and modifying to make workouts flexible while setting you up for success.

All strength training is based on percentages. Metcons however, offer prescribed weights. Scaling options are available for all tracks with the exception of HWPO PRO. The prescribed weights for HWPO PRO metcons are intentionally set to prepare athletes to compete at the highest level of competition in the sport.

1 set 10 reps at 60 percent 1RM

2 sets of 8 reps at 63 percent 1RM

"These are bigger sets, and the percentages are meant to be lighter," says Fraser. "Because it's higher volume, I want the weight to stay light so you can focus on the good leg drive and generating the power out of your hips instead of just doing basically a strict press with a bit of kip. All the power should be generated from the legs."
**Strict Press**

4 sets of 10 reps at 90 percent of 10RM

"This is more volume but taking the legs out of the equations," says Fraser. "Now we're using our shoulders to press the weight up. The first set should feel easy, but by the fourth set, the reps should be slowing down."

**ACCESSORY**

4 sets of 20 Assisted Strict Pullups

5 sets of 15 Overhead Dumbbell Triceps Extension

3 sets of 15 Reverse Hyper (If you don't have a Reverse Hyper, do back extensions)

"The intent of this is big, big volume at a very light weight," says Fraser. "As you progress through the cycle, you can taper down the volume and intensity."

In part one we’re hitting 3 sets of 8 back squats. Athlete’s should target a load that they’re confident in for the first set and then build as they are able. In part 2 we have a total body push & total body pull in today’s workout. Athletes should target a wallball variation that allows them to finish in :60 and get straight to work on the DB. On the DB we want athletes to complete as many DB snatches as they can in about :45 before taking the time to transition back to the wallballs.

…

Flat feet. Look for athletes gripping the ground with the foot throughout the rep. Look for full range of motion with the athlete getting their hips below their knees each rep.

Looking for the DB to stay close to the body and to create a straight line from DB to foot once overhead. Look for good timing of legs finishing the drive & jump before the athlete pulls the DB with the arms. Post Workout Clean Up & Chat (52-60 Minutes)

Hwpo FLAGSHIP 2.0

HWPO FLAGSHIP 2.0 has been designed to meet you where you’re at. Training is based on percentages, scaling, and modifying, allowing both beginner and advanced athletes to progress. This program is ideally suited to someone who has trained in CrossFit® before and is looking to better their personal bests.

Follow thoughtfully designed phases with themes that track the CROSSFIT SEASON culminating with the OPEN and QUARTERFINALS. Expect NEW MOVEMENTS from any stage of the competition to appear in FLAGSHIP 2.0.

HWPO FLAGSHIP was our original track designed by Mat Fraser based on his own training experience. All new members started on DAY 1 of training, just like Mat did, but he was alone. Mat has since learned that he’s most successful when surrounded by a community training with him. FLAGSHIP 2.0 delivers this realization–all HARD WORKERS now follow the same training on the same day. Benefit from better coaching support, real-time leaderboards, and, most importantly, sharing your fitness journey with a like-minded community that is equally dedicated to SHOWING UP and WORKING HARD.

Each day starts with a coaching video from Mat Fraser or one of our world-class coaches to ensure you are hitting the proper intent and stimulus. The structure of each session includes an intentional warm up, targeted strength progressions with strength accessory work, gymnastics progressions, a metcon or monostructural conditioning such as rowing, running or swimming, and accessories. Occasionally, there is a bonus/extra workout that would require additional time if you choose to complete it.

HWPO FLAGSHIP 2.0 requires around 2 hours per day to complete, 6 days per week. If you’re limited on time you can switch to FLAGSHIP 60 to be in and out the gym in about an hour. The program is built in phases and is structured with a deload week every fourth week of the program to allow your body to properly recover while building strength and increasing capacity.

Switch between FLAGSHIP, FLAGSHIP 60, and MASTERS at anytime in the HWPO app.

**HWPO FLAGSHIP 2.0**Our full-volume, CrossFit track for athletes ready to train at high capacity, combining daily strength, conditioning, and skill work for peak performance.

**FLAGSHIP 60**A condensed version of the full program that fits into a 60-minute training window. Perfect for busy days while keeping progress and consistency on track.

**FLAGSHIP MASTERS**A tailored variant built for longevity, with reduced volume and intensity, daily mobility work, and smart programming to support recovery and sustained performance.

All variants are included in your subscription. Switch between them anytime to match your goals, energy, or schedule.

Access to a fully equipped gym is essential to getting the most out of training. If skill or equipment is limited, our extensive resource library, plus access to our HWPO Training coaches in the members only CIRCLE channel, will guide you in scaling and modifications.

You can expect a variety of machine work on rowers, bike ergs, ski ergs, and echo bikes, as well as the use of med balls, Dballs, and sandbags. Additionally, barbells and plates, dumbbells, kettlebells, and access to a rig will be required.

HWPO FLAGSHIP 2.0 is based on percentages and scaling throughout the training calendar. You will need to complete your 1RM test for exercises as you progress through training to ascertain your benchmarks.

Our world-class coaches have provided an RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) tool so that you can get started with training immediately, and worry about testing your maxes later.

Hwpo flagship 2.0

HWPO FLAGSHIP, FLAGSHIP 60, and FLAGSHIP MASTERS are flexible track options built to meet you where you are in your training. Whether you’re looking for full-volume training, a faster-paced 60-minute session, or a version that prioritizes longevity and recovery without compromising progress, each variant delivers structure, intent, and the same results.

HWPO FLAGSHIP 2.0 is our daily training program, the foundation of HWPO. Designed for athletes looking to progress and reach personal bests, this track combines strength, conditioning, and skill work into a comprehensive program that develops every aspect of fitness.

Each session is built around progressions and intent, with programmed metcons, accessory work, and optional add-ons to match your energy and goals.

Our world-class coaches know that it’s not always easy to complete the full training prescription every day of the year. So, we’ve developed a 60-minute variant of FLAGSHIP 2.0 — same intent, less time.

FLAGSHIP 60 condenses the full track into a faster-paced version that lets you SHOW UP, get the work done, and stay consistent, even on busy days. It’s flexible, efficient, and built to help you make progress without compromise.

FLAGSHIP MASTERS is designed for athletes who want to keep showing up, pushing hard, and progressing, while training smarter for the long haul. It’s built around the same HWPO principles, adapted to support recovery, joint health, and sustained performance.

Training volume and intensity are thoughtfully adjusted to suit advancing athletes, with daily mobility and preparation work to keep your body ready for what’s next. Each week balances strength, conditioning, and skill progressions with focused recovery to make every session count.

Brought to you by Colette Casey, a Games-level Masters athlete and experienced coach who ensures every session supports longevity, progress, and smart training.

You’ll move with purpose, train with intent, and stay part of a community that values HARD WORK, no matter your age or experience. This is training for MASTERS who aren’t slowing down, just evolving.

Access to a gym or a well-equipped home gym is required for this program.

HWPO FLAGSHIP 2.0 requires about 2 hours per session to complete. Occasionally, there is bonus/extra workout that would require additional time if you choose to complete it. Switch to the 60 variant if you only have about an hour to train.

Life happens! If you miss a day or two, our team suggests picking up training on the next calendar day.

If you’ve been out of training for a longer period of time due to injury or vacation our team of coaches are available in CIRCLE with tips and advice on catching up.

**Fetched: [Mat Fraser Just Shared a Workout from His Training Program](https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a36027797/mat-fraser-hwpo-workout-sample/)**
CrossFit's newly-retired five-time Fittest Man in the World, Mat Fraser, is back with another Hard Work Pays Off (#HWPO) workout from his new YouTube channel. He's previously shared six tough #HWPO workouts, as well as his experience taking Rogue's "Cliffhanger" Challenge on his channel. His latest training session comes from Week 2 of his 12 week #HWPO Program.

"The focus is on lighter weight, higher volume," says Fraser. He also posted about the workout on his Instagram.

Here's what you can expect if you want to try to take on Fraser's split. Just remember, he's training as a world-class athlete, even in retirement. So don't be hesitant to scale as needed.

**Warm Up**

(3 Rounds)

15 calorie Ski

10/10 Half-Kneeling Single-Arm Dumbbell Press

10 Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift

4 Inch Worms

"Take your time going through it, activating the right muscles," says Fraser.

**Push Press**

1 set of 10 reps at 57 percent 1RM

1 set 10 reps at 60 percent 1RM

2 sets of 8 reps at 63 percent 1RM

"These are bigger sets, and the percentages are meant to be lighter," says Fraser. "Because it's higher volume, I want the weight to stay light so you can focus on the good leg drive and generating the power out of your hips instead of just doing basically a strict press with a bit of kip. All the power should be generated from the legs."

**Strict Press**

4 sets of 10 reps at 90 percent of 10RM

"This is more volume but taking the legs out of the equations," says Fraser. "Now we're using our shoulders to press the weight up. The first set should feel easy, but by the fourth set, the reps should be slowing down."

**METCON**

Buy In

Tabata Bike (8 rounds of 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off)

**5 Rounds**

8 Sandbag Cleans

10 Burpees over Sand Bag

**Buy Out **

20/16 Assault Bike Calories

"These movements are meant to be light. You shouldn't be failing or struggling," says Fraser. "Hold a moderate pace. After this workout you should be very out of breath and fatigued."

**ACCESSORY**

4 sets of 20 Assisted Strict Pullups

5 sets of 15 Overhead Dumbbell Triceps Extension

3 sets of 15 Reverse Hyper (If you don't have a Reverse Hyper, do back extensions)

"The intent of this is big, big volume at a very light weight," says Fraser. "As you progress through the cycle, you can taper down the volume and intensity."

**BONUS WORK**

40 Minute

Spin Bike or Run in Zone 2 (145 BPM)

"This is a second session. I will go eat and kick my feet up for a little bit, then will do this session," says Fraser.Emily Shiffer

**Source: [Equipment](https://www.hwpotraining.com/programs/hwpo-pro)**
Based on the training Mat Fraser used in his years of competition, this program has evolved with the lessons he’s learned since stepping off the floor. PRO is a progression-based system designed to develop athletes and prepare them for competition — whether you’re chasing elite podiums or competing within your MASTERS division.

Track variations allow athletes to switch between OFF SEASON and COMP PREP phases to align with individual goals, while the MASTERS track provides a dedicated path tailored to the unique demands, timelines, and recovery needs of Masters athletes.
Access to a fully equipped gym and additional training facilities, such as a track and a pool, is required. Two sessions a day, each lasting 2–3 hours of training. High-volume programming for dedicated professionals, with NO MODIFYING or SCALING.

**HWPO PRO | off season**

Follow our primary track outside of competition prep to maintain and develop your elite fitness. If you need to focus on a specific weakness or have personal goals you want to achieve, our track variations are thoughtfully designed to get you where you want to be.

…

This track will follow the same progressions as HWPO PRO with increased conditioning pieces. The coaching team will adjust the training order to allow for more energy availability in the conditioning sessions. This will target the athletes who generally struggle with the longer-time domain metcons at competitions. You can also expect a reduction in the intensity (drop in percentages) and volume of strength work to allow for the aerobic focus.
**HWPO PRO | COMP PREP**

When it's time to SHOW UP and COMPETE, we've got you. Switch from our standard OFF SEASON tracks when it's time to prepare, and you'll receive training tailored to get you competition-ready.

Tailored to the demands of your target event, ensuring you develop the strength, skill, and endurance required for success. The program progresses through key training phases, refining movement efficiency, dialing in competition pacing, and exposing you to event-style workouts.

…

PRO MASTERS is a dedicated track built specifically for competitive MASTERS athletes. It follows the official Masters competition season, blending the structure and intensity of PRO with smart programming that enhances recovery, protects longevity, and sustains peak performance.

This isn’t a lighter version of PRO — it’s refined for where you are in your career. Training volume and intensity are thoughtfully adjusted, joint prep and mobility are prioritized, and movement progressions are tailored for continued strength and skill advancement.

…

OFF SEASON builds the foundation, improving weaknesses, developing strength, and maintaining fitness between competition cycles. COMP PREP turns that work into game-day performance with higher intensity, structured progressions, and event-style sessions that replicate the demands of competition.

MASTERS is a dedicated track that follows its own competition season, tailored specifically for Masters athletes. It mirrors the intent of PRO but with adjusted volume, recovery, and movement prep to support sustained performance, resilience, and longevity throughout the season.

…

**PRO: MASTERS** follows a similar adjusted structure but is designed specifically for MASTERS athletes — balancing competitive performance with smarter recovery and sustainable progression across the season.

Access to a fully equipped gym is essential. For HWPO PRO, athletes will be expected to have out of gym sessions such as trail running, hill sprints, track sessions and swim workouts.

**Source: [Training Philosophy - Pro Performance RX](https://www.properformancerx.com/athletes/programs/pro-elite/training-philosophy/)**
Proper progression is mastery of one level of development before proceeding to the next.
Principle 1 states that we should first move well, then move often.
Seek a qualitative minimum before we worry about quantities. If moving well is the standard, moving often is the foreseeable outcome.
Principle 2 directs us to protect, correct, and develop the movement of those in our care.

…

Principle 1 tells us to move well, then move often. I firmly believe this is the life lesson that nature teaches us; I see it in animals and those people who are the physically and spiritually healthiest. Principle 1 is our natural principle.
We should move well enough to respond and often enough to adapt. Moving well allows us to respond appropriately to environmental signals. It sets up the feedback that is vital for progressive movement learning. Moving often adds volume across time which allows our patterns and tissues to adapt.
We need to see movement for what it is—the most distinguishable sign of life—a true vital sign. If we look at the developmental model, we are born with mobility and earn stability. We transition from fundamental to functional movements. Even the most highly developed running and climbing skills have roots in our primal patterns.
Understanding this amazing process is understanding that movement is driven through perception and behavior.
Movement Principle 2: Protect, correct, and develop.
If we lack fundamental movements, the path to fitness and health does not begin with supplementary exercise. That is the paradigm that puts quantity before quality—it attempts to build fitness on dysfunction—it focuses on parts. The first principle has somehow been reversed—people move often and hope that moving well will just happen. It won’t. And movement problems will only get worse when compounded by frequency.
The solution is simple—we need to quit lowering fitness standards. We can meet the old ones just fine if we raise movement standards. We also need to quit focusing on parts; reductionism, the breakdown of movement into isolated segments, has not reduced our musculoskeletal injuries nor has it made us healthier or more fit.
Patterns and sequences remain the preferred mode of operation in biological organisms, and that is where our focus is.
Why does the first principle work? Why do we move? Because movement affords us opportunity. It is on the foundation of movement that development occurs through the SAID principle: Specific Adaptation to Imposed Demand.
Moving well before moving often—this order offers us the greatest exposure to opportunities and risk. Moving well before moving often also offers us the greatest adaptation to environment.

…

Nature is big and it can be harsh. Nature doesn’t stop to wait for your adaptation and development and sometimes the lessons it teaches are not survivable. The second principle requires us to develop a non-failure environment.
The SAID Principle should never be used as the sole excuse to lift more weight, run faster, climb farther, swim harder or fight bigger opponents. That thinking puts more before better.

…

Protect from opportunities that do not promote productive feedback and/or impose risk.
Correct feedback by magnifying misread obstacles within the learning path.
Develop progressions with rich sensory experience and clear, robust feedback to foster independence and productive self-regulation.
You do not move to the next level of development until you are competent and independent at your current level—and can sustain it.

…

Principle 3 is the practical principle.
Standard operating procedures and intelligent selection protect those who entrust their health and fitness to us.
But where should a system start? It should recognize that we cannot know anything without perspective—that we cannot progress without baselines. Earlier I mentioned movement as a vital sign of life, and along with blood pressure and body temperature and many others, it absolutely is.
Unlike that long list, we currently have no baseline for understanding movement as a vital sign.
If we can have a system that looks at fundamental movement patterns, we can create a baseline.
With that baseline, we can identify and demonstrate the fundamental movements that are missing, deficient or dysfunctional. If movement is below a vital sign or ability—that’s dysfunction; below an environmental standard—that’s deficiency (necessary, but not sufficient). We can communicate these states to colleagues and medical professionals in a common language that, in itself, will enforce responsibility and accountability.

## HWPO Programmes

Users of the HWPO platform can choose from five different programmes:

**HWPO** ** Flagship**

Based on the approach Fraser himself credits with his world-beating success in CrossFit.

**HWPO** ** 60 **

For those with less time to spare, think of this as a condensed version of the Flagship programme (but don’t think that means you’ll work any less hard).
**HWPO** ** PRO**

For elite CrossFit athletes, hoping to compete at the Games. We’re talking three to four hours of training a day, six days a week.

**HWPO** ** Classic **

A community-based daily workout, rather than a progressive programme. Jump in, work hard, then go about your day.
**HWPO** ** Sweat**

For anyone who wants to get a sweat on and see a nice level of progression. Minimal equipment needed, 45-minute sessions – AMRAP (as many rounds as possible) and EMOM (every minute on the minute) formats.

The following workout gives a sense of what you can expect from HWPO Sweat: a full-body muscle pump and cardio workout rolled into one.
**HWPO Sweat Workout**

The overall volume and rep counts differ greatly here, but you can expect to perform between 10 and 22-25 working sets during this portion. All of the weights for these sets are based off of 1RM percentages.

After the strength piece there is some kind of cardio element, whether in the form of a classic metcon, a dedicated rowing piece, or a dedicated Assault Bike/Echo Bike piece. These generally last between 12 and 20 minutes.

In part one we’re hitting 3 sets of 8 back squats. Athlete’s should target a load that they’re confident in for the first set and then build as they are able. In part 2 we have a total body push & total body pull in today’s workout. Athletes should target a wallball variation that allows them to finish in :60 and get straight to work on the DB. On the DB we want athletes to complete as many DB snatches as they can in about :45 before taking the time to transition back to the wallballs.

Total number of dumbbell snatches.

Wallballs | :60 or less

DB Snatch | Light to moderate

**Grip the Ground**

In both our back squats and wall balls we want to target grip and twist the ground with the feet.

**Wallballs **ReduceReps/Loading/Target

In part 1, athletes should have plenty of time to adjust weights as needed between sets if they’re paired up. Provide athletes with plenty of time to build to an appropriate working weight so that they begin their first set of 8 at the right load and not as an additional warm up set.

In part 2, if you’re short on equipment you can pair athletes up and have one group start 1:00 behind.

**Look For**

Flat feet. Look for athletes gripping the ground with the foot throughout the rep. Look for full range of motion with the athlete getting their hips below their knees each rep.

Looking for the DB to stay close to the body and to create a straight line from DB to foot once overhead. Look for good timing of legs finishing the drive & jump before the athlete pulls the DB with the arms. Post Workout Clean Up & Chat (52-60 Minutes)

Every 2 Minutes x 5 Rounds:

25 Single DB thrusters

Max Dumbbell Snatches

Switch arms however on the thrusters

“It’s not how much we give, but how much love we put into giving.” - Mother Theresa

Imagine we’re moving. And we have two friends, who both extend an offer to help.

The first friend writes us a check for 1,000 dollars to help with the moving expenses. Incredibly generous. The second friend doesn’t offer a dime, but instead comes to our old place, helps us pack up every box, drives with us to the new house, and unpacks everything with us into the early hours in the morning.

Fast forward two weeks later. Both friends call you to ask for a favor. Which friend are we more likely to help?

We would choose the second friend. But why? If we were to try to explain, we collectively would flow to the same, natural response... “Because they would have done it for me.”

Money has relative value. But time is an absolute.

If we want to make a “perishable donation”, give money.

If we want to make an everlasting impact, give time.

**Fetched: [HWPO PRO Is Not Your Average Training Program](https://thebarbellspin.com/fitness/hwpo-pro-is-not-your-average-training-program/)**
There are training programs…and then there is the HWPO PRO training program. Athletes looking to compete in the CrossFit Games season have no shortage of programs to follow these days. Programs like Mayhem Athlete, Misfit Athletics, CompTrain, Underdogs Athletics and Brute Strength send athletes under their camp to Games every year.

Now add the HWPO PRO camp. But not everyone can join. In what we believe is the first of its kind, HWPO PRO has set certain requirements needed to join.

So what are the requirements?

- Placed top 300 in Quarterfinals

- Ability to train 2 sessions per day, 3-4 hours

- 245/155 lb. Snatch

- 275/185 lb. Clean & Jerk

- 365/Upper 200’s lb. Back Squat

- 10+ Unbroken Ring Muscle-Ups

- Proficient in Handstand Walking

- Proficient in Butterfly & Chest-to-Bar Pull-ups

- Access to all machines & equipment you expect to see in competition

- Access to specialty equipment is also required such as axel bars, peg boards and various training implements such as a road bike, track and swimming pool

- No modifications or scaling

On top of that, HWPO PRO can only be joined at certain times. Right now, registration is open from October 16-23, 2022. Once registration closes, the next opportunity to join is during the Open Season cycle.

So as you can see, HWPO PRO is for serious athletes only. There is no option to follow along and just scale or modify movements.

However, if you are one a top 300 Quarterfinal athlete and want to train like Mat Fraser did, this could be the program. Plus, those in the program get access to six expert training staff members: Mat Fraser, Steven Fawcett, Rob Kearney, Aimee Anaya Everett, Jake Marconi and Harry Palley. Not a bad group of coaches…

If you’re interested, you can enter your contact information here to be notified when registration opens up.

For the rest of us, HWPO offers multiple training programs ranging from $20-40/month.
