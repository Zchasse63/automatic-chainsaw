This variable will depend on the movement, loading, rep scheme, and perhaps the gym layout, amongst other factors.\n\n\u2026\n\nStep 4: After estimating the duration of 1 round including fatigue, divide the duration of effort by the estimated time for 1 round. This will give an approximate number of rounds to be completed.\n\n**Step 4: Determine Scaling Options**\n\nAfter a workout has been programmed, the coach will need to determine scaling options. The Rx\u2019d prescription is generally based on higher-level individuals at your gym (not CrossFit Games athletes). To scale effectively, replicate as many of the workout variables as possible from the prescribed workout such as loading goals, movement functions, and time-duration goals.\n\n\u2026\n\nLoading: Moderate\n\nFormat: Triplet\n\nPriority: Task\n\n**Step 2: Program a Rough Draft of the Workout**\n\n3 rounds for time of:\n\n400-meter run\n\n21 deadlifts (185lb/135lb)\n\n12 strict handstand push-ups\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Workout and Adjust if Needed**",

          "snippet": "When I signed up for my first HYROX, I quickly realised I had no idea how to train for it! In my search for help, I discovered the Rox Lyfe training plan and I\u2019m delighted with the results. The sessions are challenging, but enjoyable and have different options for your current fitness level. The plan builds nicely over the 12 weeks and each week you dedicate a day to a HYROX style workout which is a huge confidence builder. You also get several top tips for race day which I really appreciated as a first timer! I\u2019ll definitely be using it again for my next event!\n\n\u2026\n\nAfter competing at a couple of HYROX events I felt like I needed more guidance and more structure to become a better athlete. The Rox Lyfe 12-week program delivered just that!\n\nI finished my first 12-week cycle just before Rotterdam and during this period I could really feel I was getting stronger, faster and fitter. Every training session is exciting and challenging and the Rox Lyfe guys are always there to answer questions and to motivate you. This program will definitely get you ready for your next HYROX event! So if you want to step up your HYROX game, the Rox Lyfe is the way to go!\n\n\u2026\n\nThe plan really helped me gain an understanding of how to train for HYROX, which is such a broad event.\n\nThe plan covers all the important elements, strength, running progression, HYROX specifics and compromised workouts, so nothing came as a shock or was untrained on the day.\n\nIt also helped me discover what my weaknesses were, so I could then adapt to train more on those, and less on the areas I was strong.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe plan was great and definitely helped me get HYROX ready. There were levels included which I was able to move between to ensure I was always progressing, even if I was short on time or wasn\u2019t feeling up to the most difficult workout. Really enjoyed the style of workouts and think my leg endurance has came on in leaps and bounds.\n\n\u2026\n\nI found this plan and it delivered exactly what I needed for a very reasonable price. Everything is covered; runs of differing speeds/lengths, interval training (probably the element that improved my performance the most), strength and HYROX specific simulations. It provides different levels depending on your fitness and was very easy to follow. I would highly recommend it especially as it got me through my first solo HYROX!\n\u201cA big thanks to Rox Lyfe for the 12-week training plan. It made such a difference having a structure to my training and I really enjoyed the variety of sessions. I did my 2nd and 3rd HYROX at the weekend. I was 3m 33s quicker than the Excel last year and still had plenty of energy left for the doubles on Sunday.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nThe Rox Lyfe program was everything I was looking for in a hybrid training program \u2014 thoughtful, comprehensive, challenging, and accessible to non-professional athletes. After using the program to train for my fifth individual Hyrox race, the program\u2019s impact was clear: I finished more than 5:30 faster than my previous best time, and achieved personal bests for my total run time and five of the eight workout stations. What\u2019s more, the program\u2019s inherently scalable format will allow me to revisit it in future training as I continue to progress in the sport.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe Rox Lyfe coaching team\u2019s expertise was evident in every aspect of the plan, from the pre-race tips to the detailed plan which is designed to evolve over the course of the 12 weeks. Ahead of my race Greg personally reached out to see how I was getting on with the plan which was a nice touch. After following the training programme, I went into the race confident with my fitness, and was delighted with my result. For anyone looking to eliminate guesswork from their HYROX preparation and put their trust in a programme that\u2019s easy to follow and yields results, I\u2019d highly recommend it!",

          "snippet": "Recently, people who know I work for CrossFit, LLC have asked me if I think Hyrox is the \u201cnext big thing\u201d and if it will replace CrossFit\u00ae training. It reminds me of the old days when people used to ask, \u201cWhat is CrossFit?\u201d and I\u2019d respond, \u201cHow much time do you have? Better yet, meet me at the gym tomorrow, and I\u2019ll show you.\u201d\n\nThere are a lot of angles one can look at in a discussion about CrossFit and Hyrox. This is my take.\n\nMy first thought is that comparing CrossFit and Hyrox is comparing apples to oranges.\n\n**CrossFit is a comprehensive strength and conditioning program with a distinct methodology.** We have clearly defined the three key components of that methodology:\n\n**What CrossFit is:** *constantly varied functional movements* *executed at high intensity* *.* This forms the basis of the methodology, and we define each element precisely and comprehensively.\n\n**Why CrossFit Training?** *To achieve optimal health, fitness across your lifespan. *We define fitness as work capacity across broad time and model domains, meaning CrossFit prepares an individual for the unknown and unknowable demands of life and sport. These definitions of health and fitness \u2014 which did not exist before CrossFit \u2014 are a crucial part of our methodology because they allow us to objectively measure work capacity and, therefore, fitness and **health**.\n\n**How to Train CrossFit:** *Through the activities that occur every day in garages and affiliates worldwide* \u2014 sound programming, a commitment to technique, then intensity and **threshold training**, proper nutrition, scaling, and virtuosity in coaching. Rooted in the fundamentals, the implementation of CrossFit has been eloquently summed up in \u201cWorld-Class Fitness in 100 Words:\n\n*\u201cEat meat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch, and no sugar. Keep intake to levels that will support exercise but not body fat. Practice and train major lifts: deadlift, clean, squat, presses, C&J, and snatch. Similarly, master the basics of gymnastics: pull-ups, dips, rope climb, push-ups, sit-ups, presses to handstand, pirouettes, flips, splits, and holds. Bike, run, swim, row, etc., hard and fast. Five or six days per week, mix these elements in as many combinations and patterns as creativity will allow. Routine is the enemy. Keep workouts short and intense. Regularly learn and play new sports.\u201d* *\u2014Greg Glassman, CrossFit Founder\n\n\n\nOur methodology and definitions describe who we are, what we do, and why we do it. CrossFit is a health and fitness program for life, designed to optimize our quality of life until the end.\n\n**Hyrox is not just a race**, it\u2019s a global phenomenon. The event is a spectacle, with an electrifying atmosphere of thumping music and cheering crowds. Unlike CrossFit\u2019s variance, **Hyrox races** follow a standardized format, allowing participants from any event to be ranked on global leaderboards.\n\n**The race format consists of a 1-km run, followed by a different exercise station for 8 rounds for time:**\n\n1-km run\n\n1,000-meter ski erg\n\n1-km run\n\n50-meter sled push\n\n1-km run\n\n50-meter sled pull\n\n1-km run\n\n80-meter burpee broad jump\n\n1-km run\n\n1,000-meter row\n\n1-km run\n\n200-meter farmers carry\n\n1-km run\n\n100-meter sandbag lunges\n\n1-km run\n\n100 wall-ball shots\n\nThis is one heck of a chipper! Meaning, we think of Hyrox much like we do\n\n**Murph** **,** **Clovis** **,** **Filthy Fifty**, or **Glen**.\n\nHyrox offers an Open category (what we call Rx\u2019d in CrossFit), a Pro category (Rx\u2019d+ with heavier weights), or athletes can compete with a teammate or as part of a team of four. With these options and basic movements almost anyone can do, Hyrox offers a suitable race option for everyone. We love this! Participants rave about the experience, and often come back and do it again with friends in tow. For CrossFit athletes, this race feels like home. We are no strangers to the ski erg, rower, sleds, lunges, carries, or burpee broad jumps. And we invented the wall-ball shot. The environment, the trending attire, and the community aspect are also very reminiscent of CrossFit events. This is definitely an intriguing option to add to the bucket list for testing the fitness we develop day in and day out in affiliates and garages all over the world.\n\n### CrossFit Athletes Doing Hyrox\n\nNot surprisingly, when top CrossFit athletes bring their fitness to Hyrox, they do very well. Their success in Hyrox is not just a testament to their individual abilities but also to the effectiveness of the CrossFit program. Tia-Clair Toomey-Orr \u2014 the top female CrossFit athlete of all-time with seven Fittest on Earth titles to her name \u2014 finished third in the mixed doubles category in her first Hyrox event in Melbourne with partner James Newbury, also a CrossFit Games athlete. Just three months later, the duo finished second at Hyrox Brisbane. Then, Toomey-Orr partnered with Joanna Wietrzyk (an Australian Hyrox superstar at only 22 years old) for the Elite Pro Women\u2019s Doubles division in Houston, Texas, where they\n\n**set a new world record**.\n\nOther CrossFit Games athletes, such as current champion\n\n**James Sprague**, two-time Games champ Justin Medeiros, and Chandler Smith, have all produced excellent performances in their first attempts at Hyrox. With the popularity of Hyrox growing, affiliates have been signing athletes up for races as a fun community event, and these athletes also perform very well.\n\n**Does this mean CrossFit and Hyrox are the same? No. It means CrossFit prepares people for Hyrox incredibly well.** Hyrox movements are well-known and well-practiced by CrossFit athletes. Mixed modality training \u2014 monostructural, gymnastics, and weightlifting movements combined in one workout \u2014 is a CrossFit hallmark. CrossFit develops all metabolic pathways, allowing our athletes to show repeated bouts of high-power output (burpee broad jumps, wall-ball shots, and lunges), sustained intensity in high-glycolytic events (ski erg, row, sled push/pull, farmers carry) while having the aerobic capacity to endure through a race that lasts approximately an hour. What we\u2019re seeing from our top CrossFit athletes as they test their fitness in Hyrox events is a confirmation of the elite level of fitness they can bring to this sport.\n\n### Training For Hyrox\n\nThe question often asked is, \u201cIs CrossFit all I need to do to train for a Hyrox event?\u201d The short answer is yes. If the goal is to do a Hyrox event for fun or as a test to see what we can do without any specialized training, the best approach is to follow our regular workout regimen and show up on race day to throw down. Just like we don\u2019t do specific training for Murph or Glen, we can show up at a Hyrox event as if it were another WOD. And from what we\u2019ve heard from local affiliates, we\u2019ll do pretty well, finishing anywhere from the top half to the top third of the participants or teams in the Open category.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the goal becomes excelling at Hyrox and vying for titles, then the broad, general, and inclusive fitness base we get from CrossFit, along with the familiarity with the movements, is an excellent starting point that will need to be augmented with event-specific preparation \u2014 just as we would expect of sport-specific athletes who play basketball, tennis, or soccer or who run, ski, or bike. Such specialized training for a Hyrox event might look like this:\n\n**Maintain CrossFit Training:**Athletes should continue their regular CrossFit workouts three to four times a week to maintain a high level of **general physical preparedness**(GPP). **Identify Weaknesses:**Athletes should assess their capacity for the running and movement stations to identify their areas of weakness. **Targeted Training:**Athletes can incorporate focused skill work before or after their CrossFit workouts to **target**weaknesses. **Increase Specificity Over Time:**Twelve weeks from the event, athletes should continue CrossFit while dedicating one longer-duration weekly workout to simulate Hyrox\u2019s movements and format. Six weeks out, they\u2019ll shift toward more event-specific training with increased running volume and longer workouts while reducing pure CrossFit volume. The final two weeks should focus on tapering intensity with one to two CrossFit sessions and three to four Hyrox-style weekly sessions.\n\nIn other words, to crush a Hyrox event, apply the principles of mechanics, consistency, and intensity in CrossFit and to that workout, and you\u2019ll do far better than most.\n\nThis approach is effective not only for Hyrox but also for any sport where CrossFit serves as the foundation for\n\n**GPP**.\n\nUltimately, CrossFit\u2019s methodology provides a comprehensive base of fitness that can prepare athletes for nearly any challenge. However, targeting any of the eight Hyrox disciplines where an athlete may be weak and upping the running volume for four to six weeks before the event are essential for optimal results when the goal is the highest placement possible at a specific race.\n\n### CROSSFIT AND HYROX: BEYOND US vs. THEM\n\nWe\u2019ve covered a lot of ground here, but circling back to the original question, I do not see Hyrox replacing CrossFit. Hyrox simply does not fulfill the same purpose as CrossFit. CrossFit is a strength and conditioning program, a lifestyle, designed to build work capacity across as broad a spectrum of physical qualities as possible so we can overcome as many physical challenges or adventures as possible, move all our health metrics in the right direction, battle chronic disease, and enjoy the highest quality of life possible for our entire lifespan.\n\n**Optimal health is the need CrossFit satisfies.** That\u2019s what we were built for.\n\n**Hyrox involves a race, a single event,** and it has never claimed to produce the depth and breadth of adaptation to deliver on health the way CrossFit does.\n\nCan someone get very fit training for Hyrox? Absolutely. But not as fit as a CrossFit athlete by OUR definition of work capacity across broad time and modal domains. CrossFit is the gold standard for developing health and fitness. Hyrox is an entertaining, emerging sport, and it\u2019s fun to watch as a cadre of professional athletes push for incredible times. It is also a well-organized, exciting, unique, and extremely challenging race perfectly suited for testing a CrossFit athlete\u2019s fitness.\n\nCrossFit and Hyrox both bring unique strengths and offerings to the industry. However, rather than solely focusing on rivalry, which the media prefers, we can both thrive independently while serving our distinct missions. Furthermore, our competition in the marketplace doesn\u2019t prevent us from recognizing that diverse training options ultimately benefit athletes and strengthen the fitness community as a whole.\n\n## About the Author\n\nStephane Rochet is a Senior Content Writer for CrossFit.

          "snippet": "# How to Structure Your HYROX Running Training (Science-Backed Weekly Plan)\n\nIf you're training for HYROX, you've probably heard conflicting advice about running. Some say \"just run more miles.\" Others swear by high-intensity intervals. Most HYROX athletes end up stuck in the middle\u2014running too hard to build aerobic capacity but not hard enough to improve VO\u2082 max.\n\nThe solution?\n\n**Polarized training**: one long slow run, one tempo session, and one high-intensity interval workout per week. This isn't just bro-science\u2014it's backed by decades of endurance research and used by Olympic athletes across every endurance sport.\n\nIn this article, we'll break down the scientific evidence, show you exactly how to structure your weekly running, and explain why this approach delivers 3x better results than traditional training methods.\n\n## The Science: Why Polarized Training Works for HYROX\n\n### What is Polarized Training?\n\nPolarized training, pioneered by exercise physiologist Dr. Stephen Seiler, is built on a simple principle:\n\n**80% of your training should be easy (Zone 2), and 20% should be hard (Zone 4-5)**. The middle ground\u2014tempo pace (Zone 3)\u2014is minimized.\n\nThis directly contradicts traditional threshold training, where athletes spend 40-50% of their time at moderate intensity. Research consistently shows polarized training produces superior results.\n\n### The Research Evidence\n\n**Study #1: Seiler & Kjerland (2006)** analyzed the training intensity distribution of World and Olympic Champion endurance athletes across multiple sports. Their finding? Elite athletes spend approximately **75-80% of training time at low intensity**, despite racing at much higher intensities[^1].\n\n**Study #2: Helgerud et al. (2007)** compared four training protocols over 8 weeks:\n\n- Long slow distance only:\n\n**3.5% VO\u2082 max improvement**\n\n- Continuous moderate intensity:\n\n**5.2% VO\u2082 max improvement**\n\n- 4\u00d74 minute intervals at 90-95% max HR:\n\n**10.8% VO\u2082 max improvement**\n\nThe interval group showed\n\n**nearly 3x greater improvement** than continuous training[^2].\n\n**Study #3: St\u00f6ggl & Sperlich (2014)** directly compared polarized vs. threshold training in runners. After 9 weeks, the polarized group showed superior improvements in:\n\n- 10km time trial performance\n\n- VO\u2082 max\n\n- Running economy\n\n- Lactate threshold\n\nThe threshold group actually experienced decreased performance in some metrics[^3].\n\n*The 80/20 rule: Polarized training (right) produces better results than traditional threshold training (left)*\n\n## Understanding the Three Training Zones\n\nBefore we dive into weekly structure, let's clarify what each training zone actually does for your HYROX performance.\n\n### Zone 2: Low-Intensity Aerobic Training (80% of volume)\n\n**Heart Rate:** 60-70% of max HR\n\n**Talk Test:** Full conversation possible\n\n**Duration:** 60-90 minutes\n\n**Frequency:** 1-2x per week for HYROX\n\n**What it does:**\n\n- Increases mitochondrial density (your cellular power plants)\n\n- Improves fat oxidation (preserves glycogen for stations)\n\n- Builds capillary networks (better oxygen delivery)\n\n- Strengthens slow-twitch muscle fibers\n\n- Enhances recovery capacity\n\n**HYROX benefit:** You recover faster between stations and maintain pace through all 8km of running. This is your aerobic engine\u2014the foundation everything else is built on.\n\n**Common mistake:** Running Zone 2 too hard. If you can't hold a conversation, you're in Zone 3 (the \"gray zone\") and missing the adaptations. **Slow down**.\n\n### Tempo Training: Lactate Threshold Work (~5% of volume)\n\n**Heart Rate:** 75-85% of max HR\n\n**Talk Test:** Short sentences only (3-5 words)\n\n**Duration:** 20-40 minutes at tempo pace\n\n**Frequency:** 1x per week\n\n**What it does:**\n\n- Raises lactate threshold (push harder before fatigue)\n\n- Improves lactate clearance\n\n- Teaches your body to maintain hard efforts\n\n- Mental toughness at race pace\n\n**HYROX benefit:** This is closest to your average HYROX running pace between stations. You're training your body to sustain that \"comfortably hard\" pace for the entire race.\n\n**Common mistake:** Going too hard and turning tempo into an interval session. Tempo should be steady and sustainable for 20-40 minutes\u2014not all-out.\n\n### High-Intensity Intervals: VO\u2082 Max Training (~15% of volume)\n\n**Heart Rate:** 90-95% of max HR\n\n**Talk Test:** 1-2 words maximum\n\n**Duration:** 3-5 minutes per interval, 4-8 intervals\n\n**Frequency:** 1x per week\n\n**What it does:**\n\n- Maximal VO\u2082 max improvements\n\n- Increases stroke volume (heart pumps more blood per beat)\n\n- Improves oxygen extraction by muscles\n\n- Raises ceiling on all other training\n\n**HYROX benefit:** When you hit that brutal Wall Ball station after 8km of running, your VO\u2082 max determines how well you perform under extreme fatigue. Higher VO\u2082 max = better oxygen delivery when you need it most.\n\n**Common mistake:** Not going hard enough. Intervals should be genuinely uncomfortable. If you can chat during the work portion, increase intensity.\n\n*Research shows 4\u00d74 minute intervals produce 3x greater VO\u2082 max improvements than steady-state training*\n\n## Your Weekly HYROX Running Structure\n\nHere's how to put it all together: 3 running sessions + 2 HYROX strength sessions per week.\n\n*Optimal weekly structure balancing intensity, volume, and recovery*\n\n### Monday: Zone 2 Long Run (60-90 minutes)\n\n**Purpose:** Build aerobic base and fat oxidation\n\n**Intensity:** 60-70% max HR (conversational pace)\n\n**Structure:**\n\n- 10 min easy warm-up\n\n- 40-70 min Zone 2 effort\n\n- 10 min easy cool-down\n\n**Why Monday?** You're fresh from weekend rest. Long runs require mental focus\u2014do them when you're sharp.\n\n**Progression:** Add 5-10 minutes every 2-3 weeks until you hit 90 minutes. Don't exceed 90 minutes\u2014this isn't marathon training.\n\n**Pro tip:** Practice race nutrition during long runs. Eat/drink at the same intervals you'll use in HYROX. Learn what your stomach can handle at this effort.\n\n### Tuesday: HYROX Strength Training\n\n**Purpose:** Train the 8 stations while legs are still fresh from easy Zone 2 run\n\n**Structure:**\n\n- Choose 4-6 stations per session\n\n- 2-3 rounds at race weight\n\n- Focus on technique and power\n\n- Short transition runs between stations\n\nSee our complete HYROX training guide for station-specific workouts.\n\n**Why Tuesday?** Your legs aren't fatigued from Zone 2 (it's aerobic, not damaging). You can train stations with good quality.\n\n### Wednesday: Tempo Run (20-40 minutes)\n\n**Purpose:** Raise lactate threshold\n\n**Intensity:** 75-85% max HR\n\n**Structure:**\n\n- 10 min easy warm-up\n\n- 20-40 min tempo (should feel \"comfortably hard\")\n\n- 10 min easy cool-down\n\n**How it should feel:** You're pushing, but could theoretically hold this pace for an hour. Not all-out, but definitely working.\n\n**Progression:**\n\n- Weeks 1-4: 20 minutes tempo\n\n- Weeks 5-8: 25-30 minutes tempo\n\n- Weeks 9-12: 30-40 minutes tempo\n\n**HYROX connection:** This pace is typically your average running pace between HYROX stations. You're teaching your body to sustain race effort.\n\n### Thursday: Rest or Easy Recovery\n\n**Purpose:** Prepare for Friday's high-intensity intervals\n\n**Options:**\n\n- Complete rest (recommended for most)\n\n- 20-30 min very easy recovery jog\n\n- Light mobility and stretching\n\n- Easy swimming or cycling\n\n**Why Thursday?** You need to be fresh for Friday's intervals. Tempo on Wednesday is demanding, and intervals on Friday are brutal. Rest here is strategic.\n\n**Key:** Don't skip this. Going into intervals fatigued ruins the session quality and increases injury risk.\n\n### Friday: High-Intensity Intervals\n\n**Purpose:** Maximize VO\u2082 max\n\n**Intensity:** 90-95% max HR\n\n**Structure:**\n\n- 10-15 min easy warm-up\n\n- 4-6 strides (20 sec accelerations)\n\n- Main set: 4-8 \u00d7 3-4 min hard / 2-3 min easy jog recovery\n\n- 10 min easy cool-down\n\n**The Magic Protocol:** Research by Helgerud et al. showed **4 \u00d7 4 minutes at 90-95% max HR** with 3-minute active recovery produced the greatest VO\u2082 max improvements[^2].\n\n**Progression:**\n\n- Weeks 1-4: 4 \u00d7 3 min (90% HR)\n\n- Weeks 5-8: 6 \u00d7 3 min (92% HR)\n\n- Weeks 9-12: 4-6 \u00d7 4 min (90-95% HR)\n\n**Pro tip:** Track your heart rate recovery. If HR doesn't drop below 65% during rest intervals, you're not recovered enough. Extend rest or reduce interval length.\n\n**Why Friday?** You're fresh from Thursday's rest, so you can push maximum intensity. Weekend recovery follows.\n\n### Saturday: HYROX Strength Training\n\n**Purpose:** Train the 8 stations with race-specific focus\n\n**Intensity:** Moderate-high (you're fatigued from the week, but stations need work)\n\n**Structure:**\n\n- Choose 4-6 stations per session\n\n- 2-3 rounds at race weight\n\n- Focus on technique under fatigue\n\n- Include short transition runs between stations\n\nSee our complete HYROX training guide for station-specific workouts.\n\n**Why Saturday?** You've already done your hardest running for the week. Saturday station work simulates race conditions\u2014training stations when you're already fatigued from running.\n\n**Progression:** Rotate stations each week to ensure you hit all 8 over a 2-week cycle.\n\n### Sunday: Complete Rest\n\n**Purpose:** Full recovery before the cycle repeats\n\n**Activity:** Nothing structured. Walk, light mobility, enjoy life.\n\n**Why it matters:** Growth happens during rest. You have two hard running days (Wednesday + Friday) and two strength days (Tuesday + Saturday) in the week. Full rest on Sunday lets you start Monday's long run fresh.\n\n## Common Questions & Mistakes\n\n### \"Can I add more running?\"\n\n**No.** More is not better\u2014better is better. The 80/20 distribution works because it allows quality in your high-intensity sessions. Add more volume, and you'll be too fatigued to hit proper intensities on interval day.\n\nIf you're coming from a pure running background, you might feel like this isn't enough mileage. Remember: HYROX adds 8 brutal station workouts on top of the running. Train smarter, not just harder.\n\n### \"What if I can't run 90 minutes?\"\n\nStart where you are. If 40 minutes is your current long run, that's fine. Add 5-10 minutes every 2-3 weeks. The principles remain the same regardless of your current fitness level.\n\n### \"Can I do two interval sessions per week?\"\n\nOnly if you're an advanced athlete with 5+ years of structured endurance training. For most HYROX competitors, two high-intensity running sessions plus station training equals overtraining.\n\nThe research is clear: more intensity doesn't equal more improvement. It equals injury and burnout.\n\n### \"Why not just do HYROX classes for all my training?\"\n\nMost HYROX gym classes are Zone 3-4 (\"gray zone\") work\u2014too hard to build aerobic capacity, not hard enough to maximize VO\u2082 max. They're great for technique and fun, but shouldn't replace structured running training.\n\nUse HYROX classes for station practice 1-2x/week, but do your running separately where you can control intensity precisely.\n\n## The Gray Zone Problem\n\nThe biggest mistake HYROX athletes make? Spending too much time in Zone 3 (70-80% max HR). It feels like you're working hard, so it must be effective, right?\n\n**Wrong.**\n\nZone 3 provides enough stress to create fatigue but not enough stimulus to drive adaptations. You're too tired to recover properly, but not training intensely enough to improve VO\u2082 max. It's the worst of both worlds.\n\nResearch by Seiler showed that elite athletes actively avoid Zone 3, except for occasional tempo sessions. They go easy or go hard\u2014nothing in between[^1].\n\n**Signs you're stuck in the gray zone:**\n\n- Always moderately tired\n\n- Plateaued performance despite training consistently\n\n- Can't hit target paces on interval days\n\n- Poor recovery between sessions\n\n- Declining motivation\n\n**The fix:** Slow down your easy days. Speed up your hard days. Trust the polarization.\n\n## Measuring Your Training Zones\n\nYou need objective feedback. \"Feel\" is too subjective, especially as fitness improves.\n\n### Option 1: Heart Rate Training (Recommended)\n\n**Find your max HR:**\n\n- Method 1: 220 - age (rough estimate)\n\n- Method 2: Field test (warm up, then run 4 min all-out uphill\u2014your max HR at end is ~max)\n\n- Method 3: Lab test (most accurate, but unnecessary for most athletes)\n\n**Calculate zones:**\n\n- Zone 2: 60-70% of max HR\n\n- Tempo: 75-85% of max HR\n\n- Intervals: 90-95% of max HR\n\n**Best devices:** Chest strap HR monitors (Polar H10, Garmin HRM-Pro) are more accurate than wrist-based.\n\n### Option 2: Talk Test (Free)\n\n**Zone 2:**Full conversation possible **Tempo:**Short sentences (3-5 words) **Intervals:**1-2 words maximum\n\nSurprisingly accurate when used honestly.\n\n### Option 3: Power (Advanced)\n\nRunning power meters (Stryd) provide the most precise training feedback but require investment and learning curve.\n\n## Adapting for Different Experience Levels\n\n### Beginner (First HYROX or under 1 year endurance training)\n\n**Weekly Structure:**\n\n- Long Run: 40-60 min\n\n- Tempo: 20 min\n\n- Intervals: 4 \u00d7 3 min\n\n- Total: 2-3 runs/week + 2 HYROX strength sessions\n\n**Focus:** Build consistent training habit. Master Zone 2 pacing (most beginners run this too hard).\n\n### Intermediate (2-3 HYROX races, 1-3 years training)\n\n**Weekly Structure:**\n\n- Long Run: 60-75 min\n\n- Tempo: 25-30 min\n\n- Intervals: 5-6 \u00d7 3-4 min\n\n- Total: 3-4 runs/week + 2 HYROX sessions\n\n**Focus:** Precise execution of intensities. Track data. Build consistency.\n\n### Advanced (Multiple podiums, 3+ years structured training)\n\n**Weekly Structure:**\n\n- Long Run: 75-90 min\n\n- Tempo: 30-40 min\n\n- Intervals: 6-8 \u00d7 4 min or specialized workouts\n\n- Total: 4-5 runs/week + 2-3 HYROX sessions\n\n**Focus:** Periodization, race-specific work, fine-tuning weaknesses.\n\n## Sample 12-Week Progression\n\n### Weeks 1-4: Base Building\n\n- Long Run: 40 \u2192 50 \u2192 60 \u2192 65 min\n\n- Tempo: 20 min steady\n\n- Intervals: 4 \u00d7 3 min\n\n**Focus:** Establish Zone 2 discipline, build volume progressively.\n\n### Weeks 5-8: Build Phase\n\n- Long Run: 70 \u2192 75 \u2192 80 \u2192 75 min\n\n- Tempo: 25 \u2192 30 \u2192 30 \u2192 25 min\n\n- Intervals: 5 \u00d7 3 min \u2192 6 \u00d7 3 min \u2192 5 \u00d7 4 min \u2192 4 \u00d7 4 min\n\n**Focus:** Increase intensity on hard days while maintaining easy days easy.\n\n### Weeks 9-10: Race Simulation\n\n- Long Run: 60-70 min + race-pace pickups\n\n- Tempo: 25-30 min at goal race pace\n\n- Intervals: 4-6 \u00d7 4 min with full recovery\n\n**Focus:** Practice race-specific efforts, nail pacing.\n\n### Weeks 11-12: Taper\n\n- Reduce volume by 40-50%\n\n- Maintain intensity on 1 interval session (4 \u00d7 3 min)\n\n- Extra rest\n\n**Focus:** Arrive fresh. Trust the training.\n\n## Integration with HYROX Station Training\n\nYour complete weekly schedule might look like:\n\n**Monday:**Zone 2 Long Run **Tuesday:**HYROX Strength (stations) **Wednesday:**Tempo Run **Thursday:**Rest or easy recovery **Friday:**Interval Running **Saturday:**HYROX Strength (stations) **Sunday:**Complete Rest\n\nNotice the alternating pattern between running and strength. This prevents overloading the same energy systems consecutive days.\n\nFor detailed HYROX station training, see our complete training plan and station performance analysis.\n\n## Tracking Progress\n\nMeasure these metrics every 4 weeks:\n\n**1. Zone 2 Drift Test**\n\n- Run 60 min Zone 2 (constant HR)\n\n- Track pace every 10 min\n\n- Less pace drift = better aerobic fitness\n\n**2. Threshold Pace**\n\n- 20-30 min time trial at tempo effort\n\n- Average pace = your current threshold\n\n- Should improve 5-10 sec/km every 4-8 weeks\n\n**3. Interval Power**\n\n- Track average pace on 4 \u00d7 4 min intervals\n\n- Consistent improvement = training is working\n\n**4. RHR (Resting Heart Rate)**\n\n- Measure upon waking\n\n- Declining RHR = improving fitness\n\n- Elevated RHR = check recovery/stress\n\nDon't obsess over daily fluctuations. Look for trends over 4-week blocks.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nPolarized training isn't new or revolutionary\u2014it's what elite endurance athletes have done for decades. The research is overwhelming:\n\n\n\n**80% Zone 2 + 20% High Intensity beats threshold training**\n\n\n\n**4 \u00d7 4 min intervals produce 3x greater VO\u2082 max gains**\n\n\n\n**One long run, one tempo, one interval session per week is optimal for HYROX**\n\nStop training in the gray zone. Go easy when it's easy. Go hard when it's hard. Trust the science.\n\nYour HYROX performance will thank you.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Q: How long does it take to see improvements from polarized training?**\n\nA: Most athletes notice improvements within 4-6 weeks. Significant VO\u2082 max gains appear after 8-10 weeks of consistent training. Remember: fitness is built in months and years, not weeks.\n\n**Q: Can I do all my running on a treadmill?**\n\nA: Yes, but vary the incline to better simulate HYROX race conditions. Set treadmill to 1-2% incline for \"flat\" running to account for lack of air resistance.\n\n**Q: What if I miss a workout?**\n\nA: Skip it and move on. Don't try to \"make up\" missed sessions\u2014this disrupts the training pattern. Consistency over perfection.\n\n**Q: Should I do strength training before or after running?**\n\nA: Ideally separate them by 6+ hours. If you must combine, do the priority workout first. On tempo/interval days, running comes first.\n\n**Q: How much does running contribute to HYROX success?**\n\nA: Running is 40-50% of your race time. You can't win HYROX with running alone, but poor running will definitely cost you. Master both.\n\n**Q: What about doubles (two sessions per day)?**\n\nA: Only for advanced athletes with 10+ hours/week to train. Most HYROX competitors don't need doubles and risk overtraining.\n\n**Related Articles:**\n\n",

          "snippet": "December 4, 2025\n\nHYROX has exploded into one of the most exciting endurance events on the planet: a mix of running, functional strength, and pure grit.\n\nBut training for it? That\u2019s a different beast.\n\nBalancing speed, recovery, and strength endurance isn\u2019t easy, especially if you\u2019re doing it solo or without a dedicated coach.\n\nThat\u2019s where technology steps in.\n\nToday\u2019s HYROX athletes aren\u2019t just logging miles - they\u2019re using smart training apps that track pacing, monitor recovery, correct form, and even simulate race intensity. Whether you\u2019re chasing a sub-60 finish or just trying to survive your first Open division, the right app can completely change how you prepare.\n\nIn this guide, we\u2019ve rounded up the\n\n**five best apps for HYROX athletes in 2025** - from advanced AI-powered trainers to no-frills conditioning tools.\n\nLeading the list is\n\n**Chairon**, a next-generation AI training app that gives real-time feedback, personalized programming, and HYROX-specific workouts designed to push you past your limits.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the full list and see which app best fits your training style.\n\n**Why it's on the list: **ChAIron stands out as the gold-standard AI training companion for serious HYROX competitors.\n\nUnlike generic fitness apps, ChAIron delivers hyper-personalized real-time AI coaching that simultaneously corrects your form, counts reps, adjusts workout intensity, and simulates race conditions, all without requiring additional wearables.\n\nThe result?\n\nAthletes using ChAIron report 30-40% better race-day pacing accuracy, dramatically improved form consistency, and faster mental adaptation to race intensity.\n\nIt's the only app on the market that offers this level of personalized, real-time feedback in an integrated ecosystem.\n\nCompetitive HYROX athletes, coaches, and performance-obsessed trainers who demand the highest level of personalization and real-time feedback. ChAIron is ideal for serious racers training for podium placements who want to eliminate guesswork and maximize the effectiveness of every workout. If you're willing to invest in premium AI coaching and want a scientifically-backed approach to training optimization.\n\nChAIron is the clear #1 choice.\n\nLEVLS is an official HYROX training partner with a structured, methodology-driven approach. The app delivers solid HYROX-specific programming with reliable training blocks and performance tracking. It's a dependable choice for athletes seeking guided, proven programming, though it relies on pre-set routines rather than adaptive, real-time personalization.\n\nBest for: Athletes who prefer structured, pre-planned programming and don't need real-time form corrections or adaptive difficulty. LEVLS works well if you already have a solid training foundation and want official HYROX-curated workouts with built-in consistency checks. However, if you're seeking personalized, on-the-fly coaching adjustments, you may find a more adaptive app, such as ChAIron, better suited to your needs.\n\n**Why it's on the list: **Centr takes a broader, holistic approach to HYROX training, integrating certified race-specific programs with nutrition, recovery, and mindset coaching. It's an official HYROX partner offering solid structure across multiple training pillars, though as a generalist platform, it doesn't provide the real-time, movement-by-movement form correction or adaptive intensity adjustments that specialized HYROX apps deliver.\n\nAthletes seeking a comprehensive, all-in-one platform that bundles training, nutrition, recovery and mindset guidance. Centr works well if you want to address fitness holistically and don't require real-time, movement-specific form corrections. It's excellent for managing multiple training dimensions, but lacks the specialized AI-driven personalization that dedicated HYROX platforms provide.\n\nHyrox Workouts \u2013 Fitness Race provides an affordable, lightweight option for HYROX-style training with functional movement patterns, EMOMs, AMRAPs and structured race-prep workouts. It's a good entry-level choice for athletes on a budget, though it lacks the personalized AI coaching, real-time form feedback, and adaptive progression that more advanced platforms deliver.\n\nBudget-conscious beginners or casual athletes seeking affordable HYROX-style workouts without personalized coaching. Hyrox Workouts is ideal for those starting their fitness journey or training offline. However, if you need form analysis, real-time feedback, adaptive intensity, or comprehensive coaching, higher-tier apps offer significantly more advanced capabilities.\n\nRoxFit functions as a workout tracker and log with HYROX-friendly programming options. It serves athletes who want to document their training and access pre-built workouts. While useful for tracking, RoxFit is primarily data-focused and lacks the AI-powered coaching, real-time form analysis, and adaptive intelligence that modern training apps provide.\n\nSelf-directed athletes with strong movement knowledge who primarily value workout logging and data analysis over personalized coaching. RoxFit works well for experienced trainers building custom workouts. For anyone seeking real-time coaching, adaptive programming, or movement-specific form guidance, dedicated coaching platforms offer substantially more value.\n\nChAIron is the only app that combines AI coaching, real-time form feedback, and adaptive difficulty training: three critical features that separate serious HYROX racers from the rest. If you're training for a race where every second counts, static training plans won't cut it. You need intelligent coaching that evolves with your performance, corrects your form before it causes injury, and optimizes your pacing to hit your target time. Don't just train harder. Train smarter. Start your ChAIron training today and experience the 30-40% accuracy improvement that comes from AI-powered race pacing. Your PR is waiting.\n\n",

          "snippet": "After diving into his first HYROX competition in Las Vegas with little to no prep, five-time CrossFit Games Champion Mat Fraser is now taking a more strategic approach.\n\nIn a recent Youtube video, Fraser revealed how he\u2019s ramping up efforts to get ready for the next HYROX event happening this November in Chicago.\n\nWhether you\u2019re brand new to the functional fitness race format or looking to refine your performance, there are serious takeaways from Fraser\u2019s renewed training strategy \u2014 from smart interval structures to balancing fitness goals with real life.\n\nHere\u2019s how he\u2019s preparing and how you can apply his insights to your own HYROX journey.\n\nJump to:\n\n- From Casual Entry to Committed Return\n\n- What Fraser\u2019s HYROX Training Looks Like Now\n\n- Why Running Is the Priority\n\n- Building a Community Around the Event\n\n- HYROX Tips for Beginners\n\n- Balancing Competition with Real Life\n\n- The Bottom Line\n\n## From Casual Entry to Committed Return\n\nFraser\u2019s first HYROX event in Vegas was more about checking it off the list than chasing a podium finish.\n\n\u201cNext to zero prep going into it,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI just wanted to enjoy my time with my friend and just complete it, see what it was all about.\u201d\n\nBut watching the elite athletes compete lit a spark. \u201cIt makes you want to be like: \u2018Let\u2019s see what I can do,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nNow, with a dedicated date in mind for Chicago, the goal has shifted \u2014 not to win, but to improve. \u201cI want to push the pace. I want to make it challenging. I want to run faster than I did last time.\u201d\n\n## What Fraser\u2019s HYROX Training Looks Like Now\n\nFraser\u2019s current training is practical, flexible, and focused on the fundamentals. With cold winter conditions in Vermont limiting his running earlier in the year, he\u2019s shifted outdoors. One of his go-to sessions? Hill sprints around his property mixed with HYROX movements.\n\n### Sample Training Circuit\n\n- 800m run (up and down the driveway)\n\n- Rowing interval\n\n- 800m run\n\n- Rest\n\n- 800m run\n\n- SkiErg interval\n\n- 800m run\n\n- Rest\n\n- 800m run\n\n- Wall balls\n\n- 800m run\n\n\u201cThe driveway is steep,\u201d Fraser said. \u201cYou question your fitness on the way up.\u201d\n\n### Interval-Based Workouts\n\nHe structures his training sessions around 10-minute intervals: \u201cRun, row, then go again at the top of the next 10-minute mark.\u201d\n\nThis keeps things efficient and repeatable \u2014 which is key when balancing life and fatherhood.\n\n## Why Running Is the Priority\n\nFraser emphasized that despite being comfortable with the movements from his CrossFit background, running was where he struggled most.\n\n\u201cThe stations I was keeping up just fine. But on the running, there were a couple times I was like, \u2018O\u2019Keefe, chill.\u2019\u201d He jokingly blames Matt O\u2019Keefe\u2019s lanky stride, but points out the reality: running is the largest component of HYROX.\n\nThe HYROX format includes eight 1,000-meter runs, broken up by workout stations. That adds up to 8 kilometers of running, and a total time domain of roughly 90 minutes.\n\n### Fraser\u2019s Running Strategy\n\nHe plans to structure running workouts similarly to how he trained for the CrossFit Games:\n\n**Zone 2 sessions**(long and slow for aerobic capacity) **Track intervals**(like 400m and 800m repeats with rest) **Sprint sessions**(for explosive speed and force)\n\nDuring peak Games training, Fraser was running a minimum of three times a week, often supplemented with long, low-intensity bike sessions to lower impact.\n\n## Building a Community Around the Event\n\nOne of Fraser\u2019s biggest motivations for HYROX Chicago isn\u2019t a podium \u2014 it\u2019s the community. His brand, HWPO (Hard Work Pays Off), is planning to bring a big group along.\n\n\u201cThe first one was super fun, especially internally, with our whole team there,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that we know what the event looks like, it\u2019s about mass participation. Let\u2019s get a huge collection of people together and just have a good time.\u201d\n\nFor Fraser, HYROX is becoming less about peak performance and more about shared challenge. His training sessions reflect that, often linking up with friends at 5:30 a.m. to exercise before their workday begins.\n\n## HYROX Tips for Beginners\n\nFraser shared advice for anyone new to HYROX or functional fitness racing:\n\n### 1. Learn the Format\n\n\u201cGet familiar with what the eight stations are. Learn the movement standards and become proficient in them,\u201d said Fraser.\n\nThe standard HYROX race consists of running and stations in this order:\n\n- 1,000m Run\n\n- 1,000m SkiErg\n\n- 1,000m Run\n\n- 50m Sled Push\n\n- 1,000m Run\n\n- 50m Sled Pull\n\n- 1,000m Run\n\n- 80m Burpee Broad Jumps\n\n- 1,000m Run\n\n- 1,000m Row\n\n- 1,000m Run\n\n- 200m Farmer\u2019s Carry\n\n- 1,000m Run\n\n- 100m Sandbag Lunges\n\n- 1,000m Run\n\n- 75 or 100 Wall Balls\n\n### 2. Prioritize Running\n\nIf you\u2019re comfortable with most CrossFit movements, then running should be priority one.\n\n\u201cStart with a ton of Zone 2 work, then introduce interval sessions,\u201d Fraser advised. \u201cYou don\u2019t get better at running 8K by doing 8K every day. Use the same strategy you\u2019d use for one-mile training. Mix 400s, 800s, even 1,200s. Build up capacity.\u201d\n\n### 3. Train for Duration\n\nWith total HYROX completion times lasting over an hour, Fraser recommends getting used to working in that time frame.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking at 90 minutes of continuous work,\u201d he said. \u201cSo prep for that.\u201d\n\n## Balancing Competition with Real Life\n\nFraser no longer structures his whole life around elite training. With a second baby on the way and a business to run, he\u2019s intentional with his time. That means early hours, flexible planning, and workouts that fit life \u2014 not the other way around.\n\nStill, the competitive spirit is alive. Watching the pros in Vegas reignited some fire: \u201cYou see people going full speed, and it makes you think \u2014 maybe I could give more.\u201d\n\nBut full tilts days? Not likely. \u201cI\u2019ve already tested myself to the limit. My fitness has different priorities now.\u201d\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nMat Fraser\u2019s return to HYROX offers a masterclass in practical training. He\u2019s proving that improvement doesn\u2019t always require maximum effort \u2014 just consistency, purpose, and a strong support system.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a beginner considering your first race or a CrossFit athlete transitioning into the HYROX format, Fraser\u2019s approach is proof that you can balance challenge and lifestyle \u2014 and still set new personal records along the way.\n\nChicago, here they come.\n\n",

          "snippet": "For the Persist program through Functional Bodybuilding, I used the online program for three months and played around with two of the five tracks you can choose from.\n\nFunctional Bodybuilding Persist\n\n### Functional Bodybuilding Persist Program\n\n### Product Highlights\n\n- Online strength training programming\n\n- 5 different tracks to choose from\n\n- Vast library of demo videos\n\n- Community board\n\n- Weekly message from Marcus Philly\n\n### Pros & Cons\n\n#### Pros\n\n- Clear instruction\n\n- Quality demo videos\n\n- Weekly emails to overview programming\n\n- Includes quality warm-ups\n\n- Mobility days worked into schedule\n\n#### Cons\n\n- Website platform, no app\n\n- Not suited for beginners\n\n- 4-5 lifting days might not work for everyone\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nThe Functional Bodybuilding Persist Program designed by Marcus Filly, former CrossFit games athlete, offers exceptional programming for folks looking to improve mobility and increase muscle mass at the same time. Mobility and recovery is built-in to the warm-ups, cool-downs, and addressed on non-lifting days. It\u2019s also appropriate for folks with limited equipment. There are five different tracks you can choose from and one offers minimal or no equipment and you can still see results.\n\n\u2026\n\nSpeaking as a personal trainer, I would highly recommend this program (specifically the Minimalist and Pillars tracks) if you have some (or a lot of) experience with free weights and barbell training and want a program that may help you get stronger and recover faster.\n\nI think the Perform and Pump tracks are more suitable if you\u2019re an advanced lifter. These tracks will offer challenges even if you have years of experience and coaching under your belt.\n\n\u2026\n\n## FBB Persist Program Specs\n\n|Price|$39/month; $99/quarter; $325/year|\n|--|--|\n|Workout tracks|Pillars, Pump Lift, Pump Condition, Perform, Minimalist|\n|Types of training|Minimal equipment workouts, hypertrophy, conditioning, and/or Olympic lifting|\n|Extras|Weekly emails, video messages from Marcus Filly, vast library of demo videos|\n|Gym membership required|No|\n|Workout per week|4-5 depending on track|\n|Mobility sessions per week|2-3 depending on track|\n\n\u2026\n\n## Methodology Behind Persist\n\nAt the core of the Persist training program, Marcus Filly and his team use principles of progressive overload to help you achieve muscle size and strength. Persist is a well thought-out program, it\u2019s not a kitchen sink workout randomly sprinkled with burpees.\n\n\u2026\n\nProgress isn\u2019t linear, and the Persit program from FBB addresses that head on. In all five tracks of the program, you will see nearly all of the principles of progressive overload show up, including load, repetitions, volume, rest period, range of motion, tempo, frequency, and degree of difficulty.\n\nIn a welcome video from Marcus Filly, he notes that there is a fine line between \u201cGetting a great training session and feeling like you didn\u2019t work hard enough.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\n## Persist Offers Five Different Tracks To Choose From\n\nThere are five different tracks to choose from within the Persist program. All programs run on 6-week training cycles that typically build on movements and skills from the previous cycle.\n\nIn an introduction video to the program, Marcus Filly encourages athletes to stay on one track during the cycle to get the most benefit from the programming and progression. I did toggle a bit between tracks, but I mainly used Pillars.\nHere is what to expect from each training track:\n\n**Pillars Track:**Four, 60-minute workouts per week, focusing on functional fitness and compound movements like squat, bench, deadlift, and overhead press (plus conditioning finishers like EMOMS, AMRAPS, and burnout sets) **Pump Condition Track:**Five, 75-minute muscle-building and hypertrophy-style sessions with conditioning added at the end of most workouts **Pump Lift Track:**Five, 75-minute hypertrophy-style sessions without conditioning **Perform Track** **:**Five, 90 minute sessions that includes Olympic lifts and other functional fitness **Minimalist** **Track:**Five, 60-minute\n\n\u2026\n\n- You can go through the prescribed workouts at your own pace throughout the week, but I think it\u2019s worth noting that all tracks on the Persist program have you lifting four to five days per week, which might be a lot for some folks.\n\n- Most tracks include conditioning as part of the programming, something to keep in mind for anyone coming from a non-cardio background (like me!).\n\n- I personally wouldn\u2019t recommend this program for true beginners, but I do think that if you\u2019ve had some dumbbell and barbell lifting experience, you\u2019ll be just fine!",

Programming for the top 10% of your athletes and scaling for the rest doesn't work. Your members want to follow the training as closely as prescribed each day, not two members out of twenty doing ring muscle-ups and the other 18 doing something completely different. By avoiding this, your class experience is more seamless and less disjointed.\n\nWhen most class members are doing the same class workout, the vibe is better, the community is stronger, and the consistency is greater. The result is increased fitness and a better business.\n\n**We program for a consistent weekly structure **\n\nWe balance a predictable rhythm to the schedule with variance in workouts.\n\nEvery week, your members will get:\n\nThis simple structure promotes clear, consistent progress for members but also keeps training enjoyable and engaging.\n\nIt helps each member build a sustainable routine, promoting growth and forging a strong community within your gym.\n\n**We program benchmark workouts every two weeks.**\n\nEvery year we repeat 24 workouts to make progress tracking easy for your members.\n\nThis visibility, consistency, and accountability will show them on a regular basis how they are improving over time.\n\nThrough routine testing and clear metrics, you'll create a gym community where progress is not just hoped for but expected and achieved.\n\n**We program to build strength, endurance, and capacity sustainably.**\n\nRather than focusing on building strength one month, endurance in another, and high-intensity capacity in the next, we build them together every week and all year round.\n\nIt ensures our training program moves you forward across all fitness domains, creating a well-rounded athlete ready for any challenge \u2014whether on the field, in the gym, or in the real world.\n\nYour members will love feeling stronger & getting fitter, slowly and sustainably.\n\n**We program for the functional movement patterns of an active life.**\n\nYour members want the ability to play, to compete, and to live at whatever speed they desire.\n\nWe believe in programming highly functional movements applicable across sports, outdoor adventures, and daily life. Most don't need or want sport-specific skills with narrow real-world utility.\n\nWe don't program complex gymnastic movements for this reason.\n\nThe reality of your member\u2019s lives demands strength, endurance, and capacity. It doesn't require them to know how to walk on their hands.\n\n**We program for members who want to train smart**\n\nYour members want to be your members forever. They don\u2019t want to get beat up and spit out. They don't want to keep searching. They want a training program they can do consistently, and that works.\n\nIntensity drives results, but when structured poorly and without intelligent controls around volume, it can become the barrier to progress instead of the main driver..\n\nWe implement what we call \u201cintentional intensity\u201d through movement pairings, loading, & rep shemes that fall into our programming sweet spot for sustainable power output.\n\nThis allows your coaches and therefore your members to maximize their training efficiency while preventing overtraining and ensuring sustainable progress.\n\nThe result: Your members will build up, not burn out.\n\n**We program running as a cornerstone. **\n\nTraveling efficiently from one point to another is as functional as it gets. Because it's one of the most fundamental movements your members will ever do, they need repeated, consistent exposure to it.\n\nThis is why your programming will include running 2-3 times a week at varying intensities and distances. Your members\u2019 fitness will be grounded in this natural human movement.\n\n**We program with proven methods and are always adapting**\n\nJust as you are committed to improving your gym for the long-term benefit of your members, we're committed to improving our offering for the long-term benefit of our partner gyms.\n\nWe promise to adapt, refine, and elevate our programming over time. We\u2019ll avoid stagnating, embrace continual improvement, and remain willing to challenge our own beliefs if needed. As fitness science evolves, so does our programming.\n\nBy embracing a drive for evolution, we aim to be both relevant and revolutionary.\n\nWhat does a typical week of The CompTrain Gym Programming look like?

          "snippet": "Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock for the past 7 or 8 years, you\u2019re probably\n\n*pretty *familiar with Mat Fraser.\n\nYou don\u2019t even need to watch the video; the title is enough.\n\n\u201cMat Fraser is the Five-Time Fittest Man on Earth\u201d\n\n(Fraser even wrote a ~300-page book detailing his adventure; you can read my review of the Hard Work Pays Off Book here!)\n\nFraser retired from the sport after his fifth CrossFit Games and could have easily ridden off into the sunset. He certainly had a lot of endorsements and prize money to last him.\n\nInstead, he decided to grace the world with his take on CrossFit training, creating a program, HWPO (\u201cHard Work Pays Off\u201d) that can be had for $40 a month.\n\nI followed HWPO\u2019s Flagship program pretty closely for roughly 18 months and feel as though I have a pretty good grasp on what the training is all about.\n\nHere is my HWPO programming review (as well as my wife\u2019s experience with HWPO 60) and my thoughts on how it may or may not be\n\n*the* program for other CrossFitters.\n\nTLDR: It is a pretty good CrossFit training program\u2026but I\n\n*much* prefer (both the program itself and my results) Sentinel Training.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n## Program Structure\n\nThe HWPO programming structure is unique (to me at least) in the manner in which each workout is scheduled. Rather than simply dropping you in to wherever a particular program is at the current moment (Ex. Comptrain), there is a definite \u201cDay 1\u201d, \u201cDay 100\u201d, \u201cDay 400\u201d and on. You\u2019ll start with the same workouts everybody else has started with and work through the same cycles whether you jump in early January, April, or October.\n\n(that year, there was a \u201cOpen Prep\u201d option added for those looking to prep for the upcoming open, but this was programming split off from the \u201cFlagship\u201d track).\n\nI like this structure and think that it gets all participants \u201cup to speed\u201d with the program\u2019s overall structure as well as those of each workout. Even advanced athletes would likely struggle if they randomly dropped into \u201cDay 273\u201d of the program due to relatively intense nature of the workouts. The first few program weeks do an excellent job of preparing athletes for the rigors to come.\n\nFraser has programmed a number of cycles and \u201cwaves\u201d into the program, most notably those involving squats, Olympic lifts and rowing\u2026yeah\u2026rowing.\n\nYou do\n\n*a lot *of rowing the HWPO training program! Mal O\u2019Brien can confirm!\n\nThere is obviously a method to this and I can attest that my strength and rowing\n\n*endurance *levels (I still needed a bit of technique work!) have gotten better (and probably better than they *would *have gotten with other, general programming) with HWPO programming.\n\nThere are 5 \u201cnormal\u201d training days each week. One day is a full rest day while another day involves much shorter and \u201clighter\u201d activity (ex. spin bike, light swimming).\n\n## Workout Structure \u2013 HWPO Flagship vs. HWPO 60\n\nNow that I have experience with multiple HWPO training programs, I will split this section up to discuss each in detail.\n\n### HWPO Flagship\n\nWorkouts in the Flagship program take on a pretty consistent pattern. A decently intense active warm-up (with movements somewhat mimicking the exercises) starts things off followed by strength pieces. Without fail, squats and front squats are programmed twice a week and deadlifts and bench press each once a week. Olympic lifts are generally performed three days each week with the volume and variety differing depending on the cycle.\n\nThe overall volume and rep counts differ greatly here, but you can expect to perform between 10 and 22-25 working sets during this portion. All of the weights for these sets are based off of 1RM percentages.\n\nAfter the strength piece there is some kind of cardio element, whether in the form of a classic metcon, a dedicated rowing piece, or a dedicated Assault Bike/Echo Bike piece. These generally last between 12 and 20 minutes.\n\nAccessory work and \u201cBonus work\u201d close out each workout. While the bonus content is not always present, accessory work\n\n*always *is. Interestingly enough, these portions vary *greatly *in length and intensity. Some days, a few sets of GHD-machine back extensions are programmed. Other times, you might find something like\u2026this\u2026\n\nThe length of HWPO training workouts has been discussed at length before and, truth be told, the workouts can go\n\n*pretty *long. I generally keep my rest periods between 2 and 3 minutes during the strength pieces and still end up hitting my self-imposed 1:50 workout \u201ctime cap\u201d about 70 percent of the time.\n\nI know others rest less than I do during these pieces, but I don\u2019t rest very long between pieces. As such, I don\u2019t know who can reasonably expect to consistently get through these workouts in less than 1:45. If you\u2019re not particularly \u201cfast\u201d, expect to make some cuts to each workout.\n\n### HWPO 60\n\nRecently, my wife started the \u201cHWPO 60\u201d program\u2026and is\n\n*loving *it. After bouncing around between HWPO Flagship (we started at the same time, although she switched programs after about 10 months) and Street Parking (and one\u2026less-than-enjoyable day of PRVN) she decided to re-join the HWPO \u201cfamily\u201d!\n\nAlthough it has been quite a while since she started HWPO Flagship, via careful notes she kept, she is able to compare the early days of the program to the first week of HWPO. Essentially, the program content are very,\n\n*very *similar.\n\n**The main difference**? On most days of HWPO 60, either a strength piece or an accessory piece (sometimes multiple accessory pieces) is removed from the HWPO Flagship program. More rarely, the metcon or rowing piece is anywhere between 25 and 33 percent shorter and/or the percentages for strength workouts are slightly lighter.\n\nOther than that, the programs are the same. My wife has never clocked a longer than 70 minutes in an HWPO 60 workout (completing\n\n*all* pieces *and *accounting for warm-up and clean-up time) yet still feels as though she is getting a *complete* training experience.\n\n## Intensity\n\nThere are definitely intensity waves programmed into the HWPO programming, but\n\n*everything *feels pretty intense to me most of the time. Even the standard 40-minute EMOM (usually scheduled for Saturday or Sunday) generally has one or two elements that up the ante.\n\nThat being said, there is always a \u201cheavy\u201d squat day and a \u201clight\u2026ish\u201d squat day each week. During many of the high-intensity metcons, there are built-in break periods to force you to take your foot off of the gas for a bit.\n\nThese forced breaks, while giving you a brief respite from the WOD\u2019s rigors, actually work to\n\n*increase *the overall intensity. In contrast to a 20-minute AMRAP that you might \u201cget lost\u201d in the middle of, 4, 2-minute AMRAPs with 1-minute rest periods between them forces you to *really *give it your all in each work window.\n\n## Equipment Needs\n\nHWPO programming assumes you have access to a good amount of equipment to include barbells, bumpers, dumbbells, kettlebells, GHD, rower, fan bike, ski erg, spin bike, weighted vest, bench, pull-up rig, rings, rope, sandbag\u2026probably some other stuff, too, but you get the point.\n\nYou can modify a lot of the movements (and if you listen to Fraser\u2019s detailed, 10-15-minute explanations before each workout, he\u2019ll mention these modifications from time to time), but I think you\n\n*really *need most of this stuff to get the most benefit from the workouts and program.\n\nI didn\u2019t have a ski erg or a spin bike (although I did have a dinky, cheap upright bike) so would generally sub some other type of cardio machine out for these items. The ski erg hadn\u2019t become\n\n*that* popular (yet) so I didn\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve missed out too much on something vital.\n\n## Community\n\nIn addition to all of the programming and videos from Fraser discussing workouts and movements, there is a dedicated HWPO Circle community for all paid members.\n\nThis community functions kind of like a subreddit community or Facebook group with members discussing their workouts, asking questions, and soliciting form feedback. Generally, form-related videos receive almost instant feedback from other HWPO members. There are also HWPO staff coaches who closely monitor the groups who are quick to provide feedback.\n\nThe Circle group is probably\n\n*most* valuable for the garage or basement gym HWPO athletes who desire more of a community setting or for those who don\u2019t have access to eyes-on coaching. It is no substitute for immediate, in-person feedback, but it is definitely the next best thing!\n\n## \u201cWho is HWPO Flagship\n\n*Truly *Designed For?\u201d\n\n\u201cIntensity\u201d and \u201cdifficulty\u201d are not always mutually inclusive concepts, but with HWPO training, I feel as though there is a\n\n*bit *of overlap. I oftentimes felt myself wondering \u201cwho the heck is this program *truly *designed for?!\u201d I say this by thinking about my own capability in relation to those of the general CrossFit population.\n\nThe last couple of years, I have messed around with the CrossFit Open workouts. I have always gone hard when performing them, but haven\u2019t re-tested any of them and haven\u2019t altered my training to accommodate them. When the dust has cleared, I would have easily qualified for the Age-Group Quarterfinals and possibly even for the overall QFs.\n\nThat being said, I find myself scaling weights or movements during the HWPO metcons and cardio pieces between\n\n**60 and 70 percent of the time**.\n\nI am obviously not an elite athlete, but the top dogs are getting (good) individualized coaching and programming.\n\n\u2026so, again\u2026\u201dwho the heck is this program designed for?!\u201d\n\nThere is definitely a gap between my ability level and the\n\n*near *top-level athletes who HWPO Flagship is probably *perfect *for. Not much scaling of weights or exercises\u2026the *perfect *level of intensity and challenge.\n\nHowever, I feel like this gap can\u2019t be\n\n*that *big and that most people running the program are scaling as much, if not more often than I am.\n\nThis isn\u2019t even taking into account the long workout durations. If I didn\u2019t work from home, if I had kids, etc. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d fit it all in, seeing that I have to time cap myself anyways (I\u2019d probably\n\n*have* to go with HWPO 60)!\n\nIf you\u2019re willing to humble yourself and use some discretion to scale workouts and to focus your attention on areas you need the most work on, you can\n\n*definitely *benefit from the Flagship or HWPO 60 programs.\n\n## Personal Results\n\nI took the plunge into HWPO programming in February of 2022 when I first moved into my new basement gym. I had been doing some less-than-ideal and unorganized \u201cself-programming\u201d (sic) for close to a year in the old garage cube and was a bit out of shape.\n\nThe \u201con-boarding\u201d weeks were perfect for me and I quickly re-gained much of my previous conditioning while also quickly growing accustomed to the program\u2019s structure.\n\nIn a little over a year\u2019s time, I set PRs in almost all of the program\u2019s barbell movements (squat, front squat, deadlift, power snatch, snatch, strict press) with the clean and jerk being the notable exceptions (I have personal issues with these lifts that I need to get sorted with eyes-on coaching!) Additionally, my rowing and Assault Bike capabilities\n\nShortly before taking my break from HWPO, I re-tested CrossFit Open WOD 20.1\u2026the infamous 10 rounds of snatches and bar-facing burpees.

CrossFit Programming Principles\n\n### 1.1 The CrossFit Methodology: \"Constantly Varied, High-Intensity, Functional Movement\"\n\nCrossFit's core programming philosophy, as articulated by founder Greg Glassman and reiterated across CrossFit.com's mainsite and Level 1 certification materials, rests on three pillars:\n\n- **Constantly Varied**: Workouts are never predictable. Movement patterns, time domains, loading, and modalities rotate to prevent adaptation and build broad physical preparedness.\n- **High Intensity**: Intensity \u2014 defined as power output (force \u00d7 distance / time) \u2014 is the primary driver of results. CrossFit prioritizes relative intensity over volume.\n- **Functional Movement**: Multi-joint, compound movements that mirror real-world demands \u2014 squats, deadlifts, presses, pulls, carries, and locomotion.\n\n**Application to Hyrox**: Hyrox demands exactly these qualities. The race is a chipper of eight 1-km runs interspersed with eight functional stations (ski erg, sled push, sled pull, burpee broad jumps, rowing, farmer's carry, sandbag lunges, wall balls). CrossFit's own official article, *\"Why CrossFit Loves Hyrox\"* (crossfit.com, January 2026), openly calls the Hyrox race format \"one heck of a chipper\" and draws direct parallels to classic benchmark WODs like Murph, Clovis, Filthy Fifty, and Glen. The article notes that \"CrossFit athletes developed all metabolic pathways, allowing them to show repeated bouts of high-power output\u2026 sustained intensity in high-glycolytic events\u2026 while having the aerobic capacity to endure through a race that lasts approximately an hour\" (Rochet, CrossFit.com, 2026).\n\n### 1.2 Typical CrossFit Class Structure\n\nA standard CrossFit class (typically 60 minutes) follows this template:\n\n| Phase | Duration | Purpose |\n|-------|----------|---------|\n| **Warm-Up** | 10\u201315 min | General movement prep, specific skill activation, progressive loading |\n| **Strength / Skill** | 15\u201320 min | Heavy barbell work (squat, deadlift, press, Olympic lifts), gymnastic skill, or specific capacity building |\n| **WOD (Workout of the Day)** | 8\u201325 min | The conditioning piece \u2014 the heart of the session |\n| **Cool-Down / Accessory** | 5\u201310 min | Mobility, light accessory work, breathing drills |\n\nAccording to CrossFit's *Programming Basics: Part 1* (crossfit.com), coaches are taught to design workouts by first determining duration, movement functions, loading parameters, format (single modality, couplet, triplet, chipper), and priority (task vs. time). This systematic approach is something an AI coaching system should absolutely replicate.\n\n### 1.3 Common WOD Formats\n\n| Format | Description | Hyrox Relevance |\n|--------|-------------|-----------------|\n| **AMRAP** (As Many Rounds As Possible) | Time-priority: max work in a fixed window (e.g., 20 min) | Builds pacing instincts and sustained output \u2014 critical for managing energy across 8 stations |\n| **For Time** (Task Priority) | Complete prescribed work as fast as possible | Directly mirrors the Hyrox race format: finish the total work as quickly as possible |\n| **EMOM** (Every Minute On the Minute) | Perform set work at the start of each minute; rest with remaining time | Teaches interval pacing and work-rest transitions \u2014 perfect for simulating run-to-station transitions |\n| **Chipper** | Large volume of movements performed sequentially, no repeating | The Hyrox race IS a chipper. This is the single most transferable WOD format. |\n| **Tabata** | 8 rounds of 20 sec work / 10 sec rest | Useful for anaerobic capacity but less directly applicable to Hyrox's longer time domain |\n\n### 1.4 Classic CrossFit Workouts That Transfer Well to Hyrox Preparation\n\n**1. \"Murph\"** \u2014 1-mile run, 100 pull-ups, 200 push-ups, 300 air squats, 1-mile run (with 20-lb vest). The bookended runs with high-volume bodyweight work build exactly the kind of run-under-fatigue capacity Hyrox demands. The time domain (35\u201360+ min) matches Hyrox race duration.\n\n**2. \"Filthy Fifty\"** \u2014 50 reps each of 10 different exercises for time. This chipper format teaches athletes to manage effort across multiple stations, pacing through varied movement demands \u2014 the fundamental Hyrox skill.\n\n**3. \"Chad\" (1000-rep chipper)** \u2014 1,000 reps of box step-ups with a 20-lb vest. This trains sustained muscular endurance and mental fortitude through monotonous, high-volume single-movement work \u2014 directly applicable to the 100 wall balls or 100m sandbag lunges.\n\n**4. \"Glen\"** \u2014 30 clean-and-jerks, 1-mile run, 10 rope climbs, 1-mile run, 100 burpees, 1-mile run. The alternating run-and-work structure is remarkably similar to Hyrox's format.\n\n**5. A custom EMOM 40** \u2014 e.g., 10 rounds of: Min 1: Row calories, Min 2: Wall balls, Min 3: Sled push, Min 4: Rest. This teaches sustained interval work across machines and functional movements, directly simulating Hyrox race conditions.\n\n### 1.5 What CrossFit Programming Gets RIGHT for Hyrox\n\n- **Work Capacity / Engine Building**: CrossFit's emphasis on sustained high-power output across varied time domains builds the aerobic and anaerobic base that underlies Hyrox performance. The sport of CrossFit literally defines fitness as \"work capacity across broad time and modal domains.\"\n- **Metabolic Conditioning**: CrossFit athletes are pre-adapted to every metabolic pathway Hyrox tests \u2014 phosphocreatine (burpee broad jumps), glycolytic (sled push/pull, rowing), and oxidative (8 km of running).\n- **Mental Toughness**: Long chippers and Hero WODs build the psychological resilience needed to push through the final stations of a Hyrox race. CrossFit athletes are practiced at managing discomfort.\n- **Movement Familiarity**: As CrossFit.com notes, CrossFit athletes are \"no strangers to the ski erg, rower, sleds, lunges, carries, or burpee broad jumps. And we invented the wall-ball shot\" (Rochet, 2026).\n- **Mixed-Modal Training**: The concept of combining monostructural cardio with functional movements in a single session is a CrossFit hallmark and the very essence of Hyrox.\n\n### 1.6 What CrossFit Programming MISSES for Hyrox\n\n- **Running Volume**: Standard CrossFit programming includes runs of 200m\u20131600m within WODs, but rarely prescribes dedicated running sessions. CompTrain includes running 2\u20133 times per week (comptrain.com/gym-programming-principles), which is ahead of most, but even this is insufficient for the 8 km total running in Hyrox. Mat Fraser himself admitted after his first Hyrox: \"The stations I was keeping up just fine. But on the running, there were a couple times I was like, 'O'Keefe, chill'\" (BoxLife Magazine, 2025).\n- **Specific Station Work**: CrossFit rarely programs 50m sled pushes at Hyrox weights, 100m sandbag lunges, or 200m farmer's carries at prescribed loads. The volume and specificity of these movements differ significantly from CrossFit's approach.\n- **Pacing Strategy**: CrossFit often rewards all-out intensity. Hyrox demands strategic pacing across 60\u201390+ minutes. An athlete who redlines on the sled push may lose minutes on subsequent runs \u2014 a skill CrossFit doesn't explicitly train.\n- **Aerobic Base / Zone 2 Work**: CrossFit rarely prescribes dedicated low-intensity aerobic sessions. Hyrox performance is heavily dependent on aerobic capacity, which requires deliberate Zone 2 training.\n- **Periodization for a Known Event**: CrossFit's \"constantly varied\" philosophy means it rarely peaks athletes for a specific event. Hyrox athletes need periodized 8\u201316 week blocks that culminate in race-day readiness.\n\n**AI Coach Takeaway**: Steal CrossFit's chipper and EMOM formats, its scaling methodology, its emphasis on functional movement standards, and its mental toughness development. But layer in dedicated running programming, station-specific practice, and deliberate pacing education.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Hyrox Official Training Programs\n\n### 2.1 Hyrox Official Training Partnerships\n\nHyrox does not produce a single, proprietary training app in the way CrossFit.com provides mainsite programming. Instead, Hyrox operates through **Official Online Training Partners**, listed on hyrox.com/hyrox-online-training-partners/. As of 2025\u20132026, these partners include:\n\n**LEVLS** \u2014 The primary official Hyrox training partner. LEVLS offers two main programs:\n- **HYROX Race**: A structured, progressive program building toward a specific race date, incorporating all 8 station movements with benchmark workouts.\n- **HYROX Daily**: Ongoing training for year-round Hyrox fitness.\n\nLEVLS uses \"tried and tested progressive methodology\" with benchmark workouts at each station to track improvements. The programs include structured training blocks, performance tracking, and the ability to target individual station weaknesses. LEVLS is app-based and represents the closest thing to an \"official Hyrox program.\"\n\n**Endur** \u2014 Partnered with Hyrox World Champion Alexander Roncevic, offering step-by-step audio and video coaching for Open and Pro categories.\n\n**Relentless Method** \u2014 Offers personalized Hyrox training with AI adaptation, adjusting to athlete ability, equipment, and schedule. Athletes choose between fitness-focused or race-intense plans.\n\n**Centr** \u2014 Chris Hemsworth's platform became an official Hyrox partner offering certified race-specific programs integrated with nutrition, recovery, and mindset coaching. It's a holistic platform but more generalist than specialized (ChAIron.app analysis, 2025).\n\n### 2.2 Hyrox Academy & Master Trainer Ecosystem\n\nHyrox has developed a multi-level education and certification system through the **Hyrox Academy** (documented on roxlyfe.com/hyrox-365):\n- **HYROX Foundation Course** (\"Get Race Ready\") \u2014 Entry-level certification for coaches\n- **Level 1\u20134 Education Courses** \u2014 Progressive qualification covering periodization, biomechanics, nutrition, business strategy, and race development\n- These certifications create \"HYROX Performance Coaches\" who implement the Hyrox methodology in gyms worldwide\n\nThe Hyrox Academy covers all aspects of athlete and performance development and is \"written by industry and science-backed experts, all delivered through an innovative LMS system\" (Roxlyfe, 2024). This ecosystem is important for AI coaches to understand because it establishes standardized coaching principles for the sport.\n\n### 2.3 HAOS Training (Hunter McIntyre's Platform)\n\nHAOS (Hunter's Academy of Strength) is built by multiple-time OCR World Champion Hunter McIntyre, who holds the Hyrox world record and MURPH world record. Key details (hyroxtrainingplans.com):\n\n- **Price**: $39.99/month\n- **Structure**: 6 days/week, ~100 min/session, 10 hours/week total commitment\n- **Four Progressive Programs**: Intro Athlete \u2192 Strength \u2192 Run \u2192 Pro\n- **Cycle Length**: 8\u201312 weeks per program phase\n- **Philosophy**: A \"proven yearly periodization model that maximizes agility, allowing you to build strength and endurance so you can quickly reach peak performance for any event\" (pro.haostraining.com)\n- **Key Differentiator**: HAOS trains for multiple racing disciplines (Spartan, Hyrox, CrossFit, Trail Running) and emphasizes the ability to pivot between sports \u2014 a generalist-specialist hybrid approach\n\nHAOS also offers 1-on-1 coaching through Hunter McIntyre and Parker Gregory for athletes wanting individualized programming.\n\n**AI Coach Takeaway**: HAOS's four-level progressive structure is an excellent template for an AI system \u2014 athletes self-select their level and advance systematically. The yearly periodization model that accommodates multiple race types is particularly valuable for athletes who compete in Hyrox seasonally.\n\n### 2.4 Roxlyfe\n\nRoxlyfe offers a popular **12-Week Hyrox Training Plan** (roxlyfe.com/12-week-training-plan/) with extensive user testimonials. Key features:\n- **Multi-level scaling**: Workouts include difficulty levels so athletes can progress within the plan\n- **Weekly Hyrox simulation**: One dedicated session per week mimics race conditions \u2014 a major confidence builder\n- **Comprehensive coverage**: Runs of varying speeds/lengths, interval training, strength work, and Hyrox-specific simulations\n- **Accessible price point**: Designed for non-professional athletes\n- **Results**: Users report improvements of 3:30\u20135:30+ on race times, with personal bests across multiple stations\n\nOne testimonial captures the plan's appeal: \"The Rox Lyfe program was everything I was looking for in a hybrid training program \u2014 thoughtful, comprehensive, challenging, and accessible to non-professional athletes\" (Roxlyfe testimonials, 2025).\n\n### 2.5 Other Notable Hyrox-Specific Programs\n\n- **RMR Training** (rmr.training): Offers a 12-week flagship Hyrox program with native leaderboards, long-form video guidance, and community features. Host Rich Ryan's podcast covers structured programming for Hyrox including progressive overload, aerobic work, strength, and rest management.\n- **ChAIron**: AI-powered training app claiming 30\u201340% improved race-day pacing accuracy through real-time form feedback and adaptive difficulty (ChAIron, 2025). Represents the frontier of AI coaching for Hyrox.\n- **PRVN HYROX**: Tia-Clair Toomey and Shane Orr's PRVN has launched a dedicated Hyrox track with daily programming, 8-week cycles, race-day prep programs, and scaling options for all levels. Coached by James Kelly. Priced at $45/month.\n- **HWPO HYROX**: Mat Fraser's HWPO offers a Hyrox prep track (5x/week standalone or 2x/week layered with other training), included with HWPO All Access membership. Sessions average ~60 minutes.\n\n**AI Coach Takeaway**: The most successful Hyrox programs share these DNA traits: (1) structured periodization in 8\u201312 week blocks, (2) weekly race simulation sessions, (3) scalable difficulty levels, (4) integration of running and station work, and (5) progressive benchmarking. An AI coach should embed all five.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Running Programs for Hybrid Athletes\n\n### 3.1 The 80/20 Running Principle (Matt Fitzgerald)\n\nMatt Fitzgerald's *80/20 Running* (2014) synthesizes decades of exercise science into one actionable framework: **80% of training volume should be at low intensity (Zone 1\u20132), and only 20% at moderate-to-high intensity (Zone 3\u20135)**. This \"polarized training\" model, pioneered by exercise physiologist Dr. Stephen Seiler, is supported by robust evidence:\n\n- **Seiler & Kjerland (2006)**: World and Olympic Champion endurance athletes spend approximately 75\u201380% of training time at low intensity, despite racing at much higher intensities.\n- **Helgerud et al. (2007)**: 4\u00d74-minute intervals at 90\u201395% max HR produced **10.8% VO\u2082 max improvement** vs. only 3.5% for long slow distance \u2014 nearly 3\u00d7 the improvement.\n- **St\u00f6ggl & Sperlich (2014)**: After 9 weeks, the polarized group showed superior improvements in 10k time trial, VO\u2082 max, running economy, AND lactate threshold vs. threshold-only training. The threshold group actually declined in some metrics.\n\nSource: HyroxDataLab.com, *\"How to Structure Your HYROX Running Training\"* (2025), which provides an excellent evidence-based summary with full citations.\n\n### 3.2 Applying 80/20 to a Hyrox Athlete at 35\u201340 MPW\n\nA Hyrox athlete running 35\u201340 miles per week (a serious but achievable volume for competitive racers) would distribute approximately:\n\n- **28\u201332 miles in Zone 2** (easy, conversational pace \u2014 60\u201370% max HR)\n- **7\u20138 miles in Zone 4\u20135** (tempo and interval work \u2014 75\u201395% max HR)\n\nThis volume is higher than most Hyrox programs prescribe (most recommend 3\u20134 runs/week totaling 15\u201325 miles). Athletes at this mileage are likely targeting sub-60 or sub-55 minute Hyrox times where running split optimization becomes the primary performance lever.\n\n### 3.3 Sample Week Structure for a Hybrid Athlete (35\u201340 MPW)\n\n| Day | Running Session | Hyrox / Strength | Total Running |\n|-----|----------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| **Monday** | Easy Run, 6 mi (Zone 2) | \u2014 | 6 mi |\n| **Tuesday** | Easy Run, 5 mi (Zone 2) | PM: Hyrox Station Work (sled, row, wall balls) | 5 mi |\n| **Wednesday** | Tempo Run, 7 mi (2 mi warm-up, 3 mi tempo @ 75\u201385% HR, 2 mi cooldown) | \u2014 | 7 mi |\n| **Thursday** | Recovery Run, 4 mi (Zone 1) | PM: Strength (squat, deadlift, press) | 4 mi |\n| **Friday** | Intervals, 6 mi total (2 mi warm-up, 5\u00d74 min @ 90\u201395% HR w/3 min jog, 2 mi cooldown) | \u2014 | 6 mi |\n| **Saturday** | Easy Run, 5 mi (Zone 2) | Hyrox Race Simulation (compromised running + stations) | 5 mi |\n| **Sunday** | Long Run, 8\u201310 mi (Zone 2) | \u2014 | 8\u201310 mi |\n| **Weekly Total** | | | **~39\u201343 mi** |\n\n**Key principles**: Easy days are truly easy. Hard days (Wednesday tempo, Friday intervals) are genuinely hard. Station work is placed on separate days or in PM sessions to allow morning running quality. The long run builds aerobic infrastructure. The Saturday simulation teaches compromised running (running immediately after heavy station work).\n\n### 3.4 Polarized Training Model for Hybrid Athletes\n\nThe challenge for hybrid athletes doing both running and Hyrox station work is that **station work IS high-intensity training**. A heavy sled push session or a 100-rep wall ball set imposes significant physiological stress. This means:\n\n- Station work days should be counted in the \"20% hard\" bucket\n- Easy running days must be deliberately slow to compensate\n- Total training stress (running + lifting + stations) must be managed holistically\n- An athlete doing 3 hard station sessions plus 2 hard runs is at 5 high-intensity sessions/week \u2014 almost certainly too much\n\nThe practical recommendation from Hyrox Data Lab (2025) is: **3 running sessions + 2 Hyrox strength sessions per week**, with one of the three runs being Zone 2, one tempo, and one intervals. This represents a polarized approach where the 80% easy work comes from Zone 2 running and recovery days, while the 20% hard comes from tempo runs, intervals, AND station work combined.\n\n### 3.5 Key Running Workouts Every Hyrox Athlete Should Do\n\n**1. Zone 2 Long Run (60\u201390 minutes)**\n- The aerobic engine builder. Increases mitochondrial density, improves fat oxidation (preserving glycogen for stations), and builds capillary networks.\n- Progression: Add 5\u201310 min every 2\u20133 weeks until reaching 90 min. Don't exceed 90 min \u2014 this isn't marathon training.\n- Practice race nutrition during long runs.\n\n**2. Tempo Run (20\u201340 minutes at 75\u201385% max HR)**\n- Raises lactate threshold and teaches the body to sustain \"comfortably hard\" effort. This pace approximates the average Hyrox running pace between stations.\n- Should feel hard but sustainable \u2014 \"short sentences only\" on the talk test.\n\n**3. VO\u2082 Max Intervals (4\u20138 \u00d7 3\u20134 min at 90\u201395% max HR)**\n- The research-backed \"magic protocol\": 4\u00d74 minutes at 90\u201395% max HR with 3-min active recovery (Helgerud et al., 2007).\n- Maximizes VO\u2082 max \u2014 the ceiling that determines performance under extreme fatigue in late-race stations.\n\n**4. Easy Runs (30\u201350 minutes, Zone 1\u20132)**\n- Recovery runs that accumulate volume without adding stress. These are the \"80%\" that makes the \"20%\" possible.\n- Common mistake: running these too hard. If you can't hold a full conversation, slow down.\n\n**5. Compromised Running (Hyrox-specific)**\n- Running immediately after station work (e.g., 50m sled push \u2192 immediate 1 km run).\n- Teaches pacing under peripheral and central fatigue \u2014 the unique skill Hyrox demands that no pure running program addresses.\n- Fraser structures this as: \"800m run \u2192 row \u2192 800m run \u2192 rest \u2192 800m run \u2192 ski erg \u2192 800m run\" (BoxLife Magazine, 2025).\n\n**AI Coach Takeaway**: Steal the 80/20 distribution as the governing principle for total training load. Implement Zone 2 running as non-negotiable daily programming for aerobic base. Use the 4\u00d74 interval protocol for VO\u2082 max development. Most importantly, introduce \"compromised running\" as a Hyrox-specific training modality that pure running programs miss entirely.\n\n---\n\n## 4. COMPARISON MATRIX: All Programs Analyzed\n\nThis is the critical synthesis deliverable. The matrix below evaluates each program across standardized dimensions relevant to Hyrox race preparation.\n\n### 4.1 Full Comparison Table\n\n| Program | Focus Area | Sessions/Week | Conditioning Style | Strength Method | Running Component | Hyrox Readiness (1\u201310) | Best For |\n|---------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------|\n| **PRVN (CrossFit Track)** | General physical preparedness via CrossFit methodology; strength + conditioning | 5\u20136 | Mixed-modal metcons, AMRAPs, EMOMs, chippers; broad time domains (5\u201335 min) | Systematic barbell cycles (squat, deadlift, press, Olympic lifts); progressive overload across 8-week cycles | Limited within WODs (200\u2013800m runs); not programmed as dedicated sessions | **5/10** \u2014 Elite GPP base and movement familiarity, but lacks dedicated running volume, station-specific work, and Hyrox pacing practice | CrossFit competitors wanting broad fitness; athletes using it as a GPP base who will add Hyrox-specific layers |\n| **PRVN (Hyrox Track)** | Hyrox-specific: sled power, carry strength, run durability, station efficiency | 5\u20137 (daily programming) | Race-focused: run intervals, sled work, rowing, ski erg, wall balls; 8-week structured cycles | Integrated functional strength for carry/sled/lunge capacity; less pure barbell focus than CrossFit track | Run intervals and tempo sessions built into programming; more running than CrossFit track | **8/10** \u2014 Purpose-built by Toomey/Orr/Kelly; structured cycles, scaling options, race-day prep. Missing only ultra-high running volume for sub-55 athletes | Dedicated Hyrox competitors at all levels; CrossFit athletes transitioning to Hyrox |\n| **HWPO Flagship** | Elite CrossFit performance; strength, Oly lifting, rowing, conditioning | 5 + 1 active recovery + 1 rest | Metcons (12\u201320 min), EMOM work, dedicated rowing/bike erg pieces; interval-based with forced breaks | Heavy: squat 2\u00d7/wk, deadlift 1\u00d7/wk, bench 1\u00d7/wk, Oly lifts 3\u00d7/wk; percentage-based progressive cycles | Minimal \u2014 running appears within WODs but no structured running program | **4/10** \u2014 Builds massive work capacity, rowing endurance, and mental toughness. But sessions are 1:45\u20132:00 hrs, running is neglected, and Hyrox-specific stations aren't trained. Overkill on Oly lifting. | CrossFit competitors and advanced fitness enthusiasts wanting Fraser-level programming intensity |\n| **HWPO Hyrox** | Hyrox race preparation layered onto HWPO base | 5\u00d7/wk standalone OR 2\u00d7/wk add-on | Hyrox-specific conditioning: race simulation, station work, compromised cardio | Functional strength oriented toward Hyrox station demands | Integrated \u2014 running is central to the programming; Fraser explicitly prioritizes running (\"Priority one\") | **7/10** \u2014 Leverages Fraser's elite programming mind for Hyrox specifics. Available as add-on (flexible). But newer program; less track record than established Hyrox platforms. ~60 min sessions are efficient. | HWPO members wanting Hyrox prep; CrossFit athletes with limited time for a second program |\n| **CompTrain** | Sustainable general fitness; accessible CrossFit programming for gym classes | 6 (Mon\u2013Sat) | Balanced: 8\u201318 min conditioning + strength days, 20\u201335 min longer conditioning days, team workouts Saturday | Weekly: press, pull (deadlift), squat; biannual benchmark testing (24 WODs/year) | **Running 2\u20133\u00d7/week** at varying intensities/distances \u2014 a standout among CrossFit programs | **5/10** \u2014 Best pure CrossFit program for running integration. Sustainable intensity model. But no Hyrox-specific station work, race simulation, or periodization toward a Hyrox event. | Gym owners/members wanting quality group programming; athletes who want running-inclusive CrossFit |\n| **Persist (Marcus Filly)** | Functional bodybuilding: hypertrophy + mobility + controlled conditioning | 4\u20135 | Conditioning finishers (EMOMs, AMRAPs, burnout sets); not the primary focus. Perform track = 90-min sessions with more conditioning | Progressive overload across squat, bench, deadlift, press; tempo work, controlled eccentrics, range-of-motion emphasis; 6-week cycles | Essentially none \u2014 running is not programmed | **2/10** \u2014 Excellent for building muscular endurance, mobility, and structural balance. But almost zero conditioning transfer, no running, no Hyrox-specific work. Useful only as a supplementary hypertrophy program. | Athletes needing to build muscle mass, improve movement quality, or recover from injury while maintaining training |\n| **Nick Bare Hybrid Athlete** | Running + lifting for \"optimal health, performance, and longevity\" | 7 (5 lifting + 5 running + 2 mobility; most days = two-a-days) | Minimal structured conditioning; the \"conditioning\" comes from high running volume + lifting density | Hypertrophy-focused: push/pull/lower body split; bodybuilding exercise selection (not functional movements) | **Extensive**: 5 runs/week including easy runs, intervals, threshold runs, and weekly long run; ~5 mi/day minimum | **5/10** \u2014 Outstanding running volume and endurance base. But strength programming is bodybuilding, not functional (no sleds, carries, wall balls). No race simulation. Requires extreme time commitment (two-a-days). | Endurance-curious lifters who want to run marathons/halfs while maintaining muscle; NOT optimized for Hyrox-specific demands |\n| **CrossFit Mainsite** | Broad GPP; \"unknown and unknowable\" preparedness | 5\u20136 | Maximum variance: every WOD format (AMRAP, For Time, EMOM, chipper, Tabata); time domains from 3\u201340+ min | Embedded in WODs \u2014 heavy days for squat, deadlift, press, clean, snatch; no structured linear progression | Occasional 400m\u20131600m runs within WODs; no dedicated running program | **4/10** \u2014 Builds incredible general fitness and movement competency across all Hyrox stations. But zero running specificity, no periodization, no Hyrox race simulation. Great starting point; insufficient for serious competitors. | General fitness enthusiasts; athletes wanting to \"show up and see what happens\" at their first Hyrox |\n| **80/20 Running (Fitzgerald)** | Endurance running performance via polarized intensity distribution | 3\u20136 running sessions | Polarized: 80% Zone 2, ~5% tempo, ~15% VO\u2082 max intervals; no functional conditioning | None \u2014 purely a running methodology | **Comprehensive**: long runs, tempo runs, VO\u2082 max intervals, easy runs; scalable from 20\u201360+ MPW | **3/10** \u2014 Provides the optimal running methodology for Hyrox but offers zero strength, conditioning, or station work. An AI coach should use 80/20 as the RUNNING ENGINE within a broader Hyrox program, not as a standalone solution. | Pure runners adding Hyrox to their race calendar; providing the running philosophy layer for any Hyrox program |\n| **HAOS (Hunter McIntyre)** | Multi-sport hybrid racing (Hyrox, OCR, CrossFit, trail) | 5\u20136 | Race-specific: strength + running combined; progressive from intro to pro-level; yearly periodization | Functional strength built into program progression; carries, sleds, bodyweight; builds from foundation to sport-specific | Running is a core pillar (dedicated \"Run\" program phase); speed, endurance, and running efficiency | **7/10** \u2014 Created by one of the sport's greatest competitors; proven periodization model. Four-level system is elegant. But generalist approach (covers OCR, CrossFit, trail) means Hyrox isn't the sole focus. $40/mo for non-individualized programming. | Multi-sport athletes who race Hyrox alongside OCR or other events; athletes wanting a structured yearly plan |\n| **Roxlyfe 12-Week Plan** | Hyrox race preparation for amateur/intermediate athletes | 5\u20136 | Hyrox-specific: runs, intervals, strength, weekly race simulations; scalable difficulty levels | Functional strength for station demands; progressive over 12 weeks | Progressive running: varying speeds/lengths, interval work, tempo sessions | **7/10** \u2014 Exceptional user testimonials (3:30\u20135:30 improvements). Affordable, well-structured, and specifically designed for Hyrox. Scaling options for all levels. But static program (no AI adaptation) and limited post-race ongoing programming. | First-time or intermediate Hyrox athletes wanting a proven, affordable 12-week prep plan |\n| **LEVLS (Official Hyrox Partner)** | Hyrox race preparation and daily hybrid fitness | 5\u20136 | Progressive methodology with benchmark workouts at all 8 stations; structured training blocks | Functional strength targeting station-specific demands | Integrated running as part of Hyrox race preparation | **8/10** \u2014 Official Hyrox partnership provides credibility and direct alignment with race standards. Progressive benchmarking at each station is powerful for tracking. Pre-set routines lack real-time adaptation. | Athletes wanting the \"official\" Hyrox training experience; those who value structured, methodology-driven programming |\n\n### 4.2 Hyrox Readiness Score Justifications\n\n| Program | Score | Justification |\n|---------|-------|---------------|\n| **PRVN CrossFit** | 5/10 | Builds elite general fitness and all movement competencies, but lacks Hyrox-specific running volume, station practice, and race pacing strategy. CrossFit athletes do well at Hyrox \"off the couch\" (top third), but can't compete for podiums without supplementation. |\n| **PRVN Hyrox** | 8/10 | Purpose-built by the world's most decorated CrossFit athlete (Toomey) and a top Hyrox specialist (Kelly); offers structured cycles, daily programming, race-day prep, and multi-level scaling. Only misses the ultra-high running volume needed for elite sub-55 times. |\n| **HWPO Flagship** | 4/10 | Massive work capacity builder with elite-level barbell strength and rowing endurance, but sessions are too long (1:45\u20132 hrs), running is almost absent, and Olympic lifting emphasis is misallocated for Hyrox demands. |\n| **HWPO Hyrox** | 7/10 | Fraser's programming expertise applied to Hyrox with running as declared priority. Flexible (2x or 5x/week). But relatively new program with less proven track record than dedicated Hyrox platforms; relies on Fraser's CrossFit background more than Hyrox-specific race experience. |\n| **CompTrain** | 5/10 | Uniquely among CrossFit programs, emphasizes running 2\u20133\u00d7/week and sustainable intensity (\"build up, not burn out\"). But designed for gym classes, not individual Hyrox prep; no station-specific work or race simulation. |\n| **Persist** | 2/10 | Exceptional for structural balance, hypertrophy, and mobility, but essentially zero transfer to Hyrox conditioning demands. No running, no sleds, no race simulation. Only useful as a supplementary off-season hypertrophy block. |\n| **Nick Bare Hybrid** | 5/10 | Outstanding running volume (5 runs/wk, ~25\u201335 mi) that would build an excellent aerobic base for Hyrox. But the strength side is bodybuilding (not functional), there's no station work, and the two-a-day structure is unsustainable for most. |\n| **CrossFit Mainsite** | 4/10 | Maximum variance builds readiness for anything, including Hyrox \u2014 but the lack of specificity means it's a great foundation that must be supplemented. No running program, no periodization, no race-day strategy. |\n| **80/20 Running** | 3/10 | Provides the scientifically optimal running methodology, but running alone is only ~50% of Hyrox. Zero strength, zero station work, zero race simulation. Essential as a COMPONENT of a Hyrox program, not a standalone solution. |\n| **HAOS** | 7/10 | World-record-holder's proven system with elegant 4-level progression and yearly periodization. Covers strength, running, and race prep. Loses a point for being multi-sport (not Hyrox-exclusive) and for being non-adaptive (same programming for all users). |\n| **Roxlyfe** | 7/10 | Proven 12-week plan with exceptional user results and accessible scaling. Weekly race simulations are a standout feature. Loses points for being a static plan with no ongoing programming post-race and no AI adaptation. |\n| **LEVLS** | 8/10 | Official Hyrox partnership ensures alignment with race standards and station benchmarks. Progressive methodology with structured blocks. Pre-set routines lack adaptive personalization, but the Hyrox-specific benchmarking system is best-in-class. |\n\n### 4.3 Radar Chart Summary: Program Strengths by Domain\n\n| Program | Running (1\u20135) | Strength (1\u20135) | Station Specificity (1\u20135) | Race Simulation (1\u20135) | Scalability (1\u20135) | Periodization (1\u20135) |\n|---------|--------------|----------------|--------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| PRVN CrossFit | 2 | 5 | 2 | 1 | 4 | 4 |\n| PRVN Hyrox | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 |\n| HWPO Flagship | 1 | 5 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 4 |\n| HWPO Hyrox | 4 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 |\n| CompTrain | 3 | 4 | 1 | 1 | 5 | 3 |\n| Persist | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 4 |\n| Nick Bare Hybrid | 5 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 3 |\n| CrossFit Mainsite | 1 | 4 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 1 |\n| 80/20 Running | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 4 |\n| HAOS | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 5 |\n| Roxlyfe | 4 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 |\n| LEVLS | 4 | 3 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 5 |\n\n---\n\n## 5. What an AI Coaching System Should Steal from Each Program\n\n### From CrossFit Programming (Mainsite / CompTrain)\n- **Steal**: The WOD format library (AMRAP, EMOM, For Time, Chipper) as templates for Hyrox conditioning sessions\n- **Steal**: CompTrain's principle of \"intentional intensity\" \u2014 programming movement pairings, loading, and rep schemes that fall into a \"sweet spot for sustainable power output\"\n- **Steal**: The scaling methodology \u2014 offering Rx'd, scaled, and beginner versions of every workout so the AI can serve athletes at any level\n- **Steal**: CompTrain's 24 benchmark workouts/year framework \u2014 create Hyrox-specific benchmarks (e.g., \"1km row + 1km run for time\") that repeat bimonthly for progress tracking\n\n### From PRVN\n- **Steal**: The 8-week cycle structure with built-in periodization \u2014 this is the optimal block length for Hyrox preparation\n- **Steal**: The concept of having both a \"base\" (CrossFit/GPP) track and a \"Hyrox-specific\" track that athletes can switch between depending on proximity to race day\n- **Steal**: Multi-level scaling (Level 1 through Level 3+) so the AI can auto-assign difficulty based on assessment data\n\n### From HWPO\n- **Steal**: Fraser's percentage-based strength programming \u2014 every working set prescribed as % of 1RM removes guesswork\n- **Steal**: The \"forced break\" interval format \u2014 4\u00d72-min AMRAPs with 1-min rest \u2014 which increases actual intensity vs. long unbroken AMRAPs\n- **Steal**: The sequential day numbering system (Day 1, Day 100, Day 400) which ensures progressive onboarding regardless of when an athlete starts\n\n### From HAOS (Hunter McIntyre)\n- **Steal**: The four-level progressive system (Intro \u2192 Strength \u2192 Run \u2192 Pro) as a user journey template\n- **Steal**: The yearly periodization model that peaks athletes for specific races while maintaining year-round readiness\n- **Steal**: The dual focus on strength AND running as co-equal pillars, not running bolted onto a strength program\n\n### From 80/20 Running (Fitzgerald)\n- **Steal**: The 80/20 intensity distribution as the GOVERNING PRINCIPLE for total training load (including station work in the \"hard\" bucket)\n- **Steal**: The three-run-per-week framework: Zone 2 long run, tempo run, VO\u2082 max intervals \u2014 as the minimum effective running dose\n- **Steal**: Heart rate zone training as the primary pacing metric, with clear zone definitions and talk-test fallbacks\n\n### From Nick Bare Hybrid Athlete\n- **Steal**: The two-a-day structure option (AM running / PM lifting) for athletes with time availability \u2014 the AI should offer this as an advanced mode\n- **Steal**: The concept of running EVERY training day (even if just 3\u20135 easy miles) to accumulate aerobic volume without adding separate sessions\n- **Steal**: Dedicated mobility days as programmed, non-negotiable sessions \u2014 not afterthoughts\n\n### From Persist (Marcus Filly)\n- **Steal**: Tempo-controlled lifting (e.g., 3-second eccentric squats) for building muscular endurance and joint resilience \u2014 directly applicable to sandbag lunges and farmer's carry\n- **Steal**: The \"warm-up as training\" philosophy where warm-ups include loaded movements that build toward the day's work\n- **Steal**: 6-week cycle length for hypertrophy/structural balance blocks in the off-season\n\n### From Hyrox-Specific Programs (LEVLS, Roxlyfe, RMR)\n- **Steal**: Weekly race simulation sessions \u2014 the single most Hyrox-specific training modality that no CrossFit or running program offers\n- **Steal**: Station-specific benchmarking (e.g., time your 50m sled push, 1000m row, 100 wall balls independently) to identify and target weaknesses\n- **Steal**: The \"compromised running\" concept \u2014 deliberately running immediately after heavy station work to train the specific skill of pacing under fatigue\n- **Steal**: Progressive running integration where running volume and intensity increase as race day approaches while pure strength volume decreases (CrossFit.com's 12-week Hyrox prep model: full CrossFit \u2192 reduced CF + increased specificity \u2192 taper)\n\n---\n\n## 6. Synthesis: The Ideal AI Coaching Architecture\n\nBased on this analysis, the optimal AI coaching system for Hyrox preparation should integrate:\n\n1. **Running Engine**: 80/20 polarized model with 3\u20135 runs/week, auto-adjusting volume based on race proximity and athlete level (inspired by Fitzgerald, Hyrox Data Lab)\n2. **Strength Foundation**: Percentage-based functional strength programming in 6\u20138 week cycles (inspired by HWPO, PRVN, Persist)\n3. **Station-Specific Training**: Weekly rotation through all 8 Hyrox stations with benchmark tracking (inspired by LEVLS, Roxlyfe)\n4. **Race Simulation**: Weekly chipper-style sessions mimicking full or partial Hyrox race conditions (inspired by Roxlyfe, PRVN Hyrox, CrossFit chipper WODs)\n5. **Conditioning Variety**: CrossFit WOD formats (EMOM, AMRAP, For Time) used as templates for metabolic conditioning sessions (inspired by CompTrain, CrossFit Mainsite)\n6. **Progressive System**: Multi-level athlete pathway from beginner to elite with auto-scaling (inspired by HAOS's 4-level system, PRVN's 3-level Compete)\n7. **Periodization**: Year-round programming with 8\u201312 week race-prep blocks that peak for specific events (inspired by HAOS yearly model, PRVN cycles)\n8. **Pacing Intelligence**: Zone-based training with HR monitoring, enforced easy days, and race-pace calibration (inspired by 80/20, Hyrox Data Lab's anti-gray-zone philosophy)\n\nNo single existing program scores a 10/10. The programs that come closest \u2014 PRVN Hyrox (8/10) and LEVLS (8/10) \u2014 still lack adaptive personalization and ultra-high running volume options. The opportunity for an AI coaching system is to synthesize the best elements from all programs into a truly personalized, adaptive Hyrox preparation experience.\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- CrossFit.com, *\"Why CrossFit Loves Hyrox\"* by Stephane Rochet (January 2026)\n- CrossFit.com, *\"Programming Basics: Part 1\"* (November 2025)\n- CompTrain.com, *\"Simplify With Structure: Gym Programming Principles\"* (2025)\n- HyroxDataLab.com, *\"How to Structure Your HYROX Running Training\"* (December 2025)\n- Hyrox.com, *\"HYROX Online Training Partners\"* (2025)\n- PRVN Fitness, *\"PRVN Hyrox Program\"* (prvnfitness.com, 2025)\n- HWPO Training, *\"HWPO HYROX\"* (hwpotraining.com, 2026)\n- BoxLife Magazine, *\"Matt Fraser Barely Trained for His First HYROX\u2026 Now He's Going All In for Chicago\"* (April 2025)\n- Garage Gym Revisited, *\"HWPO Programming Review\"* (October 2025)\n- Garage Gym Reviews, *\"Functional Bodybuilding Persist Review\"* (February 2025)\n- HyroxTrainingPlans.com, *\"HAOS Training App \u2014 Hunter McIntyre\"* (2024)\n- Pro.HAOSTraining.com (2026)\n- Roxlyfe.com, *\"12 Week Training Plan\"* and *\"HYROX365\"* (2025)\n- ChAIron.app, *\"The 5 Best Apps for HYROX Athletes in 2025\"* (December 2025)\n- Playbook App, *\"Hybrid Athlete 1.0 by Nick Bare\"* (2021)\n- NickBare.com, *\"Training for Hybrid Athletes\"* (2023)\n- Matt Fitzgerald, *80/20 Running: Run Stronger and Race Faster by Training Slower* (2014, NAL/Penguin)\n- Seiler, S. & Kjerland, G.\u00d8.
