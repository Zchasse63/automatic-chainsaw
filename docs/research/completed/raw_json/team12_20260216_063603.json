          "snippet": "The ERGs are small pieces of the overall time, but they have an outsized impact on your\n\n**heart rate, fatigue, and ability to actually run well between stations**. And if your damper settings or stroke rates are even a little off? Yeah\u2026 they\u2019ll let you know.\n\nIn our latest episode of the\n\n\u2026\n\n## The SkiErg: Stroke Rate, Damper, and the \u201cGreen Zone\u201d You Keep Missing\n\nLet\u2019s start with the big one:\n\n**slow, heavy, powerful strokes do NOT automatically mean \u201cmore efficient.\u201d**\n\nYou've seen the videos:\n\n30 strokes per minute vs 60 strokes per minute \u2014 same pace.\nThe internet loves to say low SPM is better.\n\nJames says\u2026\n\n*not really.* **The Truth About Stroke Rate** **30 SPM**\u2192 too heavy, too long, too much muscular fatigue **60 SPM**\u2192 too frantic, too cardiovascularly expensive **40\u201348 SPM**\u2192 the sweet spot for most HYROX athletes\n\n\u2026\n\nYou need to\n\n**get through the resistance quickly and rhythmically.** **Fix Your Technique in 10 Seconds**\n\nStop squatting. Start hinging.\n\nThat\u2019s it.\n\nThe moment you turn the SkiErg into a squat workout, you\u2019re donating your running legs to the pain gods. The SkiErg should feel like a controlled, athletic hinge \u2014 load, hit, release. No grinding. No dragging the handles into your ankles.\n\nFind your green zone and stay there.\n\n\u2026\n\n**Stroke Rate Reality Check**\n\nMost HYROX athletes row too low.\n\n**26\u201330 SPM**is the money range for most people\n\nLower stroke rates = heavier pulls = more leg fatigue\n\nA slightly higher rate = lighter strokes = easier to sustain\n\nMeg even rows ~31 SPM when she\u2019s in rhythm \u2014 and she\u2019s one of the best in the world.\n**Damper / Drag Factor**\n\nStandard elite rowing drag factor sits around:\n\n**Men:**~130 **Women:**~120\n\nFor HYROX? You probably don\u2019t need to go any higher.\n\nEven James \u2014 with multiple world records \u2014 only goes slightly up for max-power tests.\n\nIn a race environment, lighter drag keeps your strokes snappy and repeatable.\n\n## Pacing the ERGs: The Science is Simple\n\nJames breaks it down beautifully:\n\nHYROX SkiErg pace should land around\n\n**your 5K run effort**, not a death sprint\n\nRowErg pace should typically be\n\n**2K pace + 10 seconds per 500m**\n\nBoth machines should feel\n\n*strong but controlled*\u2014 not like you're hunting PRs\n\nIf your HR spikes early, you're cooked for the next mile.\n\nDial it down. Stay in control. You're racing 8K, not 800m.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Efficiency Wins Races\n\nIf you want to stop blowing up in HYROX, start here:\n\nSki lighter and smoother\n\nRow faster and easier\n\nKeep your HR under control\n\nBuild your engine with deliberate ERG training\n\nStop guessing your damper and stroke rate\n\nTreat the machines as rhythm stations, not hero attempts\n\nDo this consistently and your whole race changes.",

          "snippet": "### Fix #1: Stop Pushing from Too High\n\n**\u274c MISTAKE:** Upright torso, arms extended high, pushing down into the sled instead of forward.\n\n**\u2705 FIX:** Hips below shoulders, 45-degree body angle, weight driving forward not down.\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf WHY IT WORKS:** Lower position creates horizontal force vector. When you stand too tall, gravity works against you\u2014you're pushing down into the carpet, creating more friction. A 45-degree lean channels your power horizontally, moving the sled forward with less resistance.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Fix #2: Bent Arms, Not Straight Arms\n\n**\u274c MISTAKE:** Locked-out arms, pushing from shoulders, treating the sled like a bench press.\n\n**\u2705 FIX:** Elbows bent 90-120 degrees. Arms act as connectors, not pushers. Your legs do the work.\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf WHY IT WORKS:** Your legs generate 4x more power than your shoulders. Straight arms force your delts and triceps to engage heavily\u2014they fatigue fast. Bent arms simply transmit leg power to the sled. You're a conduit, not the engine.\n**\ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f DRILL: Phantom Push**\n\nPush the sled with your hands at your sides (no contact with sled). You'll immediately feel your legs taking over. Now add your arms back\u2014keep that same leg-dominant feeling. Your arms should feel almost passive.\n\nResearch on sled push biomechanics and force production shows straight arms increase shoulder fatigue by 15-20% compared to bent arms\u2014and shoulders are your limiting factor, not your legs.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Fix #7: Head Position\u2014Look Down, Not Up\n\n**\u274c MISTAKE:** Head up, watching the crowd, clock, or finish line.\n\n**\u2705 FIX:** Neutral spine, gaze 6 feet ahead on the ground.\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf WHY IT WORKS:** Head position dictates spinal alignment. Head up = extended neck = compromised power transfer through your core. Neutral spine creates a strong, stable column for force transmission. It's the same principle as deadlifts or squats\u2014neutral spine is king.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Fix #8: Grip Width\u2014Too Narrow Kills Power\n\n**\u274c MISTAKE:** Hands close together, narrow grip, unstable base.\n\n**\u2705 FIX:** Hands at shoulder width or slightly wider.\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf WHY IT WORKS:** Wider grip = better force distribution, more stability. Narrow grip puts excessive load on your center, making you work harder to stabilize the sled. It's biomechanically inefficient.\n**\ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f TEST: Try Both**\n\nNext training session, push 15m with narrow grip (hands 8 inches apart), then 15m with shoulder-width. You'll immediately feel more power and control with the wider grip. Your body will tell you the answer.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Fix #10: Wrong Starting Position\n\n**\u274c MISTAKE:** Starting from standing, then leaning into the sled as you begin pushing.\n\n**\u2705 FIX:** Set position BEFORE first push\u2014already at 45-degree angle, hands placed, core braced.\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf WHY IT WORKS:** The first 3 steps are the hardest\u2014you're breaking static friction. You need maximum power output immediately. Starting from a standing position wastes that crucial first push. Set your position with intention, then explode.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Hand Position Setup\n\n\n\n**Hands shoulder-width apart**(not too narrow)\n\n\n\n**Firm grip**but not death-grip (save forearm energy)\n\n\n\n**Arms bent 90-120 degrees**(elbows in, ready to transmit power)\n\n### Body Position Check\n\n\n\n**Hips below shoulders**(45-degree torso lean\u2014this is critical)\n\n\n\n**Weight on midfoot**ready to drive through heels\n\n\n\n**Core braced hard**(360-degree tension)\n\n\n\n**Glutes engaged**before first step\n\n\n\n**Head neutral**eyes 6 feet ahead on ground",

HYROX Burpee Broad Jump Mistakes to Avoid in 2026\n\n### Inadequate Jump Distance\n\nA short jump will cost you time and energy, meaning you have to do a higher volume of burpees to cover the same distance. If you jump short you also won\u2019t fully engage the target muscles, particularly the glutes and hamstrings.\n\nEnsure you leap with enough force to cover a substantial distance, thereby maximising muscle engagement and workout efficacy.\n\n\u2026\n\n## 7. Benefits of a HYROX Burpee Broad Jump \u2013 The Science Stuff\n\n### Metabolic Afterburn: EPOC in Action\n\nThe burpee broad jump is a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) exercise, which triggers Excess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption (EPOC).\n\nThis means your body continues to consume more oxygen and burn calories for hours after the workout. Studies show that EPOC can increase your metabolic rate by up to 15% for up to 48 hours.\n\n\u2026\n\n## FAQ\u2019s\n\n### How far are the broad jumps at the HYROX burpee?\n\nIn HYROX the\n\n**burpee broad jump station covers a total of 80 metres** of forward movement where you repeat a burpee followed immediately by a broad jump until you cross that 80 m marker.\n\n### How to do burpee broad jump for HYROX?\n\nA proper HYROX burpee broad jump reps consists of:\n\n**Burpee first:**hands behind the start line, chest touches the floor. **Stand up:**you may step or jump back up, but feet **can\u2019t pass your fingertips**when rising. **Broad jump:**both feet must take off and land together, **parallel**, with no extra steps between reps.\n\n- You keep repeating burpee \u2192 broad jump until you\u2019ve covered 80 m.\n\n### How many burpee broad jumps in 80m HYROX?\n\nThe number of reps varies by how far you jump each time. Most athletes take roughly\n\n**40\u201360 reps** to cover the full 80 m distance, but stronger jumpers might use fewer reps if their leaps are longer.",

          "snippet": "**The push off:** as we\u2019ve previously mentioned perhaps **the hardest part of the sled push is getting the sled to start moving in the first place**. No matter your chosen technique, we always recommend a two-foot push off.\n\nYou will want to maximize your weight through momentum, so plant your feet steadily and then let yourself \u201cfall forward\u201d against the sled.\nCouple that first bout of momentum with a strong push from both legs once you\u2019ve made contact with the sled. Once your body is fully extended against the sled, start with your strides.\n\n**THE TECHNIQUES**\n\nThere are three commonly used variations of the sled push that you should know about and train to find the perfect fit for you.\nWe\u2019d argue this is the variation most favored by rookies and especially men. Hands are usually place in the upper third of the sled poles. You will be pushing the sled from a \u201cfront rack\u201d position where you arms are fully bent and your shoulders are one the same plane of your hands and the sled poles BUT are NOT making contact with either.\n\n\u2026\n\n**We call it full lock out as you will have your arms fully extended**, elbow possibly locked out if you are comfortable with it, and we also recommend pushing some extension in your upper back to create a more stacked position that will tire you out less as you move the sled.\n\nHands should go in the middle section of the sled poles to avoid creating odd angles of force that might make it feel heavier.\nWhen completing the first step of the sled push and utilizing the full lockout technique, make sure to immediately start with your arms already locked out as pressing the sled with your arms will tire them out for nothing.\n\nYou might have seen this technique\n\n**used by pro athletes, especially men who weigh enough** to use their body \u201cagainst\u201d the sled.\nThe athlete will place their hands towards the end of the sled poles, fingers facing down, and then \u201cwrap their arms\u201d around the poles, letting their shoulders physically rest against the top of the poles.\n\nThis technique can be \u201cpassive\u201d, allowing the upper body to rest.\n\nOr more \u201cactive\u201d with the athlete almost actively pulling onto the sled poles in order to pull up his side of the sled and take away some of the weight-bearing down on the floor.\n\n\u2026\n\nThis is thanks to the removal of the eccentric phase which can be the most stressful for knees, hips and ankles.\n\nDepending on variation chosen, you will be able to focus on quad development or more classic \u201cposterior chain\u201d (think glutes and hamstrings). Because of these reasons, it\u2019s also a\n\n**great implement in any return-to-training rehab process post injury**.",

Ideally, this is something to find out in training, or in the warmup area at HYROX, prior to the start of your race.",

You can take as long as you need to finish, and the crowd will still cheer just as loud when you cross that line. HYROX is about personal challenge, not just competition.\n\n#### Typical time breakdown\n\n#### \u201cGood\u201d benchmark goals\n\nIf you\u2019re training for your first HYROX and want a rough benchmark:\n\n**Under 100 mins:**Strong first-timer, well-balanced fitness. **Around 110 mins:**Solid finish with steady pacing. **Under 90 mins:**You\u2019ve officially caught the HYROX bug, and trained well!\n\n\u2026\n\n#### Timing at the venue\n\n- Arrive 60\u201390 minutes before your wave\n\n- Bag drop and restroom first\n\n- Walk the Roxzone entry and exit paths\n\n- Locate start pen early\n\n#### Roxzone habits that save minutes\n\n- Keep moving with small steps, breathe through the nose on entry\n\n- Set equipment once, avoid re-adjusting mid-station\n\n- Exit decisively, settle into run pace in the first 50\u2013100 meters\n\n\u2026\n\n#### 4. Station strategy\n\nEach workout station has its own pacing trick:\n\n**SkiErg / Row:**Keep strokes smooth and steady. Save power for the finish. **Sled Push / Pull:**Use short bursts, then rest 3\u20135 seconds instead of grinding nonstop. **Burpees / Wall Balls:**Break reps into manageable sets early\u201410s or 15s\u2014and stick to your plan. **Farmer\u2019s Carry / Lunges:**Focus on posture and breathing; these stations are about control, not speed.",

          "snippet": "When broken down to its core components,\n\n**the sled pull requires some degree of upper body pulling,** which can be the only moving force at play or can be coupled with a certain amount of leg pressing and hip extension to help you move the sled faster, more explosively or overall move a heavier sled.\n\n\u2026\n\nThere are three main types of techniques used to perform a pull.\n\nThese can then be matched together to create \u201chybrid\u201d versions. They are:\n\nThis is the most upper body dominant variation. One you will see often in fitness photoshoots and similar ads.\n\nIt allows to increase upper body strength and pulling capacity while removing the eccentric phase of the movement making it less harsh on the joints.\n\n\u2026\n\nWith our HYROX athletes and within our HYROX program we recommend using and training a specific hybrid technique that mixes the initial pull of a hip drive with the backward walk technique.\n\n**Step 1 **\n\nNo matter the technique you will be choosing, the sled pull always starts with the same set up.\n\nGrab the rope and pull it until there is no slack left, the ropes in HYROX races can have some degree of give or stretch, so make sure you are creating sufficient tension.\nOnce the rope is taught, sit back into your hips almost as if you were setting up for a deadlift but with a prouder chest. While you do this your arms should still be bent at about 90 degrees at the elbow.\n\nDepending on your mobility, strength and how much force you\u2019ll need to move the sled, your hips will be slightly higher or lower, but you\u2019ll likely be somewhere just below parallel compared to your knees or a few degrees above.\nWhat happens next will depend on your technique of choice.\n\n**Step 2 **\n\nMaking sure your core is tight, and you\u2019re hanging back in your hips you will reach as far as possible with one arm, grab and pull. Repeat this, alternating arms until you have completed your desired distance.\n\nBecause you want to maximize inertia and therefore never allow the sled to come to a stop make the pulls fast even if it means slightly shortening each pull.\n**Step 2**\n\nSet up will be similar but this time your arms will be holding the rope almost completely extended and NOT bent. Once you are in position, you will press through the floor with your legs while explosively extending your hips.\n\n**Step 3**\n\nThe inertia created by the explosiveness of Step 2 will give you enough momentum to finish the pull through the arms so that you can maximize every centimeter of each pull.\n**Step 2 **\n\nAfter setting up you will utilize the resistance of the rope and sled to lean further back not just with your hips but torso as well. This will move your center of balance backwards enough to put the sled in motion. For this variation we recommend also keeping your arms extended while holding the rope to not excessively fatigue your biceps.\n**Step 3**\n\nOnce you\u2019re effectively \u201cfalling backwards\u201d use that momentum to step back and make sure to press through the floor with your supporting leg with each step while keeping tension in the rope.\n\nWhen you are forced to stay within a 2 m box you need to be highly aware of where you are placing the excess rope you leave behind as you pull.",

          "snippet": "In this article, I\u2019ll take you through what I\u2019ve learned about pacing a HYROX, from personal experience, helping our coaching clients, and from diving into the data.\n\n**Keep It Consistent**\n\nIn our \u201cAverage to Elite\u201d article, we highlighted that the best performers in HYROX appeared to pace their runs more consistently than those who achieved an average HYROX time (which is about 90mins). This was particularly the case for the men. That perhaps shouldn\u2019t be a surprise as a study has shown that women were 18.33% better than men at keeping an even pace in a marathon.\n\n\u2026\n\nI\u2019ll also know how my target time translates to the amount of time I need to run\n\n**per lap** of the track. I use the venue floor plan to help do this in the days prior to the race. Let\u2019s say that 1km is 2.5 laps of the track. If I want to hit a running split of 4:30mins/km, it means I need to run 1 lap of the track in about 1:48mins.\n\n\u2026\n\n**First Run**\n\nYou also need to consider that the first run can be shorter, or longer, depending on where the Start line is. I will calculate, in advance, how long I want that first run to take. If I estimate the first run to be 100meters shorter, for example, then I\u2019d be looking for my first run to be 90% of my normal running split times. If my 1km time aim is 4:30mins, then that first run at 90%, would be 4:03mins.\n\n\u2026\n\nTo do this I will start to run (on an athletics track) and steadily bring my heart rate up to that level. Then I\u2019ll hit the start timer on my watch, and time how long it takes me to run 1km whilst maintaining my heart rate at an average of 155bpm. You may need to adjust your HR target depending on your age, max heart rate, and how comfortable you feel over extended periods of time at certain heart rates. I have found that the time I take to do this is, roughly speaking, a good pace for me to aim for at HYROX.",

          "snippet": "# Wall Balls Workout\n\nThe Wall Balls station is a demanding test of full-body strength and coordination in HYROX races. This exercise requires participants to perform wall ball shots, a movement combining a squat and a throw, using a weighted ball.\n\n##### Key Rules\n- The athlete must start standing tall, holding the wall ball with both hands.\n\n- The athlete then squats and throws the ball (with both hands), striking the correct target as they stand up - this is counted as one repetition.\n\n- Each wall ball throw must strike the designated target i.e. female athletes must hit their target in the center, male athletes must hit their target in the center.\n\n\u2026\n\n- At the referee's discretion a box may be used to ensure the athlete\u2019s squat is low enough.\n\n- If the athlete violates any of the above mentioned points, the repetition becomes invalid.\n\nThe number of repetitions and the weight of the ball will change based on your category:\n\n\n\n**Women**75 reps with 4 kg (white marking)\n**Women Pro / Men**100 reps with 6 kg (grey marking)\n\n\n\n**Men Pro**100 reps with 9 kg (black marking)\n\nThe target height will change based on your category:\n\n\n\n**Target height Women and Women Pro**2.70m\n\n\n\n**Target height Men and Men Pro**3.00m",

          "snippet": "### Completing the Distance\n\nThe sled pull requires you to complete four 12.5-meter lengths. You\u2019ll need to pull the sled until it crosses the front line of your box before switching sides or partners.\n\nIn the\n\n**doubles division**, partners can switch at any time during the length, but the non-working partner must remain behind and cannot assist with the rope. If the rope coils underfoot, it\u2019s the responsibility of the working partner to clear it, so stay aware of its position.\n\n## Optimal Sled Pull Technique\n\nYour pulling technique will depend on the weight of the sled and your strength. Below are the techniques that can be used in both the open and pro divisions to ensure maximum efficiency.\n\n### 1. Take the Slack Out of the Rope\n\nBefore beginning your pull, make sure to eliminate any slack in the rope. The ropes used in Hyrox races are slightly stretchy, so starting with slack will lead to wasted effort. Position yourself, grab the rope, and pull until all slack is gone before you begin exerting force to move the sled.\n\n### 2. Set Up Like a Deadlift\n\nA strong sled pull begins with proper posture. Your setup should resemble a deadlift position: feet under your hips, a neutral spine, and tension in your legs and glutes. This solid base allows you to drive through your feet and move the sled with maximum force.\n\nOnce in position, your movement strategy will vary depending on the technique you use. Let\u2019s look at the three main techniques:\n\n### 3. Hand-Over-Hand Method\n\nThe\n\n**hand-over-hand method** is primarily used by athletes with strong upper bodies. In this technique, you pull the rope by moving your hands one over the other, relying heavily on your biceps. **Short, Choppy Pulls**: Avoid large, sweeping arm movements. Instead, use short, quick pulls to keep the sled moving steadily. **Frequent Reps**: Since each pull moves the sled only a small distance, expect to perform many reps. This technique is effective but can fatigue the arms quickly, so practice is essential if you want to use it during the race.\n\n### 4. Hip Extension Method\n\nThe\n\n**hip extension method** is a more powerful technique, especially useful when the sled is heavier. This method engages your entire body, not just your arms. **Drive Through the Floor**: After eliminating slack from the rope, drive your feet into the ground while pulling the sled toward you. Use your legs and glutes to generate the majority of your force. **Squeeze Your Glutes**: Once your legs have driven the sled forward, bring your hips through by squeezing your glutes and pulling with your arms simultaneously. This method allows for more movement with each pull, reducing the total number of pulls needed.\n\n### 5. Walk-Back Method\n\nThe\n\n**walk-back method** is commonly used in the **pro division**, where the sled is much heavier. In this technique, athletes leverage their body weight to move the sled while walking backward. **Leverage Body Weight**: After the initial setup (feet under hips, tension out of the rope), drive your hips forward as in the hip extension method. Then, lean back with your arms straight, allowing your body weight to help pull the sled. **Keep Arms Straight**: Keeping your arms extended during this movement reduces strain on your muscles and ensures a more consistent pull.\n\n\u2026\n\n### 2. Poor Body Position\n\nAthletes often set up in positions that limit their power output. Rounding your back or standing too upright reduces your ability to generate force. Instead, focus on setting up with a neutral spine and engaging your legs and core to maximize efficiency.\n\n### 3. Inefficient Hand-Over-Hand Pulls\n\nWhen using the hand-over-hand technique, some athletes take large, sweeping pulls, which can waste energy and slow the sled\u2019s movement. Instead, keep your movements short and choppy for faster, more controlled progress.\n\n## Final Tips for Sled Pull Success\n\n**Practice Multiple Techniques**: It\u2019s a good idea to practice all three techniques (hand-over-hand, hip extension, and walk-back) to find the one that works best for you, especially as the weight increases. **Work on Grip Strength**: The sled pull is one of the few Hyrox movements that relies heavily on your grip.\nMake sure your grip strength is up to the task, particularly if you\u2019re planning to use the hand-over-hand method. **Use Your Body Weight**: In the walk-back method, don\u2019t underestimate the power of leveraging your body weight. Leaning back effectively will save you energy while moving the sled faster.\n\nBy refining your technique and avoiding common faults, you\u2019ll be able to move the sled efficiently, saving valuable energy for the rest of the race.",

          "snippet": "You wouldn't run a marathon without a pacing plan. So why race HYROX without one?\n\n**The problem:** Most athletes show up with a vague goal (\"go sub-1:30\") but no concrete plan for how to get there. They go out too fast, blow up on stations 3-4, and limp through the final wall balls\u2014wondering what went wrong.\n\n**The solution:** A data-driven pacing strategy that breaks your goal time into achievable splits for each segment.\n\nThis guide teaches you\n\n**how to build a smart pacing plan** using our Pacing Calculator\u2014and more importantly, **how to execute it on race day.**\n\n#### Key Takeaway\n\nAthletes who pace evenly (within 10% variance across runs) finish 5-10% faster than those who sprint early and fade late. Pacing isn't about holding back\u2014it's about distributing effort optimally.\n\n## Why Pacing Matters in HYROX\n\nHYROX is unique: it's\n\n**8km of running + 8 stations** done back-to-back with minimal rest.\n\n**The pacing challenge:**\n\n- Start too fast \u2192 blow up by station 4\n\n- Start too slow \u2192 leave time on the table\n\n- Uneven effort \u2192 waste energy on recovery\n\n**The data shows:**\n\nAthletes who pace strategically finish significantly faster than those who \"wing it.\"\n\n## The 3 Core Pacing Strategies\n\nThere are three main approaches to HYROX pacing. Your choice depends on your fitness level and goals.\n\n### Strategy 1: Negative Split (Beginner-Friendly)\n\n**What it means:**\n\nStart conservative, finish strong. Early runs are slower than late runs.\n\n**Who it's for:**\n\n- First-time racers\n\n- Athletes unsure of their fitness\n\n- Anyone prioritizing \"finish strong\" over \"optimal time\"\n\n**Example (1:45 goal):**\n\n- Runs 1-3: 5:45/km\n\n- Runs 4-6: 5:30/km\n\n- Runs 7-8: 5:15/km\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Lower risk of blowing up\n\n- Mentally satisfying (passing people late)\n\n- Easier to adjust mid-race\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Not the fastest possible time\n\n- Leaves potential on the table\n\n### Strategy 2: Even Pacing (The Sweet Spot)\n\n**What it means:**\n\nConsistent effort across all runs and stations. Minimal variance.\n\n**Who it's for:**\n\n- Experienced athletes\n\n- Those targeting a specific time\n\n- Athletes with strong fitness and mental discipline\n\n**Example (1:30 goal):**\n\n- All runs: 5:00-5:15/km\n\n- All stations: race-weight training time \u00b110%\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Maximizes efficiency\n\n- Optimal for most athletes\n\n- Predictable energy expenditure\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Requires discipline (fighting urge to sprint early)\n\n- Less room for error\n\nEven pacing is the gold standard for HYROX. Unless you're elite or a complete beginner, aim for this strategy.\n\n### Strategy 3: Controlled Fast Start (Advanced Only)\n\n**What it means:**\n\nRun the first 3-4 runs slightly faster than target, then hold on.\n\n**Who it's for:**\n\n- Elite athletes (sub-1:15 men, sub-1:24 women)\n\n- Strong runners with excellent fitness\n\n- Competitive racers targeting podiums\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Builds early time cushion\n\n- Works if you're strong at running but weaker at stations\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- High risk of blowing up\n\n- One bad station = race falls apart\n\n**Our recommendation:** Unless you're elite, stick with **Strategy 2 (Even Pacing).**\n\n## How to Use the HyroxDataLab Pacing Calculator\n\nOur Pacing Calculator does the math for you.\n\n### Step 1: Input Your Goal Time\n\nExample:\n\n**1:35:00**\n\n**How to set a realistic goal:**\n\n- First race: Add 10-15% to training simulations\n\n- Returning racer: Aim for 5-10% improvement\n\n- Use our benchmark guide for reference\n\n### Step 2: Review Your Target Splits\n\nThe calculator outputs:\n\n**Run Paces:**Each 1km run target (accounting for fatigue) **Station Times:**Expected times for all 8 stations **RoxZone Budget:**Transition time (aim for 1:00-1:30 per transition)\n\n### Step 3: Adjust for Your Strengths/Weaknesses\n\n**The calculator gives you a baseline.** Now personalize it:\n\n**If you're a strong runner:**\n\n- Subtract 10-15 seconds from each run split\n\n- Add 15-20 seconds to your weakest 2 stations\n\n**If you're strong at stations:**\n\n- Subtract 15-30 seconds from your fastest 2 stations\n\n- Add 15-20 seconds to run splits\n\n## Breaking Down a 1:30:00 Goal Time\n\n|Segment|Target|Cumulative|Notes|\n|--|--|--|--|\n|Run 1|5:15|5:15|Start controlled|\n|SkiErg|4:30|9:45|Smooth, 70-80%|\n|RoxZone|1:05|10:50|Jog to next run|\n|Run 2|5:20|16:10|Find rhythm|\n|Sled Push (152kg/102kg)|3:30|19:40|Low, fast feet|\n|RoxZone|1:05|20:45|Quick reset|\n|Run 3|5:25|26:10|Slight slowdown OK|\n|Sled Pull (103kg/78kg)|4:00|30:10|Steady pulls|\n|RoxZone|1:05|31:15|Mental check|\n|Run 4|5:25|36:40|Halfway point|\n|Burpees (80m)|6:00|42:40|Sets of 10|\n|RoxZone|1:05|43:45|Stay moving|\n|Run 5|5:30|49:15|The grind|\n|Row (1000m)|4:45|54:00|Legs + pull|\n|RoxZone|1:05|55:05|3 left|\n|Run 6|5:35|1:00:40|Maintain|\n|Farmers (48kg/32kg)|2:30|1:03:10|Don't drop|\n|RoxZone|1:05|1:04:15|Almost there|\n|Run 7|5:40|1:09:55|2 stations|\n|Lunges (20kg/10kg)|5:30|1:15:25|Small steps|\n|RoxZone|1:05|1:16:30|Final push|\n|Run 8|5:40|1:22:10|Last run|\n|Wall Balls (100)|6:30|1:28:40|Unbroken sets|\n|RoxZone|1:20|1:30:00|Sprint finish|\n|Finish|\u2014|1:30:00|Done!|\n**RoxZone** includes running from finish line \u2192 station \u2192 next run start. Elite: 4-5 min total. Intermediate: 7-9 min. Every 30 seconds saved per transition = 4 minutes off your total time!\n\n## Pacing Adjustments During the Race\n\nNo plan survives first contact. Here's how to adapt:\n\n### If You're Ahead of Schedule\n\n**Don't celebrate yet.** Being 2 minutes ahead after 3 stations often means you started too fast.\n\n**What to do:**\n\n- Check effort level: Breathing heavily? Legs burning?\n\n- Assess remaining stations: Weakest ones still ahead?\n\n**Decision:**If you feel great, maintain (don't speed up). If working hard, slow 5-10%.\n\nBetter to finish 1 minute ahead than blow up and finish 3 minutes behind your goal.\n\n### If You're Behind Schedule\n\n**Don't panic.** Being 2 minutes behind after 3 stations is recoverable.\n\n**What to do:**\n\n- Identify the problem: Which stations/runs were slow?\n\n- Adjust realistically: Don't try to \"make up 2 minutes\" in one station\n\n**Recovery Strategy:**\n\n- Save 15-20 sec on each remaining run (if possible)\n\n- Shave 10-15 sec off RoxZone transitions\n\n- Go harder on your strongest remaining station\n\n## Common Pacing Mistakes (& How to Avoid)\n\n### Mistake #1: \"I'll Just Go Hard and See What Happens\"\n\n**Why it fails:**\n\nYou blow up by station 4, suffer through 5-8, finish 5-10 minutes slower than potential.\n\n**Fix:**\n\nBuild a plan. Even a rough plan beats no plan.\n\n### Mistake #2: Ignoring Fatigue Accumulation\n\n**Why it fails:**\n\nYou pace run 1 perfectly but don't account for cumulative fatigue. By run 7, you're 30 sec/km slower.\n\n**Fix:**\n\nBuild fatigue into your plan. Expect runs 5-8 to be 10-20 sec/km slower than runs 1-2.\n\n### Mistake #3: Racing on Feeling, Not Data\n\n**Why it fails:**\n\nAdrenaline makes run 1 feel \"easy,\" so you go 30 seconds too fast. By run 4, you're cooked.\n\n**Fix:**\n\nWear a GPS watch. Check pace every 500m. Trust data > feelings.\n\n### Mistake #4: Not Practicing Your Pace\n\n**Why it fails:**\n\nYou've never run 5:15/km pace under fatigue. On race day, you don't know what it feels like.\n\n**Fix:**\n\nDo\n\n**race-pace simulations** in training.\n\n## Sample Pacing Plans by Goal Time\n\n### 2:00:00 Goal (Beginner)\n\n|Segment|Target|\n|--|--|\n|Runs (avg)|6:30/km|\n|SkiErg|6:00|\n|Sled Push (152kg/102kg)|5:00|\n|Sled Pull (103kg/78kg)|6:00|\n|Burpees|9:00|\n|Row|6:00|\n|Farmers (48kg/32kg)|4:00|\n|Lunges (20kg/10kg)|8:00|\n|Wall Balls|8:00|\n|RoxZone|11:00|\n### 1:30:00 Goal (Intermediate)\n\n|Segment|Target|\n|--|--|\n|Runs (avg)|5:25/km|\n|SkiErg|4:30|\n|Sled Push (152kg/102kg)|3:30|\n|Sled Pull (103kg/78kg)|4:00|\n|Burpees|6:00|\n|Row|4:45|\n|Farmers (48kg/32kg)|2:30|\n|Lunges (20kg/10kg)|5:30|\n|Wall Balls|6:30|\n|RoxZone|9:00|\n### 1:10:00 Goal (Elite)\n\n|Segment|Target|\n|--|--|\n|Runs (avg)|4:30/km|\n|SkiErg|3:50|\n|Sled Push (152kg/102kg)|2:30|\n|Sled Pull (103kg/78kg)|3:00|\n|Burpees|4:30|\n|Row|3:50|\n|Farmers (48kg/32kg)|1:55|\n|Lunges (20kg/10kg)|4:15|\n|Wall Balls|4:30|\n|RoxZone|5:00|\n## Your Race Day Pacing Checklist\n\n**1 Week Before:**\n\n- Finalize goal time based on training\n\n- Build pacing plan (use calculator)\n\n- Write splits on your arm or wrist band\n\n**Race Morning:**\n\n- Set lap alerts on GPS watch (every 1km)\n\n- Warm up with pace checks (200m at goal pace)\n\n- Visualize first 3 stations (commit to plan)\n\n**During Race:**\n\n- Check watch every 500m (stay on pace)\n\n- Mental checkpoints: \"How do I feel?

You executed a plan.\n\n## Conclusion: Pace Smart, Race Fast\n\nHYROX is not about who can suffer the most. It's about who can\n\n**distribute suffering most efficiently.**\n\nA smart pacing plan:\n\n- Prevents early blowups\n\n- Maximizes your fitness potential\n\n- Builds confidence (you know what to expect)\n\n- Saves minutes (vs. winging it)\n\n#### Key Takeaway\n\nThe best pacing plan is the one you can actually execute. Start conservative, adjust as you learn, and finish strong.

What is the HYROX Burpee Broad Jump?\n\nThe HYROX Burpee Broad Jump is a combo move: a traditional burpee followed by a forward leap. This is done repeatedly until you cover a distance of 80m and is the 4th exercise station in HYROX.\n\nAt the point of the HYROX Race in which you start the Burpee Broad Jumps, you will already have completed; 1km Run, 1000m Ski Erg, 1km Run, 50m Sled Push, 1km Run, 50m Sled Pull and 1km Run.\n\nStraight after the Burpees Broad Jumps you will complete; 1km Run, 1000m Row, 1km Run, 200m Kettle Bells Farmers Carry, 1km Run, 100m Sandbag Lunges, 1km Run and 100 Wall Balls to complete the race.\n\n## 2. HYROX Burpee Broad Jump Movement Standards\n\n- The athlete starts with both hands behind the line.\n\n- The starting position is in the upright position, hands placed near feet, at most one foot length away. Once the hands are placed on the ground they cannot be moved forward.\n\n- In the lower position, the athlete\u2019s chest must touch the ground.\n\n- Then, the athlete stands up and jumps forward, jumping and landing with both feet simultaneously.\n\n- The length of the jump is up to the athlete.\n\n- Taking any steps forward between the repetitions is not allowed.\n\n- The station is completed, once the athlete jumps across the finish line.\n\n- If the athlete violates any of the above mentioned points, the repetition becomes invalid and in the second warning the athlete receives a 5m distance penalty.\n\n- Distance 80 m (unless penalties are assessed)\n\nVisit the HYROX Rules Book for more information.\n\n## 3. Average HYROX Burpee Broad Jump Times\n\nIf not taken seriously, the Burpee Broad Jumps can significantly slow your HYROX race.\n\nThe HYROX 2026 average Burpee Broad Jump times for each category were;\n\n**Singles:** **Womens Open:**07:09 **Womens Pro:**05:22 **Mens Open:**05:45 **Mens Pro:**04:35\n\n**Doubles:** **Womens Doubles:**04:24 **Mens Doubles:**03:16 **Mixed Doubles:**03:40\n\n**Relays:**\n\n**Mixed Relay:** 05:01\n\n**Mens Relay:** 04:58\n\n**Womens Relay:** 06:10\n\nThe master tips below will help you perfect your technique and energy efficiency to breeze through this element of your HYROX race and take a step closer to the elite times.\n\nData Courtesy of https://www.theroxzone.com\n\n## 4. Tips to Master your HYROX Burpee Broad Jump in 2026\n\nThe YouTube video above shows tips on perfecting your technique.\n\n### The Perfect Launch Position\n\nThe key to a quick and efficient burpee broad jump starts with your launch position. Keep your feet shoulder-width apart and your core engaged. This sets the stage for a powerful jump and a smooth landing back into the burpee.\n\n### Arm Swing Mechanics\n\nDon\u2019t underestimate the power of good arm swing technique. As you jump, swing your arms forward to generate additional momentum. This not only helps you jump farther but also keeps your body balanced.\n\n### Quick Recovery for the Next Rep\n\nLanding softly and transitioning immediately into the next burpee is vital for maintaining speed. The quicker you can get back into the burpee position, the quicker you can complete the reps and cover the 80m distance. It\u2019s all about that bounce-back!\n\n### Optimal Footwear and Gear\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t run a marathon in flip-flops, would you? The same logic applies here. Choose lightweight, grippy shoes for better traction and more efficient jumps. And as for clothing, go for moisture-wicking fabrics that allow maximum mobility.\n\n### Master the Breath\n\nYour breath is your secret weapon. Inhale deeply as you go down into the burpee and exhale forcefully as you launch into the jump. This optimises oxygen flow to your muscles, giving you that extra oomph.\n\n### Consistent Training Equals Consistent Gains\n\nConsistency is your best friend. Incorporate burpee broad jumps into your regular workout routine, gradually increasing the number of reps and sets.\n\nThis will build both your anaerobic endurance and your overall speed to master the burpee broad jump.\n\n### 3 Bonus Tips from HYROX Master Trainer Jade Skillen\n\n## 5. What Muscle Groups Do HYROX Burpee Broad Jumps Target?\n\n### The Burpee Phase: The Launchpad\n\n**Quadriceps and Calves:** Your quads and calves are the stars of the show during the burpee phase. They help you spring back up from the ground, setting the stage for a powerful broad jump.\n\n### The Broad Jump Phase: The Flight\n\n**Hamstrings and Glutes:** These bad boys are your main engines during the broad jump. They provide the explosive force needed to launch you forward like a human rocket.\n\n**Core:** Your core muscles are always on duty, ensuring you don\u2019t end up doing a faceplant. They help maintain your balance and make sure the power from your legs is effectively transferred into that glorious leap.\n\n### Throughout the Exercise: The Sustainers\n\n**Upper Body:** Your chest, shoulders, and triceps get a workout too, especially during the push-up part of the burpee. They\u2019re the unsung heroes that keep the upper body engaged.\n\n**Erector Spinae:** These muscles run along your spine and help you maintain an upright position throughout the exercise. A strong back means you can perform more reps without compromising form.\n\n### The Grip: Holding It Together\n\n**Forearms and Hands:** Your grip strength comes into play when you hit the ground during the burpee. A strong grip helps you push off effectively and maintain good form.\n\n### The Cardio Element: Your Internal Engine\n\n**Heart and Lungs:** The HYROX Burpee Broad Jump (Along with all the other HYROX Exercises) is as much a test of your cardiovascular fitness as it is of your muscle strength.\n\nYour heart and lungs work in overdrive to keep you fuelled and ready for the next rep.\n\nSo there you have it, a quick rundown of the muscle groups that are begging for mercy during your HYROX Burpee Broad Jumps.\n\n## 6. HYROX Burpee Broad Jump Mistakes to Avoid in 2026\n\n### Inadequate Jump Distance\n\nA short jump will cost you time and energy, meaning you have to do a higher volume of burpees to cover the same distance. If you jump short you also won\u2019t fully engage the target muscles, particularly the glutes and hamstrings.\n\nEnsure you leap with enough force to cover a substantial distance, thereby maximising muscle engagement and workout efficacy.\n\n### Incorrect Stance\n\nA proper stance is crucial for stability and power. Your feet should be shoulder-width apart to provide a stable base for both the burpee and the jump. An incorrect stance can compromise your balance and limit your power output.\n\n### Uncontrolled Burpees\n\nConsistency is key. Performing burpees in an erratic manner can lead to early fatigue and less energy efficiency. Aim for smooth, controlled movements to maintain a steady rhythm and better muscle engagement.\n\n### Poor Back Posture\n\nMaintaining a straight back is essential for proper form and to avoid strain or injury. Overarching the back can disrupt energy transfer and compromise the exercise\u2019s effectiveness. Keep your core engaged to support a straight back throughout the movement.\n\n### Weak Hand Placement\n\nDuring the burpee phase, your hand placement on the ground should be firm to support your body weight effectively. A weak grip can lead to instability and disrupt the flow of the exercise.\n\n### Inconsistent Breathing\n\nProper breathing is vital for optimal performance and stamina. Maintain a rhythmic breathing pattern\u2014inhale during the burpee and exhale during the jump\u2014to ensure efficient oxygen supply to your muscles.\n\n### Underutilising Hip Power\n\nThe hips play a significant role in generating the force needed for the broad jump. Failing to engage your hips effectively can result in a weaker jump and reduced muscle engagement. Focus on using your hips to propel yourself forward in the jump phase.\n\n## 7. Benefits of a HYROX Burpee Broad Jump \u2013 The Science Stuff\n\n### Metabolic Afterburn: EPOC in Action\n\nThe burpee broad jump is a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) exercise, which triggers Excess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption (EPOC).\n\nThis means your body continues to consume more oxygen and burn calories for hours after the workout. Studies show that EPOC can increase your metabolic rate by up to 15% for up to 48 hours.\n\n### Neuromuscular Benefits: Proprioception and Motor Skills\n\nThe complex movements involved in the burpee broad jump enhance your proprioceptive abilities. Research indicates that proprioception improves neuromuscular junction efficiency, meaning better balance and coordination.\n\n### Targeted Muscle Activation: A Biomechanical Perspective\n\n**Quadriceps**: Engaged during the squat and jump phases, aiding in knee extension. **Glutes**: Activated during the hip extension in both the burpee and the jump. **Hamstrings**: Work during the squat phase to control knee flexion. **Core Muscles**: Engaged throughout to stabilise the spine, reducing the risk of lower back injuries. **Pectorals and Triceps**: Used during the push-up phase, promoting upper body strength.\n\n### Joint Health: Low-Impact, High Reward\n\nThe burpee broad jump is a plyometric exercise, which means it\u2019s designed to produce fast, powerful movements. Plyometrics have been shown to improve joint health by enhancing the production of synovial fluid, which lubricates the joints.\n\n### Cardiovascular Conditioning: VO2 Max and Heart Rate\n\nThis exercise can elevate your heart rate to about 80-90% of its maximum, improving your cardiovascular fitness and increasing your VO2 Max\u2014a key indicator of aerobic endurance.\n\n### Aerobic and Anaerobic Benefits: Dual Fuelling Systems\n\nThe burpee broad jump works both your aerobic and anaerobic systems. Studies have shown that this dual approach can improve mitochondrial density, enhancing your cells\u2019 ability to produce energy.\n\n### Psychological Resilience: Neurochemical Changes\n\nThe intense physical exertion releases endorphins, your body\u2019s natural mood lifters. It also increases the production of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), which has been linked to improved cognitive function and mental resilience.\n\n### Functional Fitness: Real-World Applications\n\nThe explosive power and agility gained from this exercise have direct applications in daily life, from sprinting for a bus to lifting heavy objects.\n\n### Injury Prevention: Kinetic Chain Reinforcement\n\nThe full-body engagement in burpee broad jumps strengthens the kinetic chain, reducing muscle imbalances and the risk of injuries related to overuse or improper form.\n\n## Wrapping Up\n\nSo there you have it, a brutal exercise with fantastic physiological benefits.\n\nWhen trained in the right way they\u2019re a key component in increasing your athletic performance.\n\nRegulate you breathing, keep your movement rhythm and you\u2019ll be at the 80m line and into the next run before you know it.\n\nA bit of time mastering the basics of this movement goes a long way.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re new to HYROX try our 6 Week HYROX Training Plan for Beginners to get you started.\n\n## FAQ\u2019s\n\n### How far are the broad jumps at the HYROX burpee?\n\nIn HYROX the\n\n**burpee broad jump station covers a total of 80 metres** of forward movement where you repeat a burpee followed immediately by a broad jump until you cross that 80 m marker.\n\n### How to do burpee broad jump for HYROX?\n\nA proper HYROX burpee broad jump reps consists of:\n\n**Burpee first:**hands behind the start line, chest touches the floor. **Stand up:**you may step or jump back up, but feet **can\u2019t pass your fingertips**when rising. **Broad jump:**both feet must take off and land together, **parallel**, with no extra steps between reps.\n\n- You keep repeating burpee \u2192 broad jump until you\u2019ve covered 80 m.\n\n### How many burpee broad jumps in 80m HYROX?\n\nThe number of reps varies by how far you jump each time. Most athletes take roughly\n\n**40\u201360 reps** to cover the full 80 m distance, but stronger jumpers might use fewer reps if their leaps are longer.\n\n### What are burpee broad jumps good for?\n\nBurpee broad jumps are a\n\n**full-body, high-intensity movement** that build:\n\n**Cardiovascular endurance** under fatigue\n\nThey test your ability to transition quickly from a ground-based strength move (burpee) into an explosive jump, which pushes your heart rate and muscular stamina hard in a race environment.\n\n**Explosive leg power and hip drive**\n\n**Upper-body strength and core stability**\n\n",

But what exactly would be considered a big set? To me, it's 50 plus. If you can come in there and knock\n{ts:54} out half of the wall balls right away, you're setting yourself up for such an easier time in the long term.\nBut if you\n{ts:61} don't have 50 wall balls, that's just not something that's in your ability. Then you should do smaller sets and\n{ts:66} reps. And having a plan during this portion so that you understand how many you can do while maintaining consistent.\n{ts:73} So that could pick any number.\n\n\u2026\n\nSo, one thing that I recommend that you do is play around\n{ts:163} with the breathing sequence to make sure that what you're doing is optimal and to not just like fall into these patterns\n{ts:169} because that's the way you think that they should be. So, really what I would recommend is completely flipping it.\n\n\u2026\n\nI just thought you just did them and everybody was kind of the same and it was a matter of who didn't break\n{ts:344} first. But really, the cadence in which you drop down and pop back up is going to make an incredible difference for how\n{ts:352} long you're under load and for how long you're it takes you to do the whole set.\n\n\u2026\n\nSo like\n{ts:449} the strokes on the on the ski, the strokes on the row, the amount of lunges that we're doing, they're all right\n{ts:454} around 100 or even more. So coming into wall balls, the number of 100 shouldn't really be that daunting, but there's no\n\n\u2026\n\n{ts:476} a track, I break down my progress like I'm running on a track. So, every 10 reps, I visualize myself completing 100\n{ts:483} meters. And every rep I do after that, I'm completing some 10 m, 20 m, 50 m on the track as I'm going through each rep.\n\n\u2026\n\nAnd it's hard to do in the moment because you want to maximize that. But if it's all\n{ts:643} going to come back at the end, then it doesn't even matter what you did before. So, making sure that your pacing is on\n{ts:648} point so you can come into the wall balls with a little bit left is the best bet.",

          "snippet": "When training for wall balls in isolation, there are obviously a variety of options in terms of sets, reps, and weight of ball you could use. Periodisation and progression in your training is important. An example session might be to do 5 sets of 20 reps with the heaviest ball you can manage that for (unbroken each set), with a 2-minute rest between each set. This can then progress over time (perhaps in terms of rep, sets, or less rest) over time.\n\n\u2026\n\nAs you get closer to the event itself, it can be worth having some sessions where you try to work out how you want to break down the reps for the race itself (if you\u2019re unable to do them completely unbroken \u2013 which applies to most people). Many people make the mistake of doing as many as they can at the start, but end up needing to take a lot of rest between sets after that initial blast (which eats into their finishing time).\nInstead, more frequent, but very quick rests, may help your overall time. For example, if you can complete 40 reps unbroken from the start, but that leaves you exhausted and unable to complete the remaining 35 / 60 reps (depending on your category), you should have paced yourself a bit better. 15 reps each set with a short rest in between might be a better strategy.",

          "snippet": "From a technical standpoint the farmer carry is a relatively straightforward exercise to execute.\n\nA few key notes to keep in mind when performing the movement are:\n\nDuring a HYROX race\n\n**you\u2019ll be probably looking to get this station over as quickly as possible.**\n\nAnd with such a long distance to cover\n\n**it can be tempting to just try to hold onto the KBs as long as possible** to cover a big chunk in one go.\n\n\u2026\n\n**This is why we recommend a different strategy.**\n\n**The most successful approach to the farmer carry station** we have found with our athlete is the \u201cshort but quick\u201d approach.\n\nThis basically\n**consists of breaking sooner than you plan, usually we say 10-20m before you think you\u2019ll reach failure**. This allows you to avoid excessive lactate build up and help keep those breaks short. Overall the goal is to aim to break up the distance a little more frequently than what your max capacity would allow but ensure that those breaks are very quick. With this strategy you\u2019re guaranteed to achieve your shortest time possible for completion.\nAnother thing to watch out for is\n\n**how you approach gripping the handles through the station.** Our best recommendation is to **start with a very \u201cdeep\u201d grip**. This is also what is called a false grip, where the handle is effectively sitting more in your palms than in your actual fingers. It is more taxing for the wrist and forearm muscles but spares your fingers strength which is usually the limiting factor.\nAs you go on with your set you\u2019ll feel your false grip gradually giving out and you\u2019ll naturally transition to neutral grip relying more on your finger and hand endurance.\n\nThis transition will buy you several more meters of carry each set and it\u2019s important to capitalize on it especially during race day with such a long distance to cover.\n\n\u2026\n\nCurious how to train these two important race day tips? In the next section we\u2019ll go over how to approach your race prep training to maximize results.\n\nRecommended exercises and implements to build grip strength and endurance\n\nAs you get closer to the race it\u2019s time to become more specific with your training, transitioning from strength and endurance to mainly endurance. Additionally it will become important to test yourself by practicing the carries while under fatigue and mixed with other movements you\u2019ll be performing on race day.\n\n\u2026\n\nBecause of this, and the lower intensity of the movement, they can be utilized as a recovery break that comes at an optimal time being the sixth station you\u2019ll encounter.\n\nBut to capitalize on this \u201cbreak\u201d you\u2019ll need to have trained your grip strength endurance enough and worked on core capacity so that you can make your way through the prescribed distance without taxing other muscles too much and allowing your heart rate to come down.",

          "snippet": "### Starting Behind the Line\n\nWhen beginning your lunges, ensure that your first lunge starts\n\n**behind the starting line**. Throughout the station, alternate legs (left, right, left, right) and ensure that your **knee touches the ground** with each step.\n\nYou\u2019ll likely need to complete 3-4 lengths, and each lunge must finish with a full stand\u2014\n\n**straightening at the knee and hip** between each repetition.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Optimal Sandbag Lunge Technique\n\nFortunately, the previous station was farmers carry, so you\u2019re legs feel as fried like in other parts of the race.\n\nTo be efficient and minimize energy waste during Sandbag Lunges, focus on these key technique points.\n\n### 1. Maintain a Stacked Position\n\nThe key to efficient lunging is keeping your\n\n**trailing knee** (the one behind you) directly **underneath your hips**. This keeps your body in a stacked position and allows the sandbag to stay close to your centre of gravity, reducing strain on your lower back and legs.\n\n### 2. Distribute Weight Evenly\n\nEnsure that both your\n\n**front and back legs** are sharing the load. You want an equal amount of stress through your quads, hamstrings, and glutes, allowing the movement to be more efficient. Avoid leaning too far forward, which places unnecessary strain on your lower back.\n\n\u2026\n\n### 4. Relax Your Arms\n\nOnce the sandbag is secure on your shoulders, try to\n\n**relax your arms** as much as possible. Allow the sandbag to sit naturally on your shoulders.\n\nYou should be so relaxed that you can let go of one of the handles and let your arm drop by your side. This helps you conserve energy in your shoulders, saving it for later stages of the race.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Final Tips for Sandbag Lunge Success\n\n**Pace Yourself**: Sandbag Lunges come late in the race, so pace yourself carefully. Avoid starting too fast and burning out early. **Practice Transitions**: If you\u2019re in the doubles division, practice smooth, efficient transitions with your partner. Time your switches to avoid penalties. **Train Leg Endurance**: Since you cannot put the sandbag down without penalty, make sure your leg endurance is up to par so you can complete the station without dropping the bag.",

In fact, shorter, consistent sessions often lead to better progress.\n\nHere\u2019s how to manage volume intelligently:\n\nTrack your weekly wall ball reps (e.g., 250\u2013400 total reps/week)\n\nUse short sets (10\u201315 reps) with structured rest\nIncrease weekly volume by 10\u201315% every 1\u20132 weeks\n\n**Sample progression:**\n\nWeek 1: 200 total reps\n\nWeek 2: 225 reps\n\nWeek 3: 250 reps\n\nWeek 4: 200 reps (deload)\n\nStick to manageable numbers to avoid overtraining and burnout.\n\n### Wall Ball Density: Maximize Results Without Mental Fatigue\n\nWall ball density refers to how compact your sets are within a workout. Managing density keeps you mentally fresh and physically sharp.\n\nInstead of going 50+ reps unbroken, break your work into digestible chunks:\n\n5x15 wall balls (rest 30\u201360 sec)\n\n4 rounds of 20 wall balls with 200m run between\n\nEMOM-style workouts: 12 wall balls every minute for 6 minutes\n\nThese formats allow you to accumulate reps while training breathing, posture, and rhythm under fatigue.\n\n\u2026\n\n### How to Improve Wall Ball Technique\n\nGreat wall ball performance starts with efficient movement mechanics. Focus on:\n\nVertical torso on the squat\n\nExplosive upward drive from the legs\n\nKeeping arms relaxed during descent\n\nConsistent breathing (inhale on descent, exhale on throw)\n\nMinimal pause at the bottom\u2014rhythm is everything\n\nRecord your sets occasionally to assess posture, throw height, and speed. Small tweaks can yield big efficiency gains over time.\n\n\u2026\n\n**Day 2: Density Builder (race weight)**\n\n5 rounds:\n\n15 wall balls\n\n20/15 cal ski\n\n10 wall balls\n\n250m run\n\nRest 1 minute between rounds\n\n**Day 3 (optional): Race Simulation**\n\nAfter a longer session:\n\n50 wall balls for time\n\nRest 3 minutes\n\n25 wall balls\n\nTrack total reps each week and scale intensity as needed.",

Begin with high volume air squats sets until you can complete 100 unbroken at a sustainable pace.\n \nThis drills builds speed, endurance and fatigue tolerance over time, through the bottom phase of the movement.\n \nSecondly Tip No 2, is to drill and train weighted max rep goblet squats with 30 to 60 second rests between sets.

          "snippet": "Sandbag Lunges is the seventh station in a HYROX event. You need to complete 100m of lunges in total.\n\nYou will have already run 7km and have completed 6 functional stations (SkiErg, sled push, sled pull, burpee broad jumps, rowing and farmers carries). Following the sandbag lunges, you will have a 1km run and the wall balls station left to complete.\n\nThe sandbag lunges primarily target the glutes and thighs. At this late stage in the race, they can feel particularly brutal (as can running 1km straight afterwards!).\n\nThe sandbags used for the lunges in HYROX are produced by Centr.\n\nBelow is a video from HYROX outlining the exercise\u2026\n\n**HYROX Sandbag Lunges Requirements ( weights and distance)**\n\nThe sandbag lunges requirements, by category, in HYROX are as follows:\n\nWomen: 100m with a 10kg sandbag\n\nWomen Pro: 100m with a 20kg sandbag\n\nMen: 100m with a 20kg sandbag\n\nMen Pro: 100m with a 30kg sandbag\n\nMixed Doubles: 100m with a 20kg sandbag\n\nWomen Doubles: 100m with a 10kg sandbag\n\nMen Doubles: 100m with a 20kg sandbag\n\nWomen Relay: 100m with a 10kg sandbag\n\nMen Relay: 100m with a 20kg sandbag\n\nMixed Relay: Female members 100m with a 10kg sandbag / Male members 100m with a 20kg sandbag\n\n**HYROX Sandbag Lunges Standards**\n\nDuring each lunge, the rear knee MUST touch the ground and lunges must be carried out using alternate knees. You cannot take any steps in between repetitions; however, you may stop after each lunge with both feet on the ground if you prefer this to continuous lunges.\n\nAny violations will receive a warning, and a second warning will result in a 5 second penalty.\n\nThe athlete\u2019s foot must completely cross all white lines, including the turning points and finishing line.\n\nThe sandbag MUST always remain on both shoulders. If you put the sandbag down, you will incur a 5 second penalty. If you put the sandbag down a second time, you will be disqualified. This is worth appreciating; while the exercise is obviously extremely tough on the legs, it can also be quite tough on the arms / elbows, as its quite a lot of weight to be carrying for a period of time.\n\n**Doubles** \u2013 The resting partner walks behind the working partner. If the walking partner obstructs other participants, the team will be issued with a 10m distance penalty.\n\nFor more information on the rules around the lunges, you can check the HYROX rulebook for your division.\n\n**Training for the HYROX Sandbag Lunges**\n\nSandbag lunges are one of the most misunderstood stations in HYROX. They aren\u2019t especially technical, but they demand a mix of leg strength, aerobic fitness, joint tolerance, pacing, and the ability to keep moving under fatigue (which can be high this late into the race).\n\nTraining them appropriately is important but also a balancing act. Too little work and it costs you significant time and energy in the race, but too much (or incorrect) work and it can wreck recovery and lead to joint issues. The best approach is steady, progressive exposure with the right supporting work around it.\n\n### Nail the Movement Standard Early\n\nA lot of fatigue in the lunges during HYROX comes from inefficient reps (not to mention potential lost time from time penalties if applied) Key cues include ensuring back knee touches the floor every rep, you don\u2019t drop the bag at all (which can require grip strength), your front foot stays planted / stable, and you stay tall through the torso (don\u2019t fold forward). Efficiency may feel unimportant for a simple lunge, but over 100m it adds up.\n\n### Progress Volume Gradually\n\nHYROX lunges are mostly a muscular endurance problem (as opposed to an issue of pure strength). You need to be able to repeat quality steps for a long time without your legs shutting down. Rather than jumping straight into full race-distance sets, build volume over weeks. Overdoing it can lead to injury risk but also can have an impact on the rest of your training \u2013 too many lunges one day, for example, might impact your ability to run the next).\n\n### Race Specificity\n\nFresh lunges and HYROX lunges are two completely different things. They come late, after sleds, carries, and plenty of running. Therefore, some practice of lunging when in a fatigued state will be important so it\u2019s not a huge shock on race day.\n\nIt\u2019s also likely worth mentioning at this point that you still need to run 1km AFTER completing the lunges. So, practice in training, during certain sessions, moving from running into lunges and back into running.\n\nRegarding fatigue, remember that pacing your race up to the lunges will be an important factor in your lunge performance, as will overall aerobic fitness. If you arrive at the lunge station too cooked, your lunge performance will be impacted regardless of how strong or how much muscular endurance you have. Solid aerobic work (Zone 2, threshold running, compromised intervals) supports better lunges more than many people realise.\n\n### Train the Upper Body Position\n\nPeople often think lunges are \u201clegs only,\u201d but posture can be a factor too. If your trunk collapses under the sandbag, every step costs more. Therefore, useful accessories include front rack holds, Zercher carries, and heavy goblet holds while walking.\n\nYou also need to grip on to the sandbag for the duration of the station. Therefore, exercises such as farmers carries can actually carry over to help you to some extent here.\n\n### Build Joint Tolerance\n\nLunges load the knees, hips, and ankles through a long range of motion. If you don\u2019t have good tolerance here, the movement can feel brutal and difficult to recover from.\n\nIncluding a small amount of knee-friendly prep work each week can make a big difference:\n\n- Deep range split squats or controlled lunges\n\n- Heel-elevated squat patterns\n\n- Step-up variations to strengthen the knee through range\n\nAdditionally, isometric work can be beneficial an underrated tool for lunges. Consider wall sits, holds in the bottom lunge position under load, and short\n\n__hard__ pushes against an immovable object (3 to 5 seconds).\n\n### Potential Weekly Structure\n\nA realistic approach might look like:\n\n- 1 strength session with split squat work + isometrics\n\n- 1 muscular endurance lunge session (progressive volume)\n\n- Occasional compromised lunges inside HYROX-specific workouts\n\nThat can be enough to build confidence and consistency without destroying your legs every week, but obviously every person is different and you\u2019ll need to assess how you feel, perform and recover to come up with an appropriate level for you.

          "snippet": "### Fix #1: Stop Pushing from Too High\n\n**\u274c MISTAKE:** Upright torso, arms extended high, pushing down into the sled instead of forward.\n\n**\u2705 FIX:** Hips below shoulders, 45-degree body angle, weight driving forward not down.\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf WHY IT WORKS:** Lower position creates horizontal force vector. When you stand too tall, gravity works against you\u2014you're pushing down into the carpet, creating more friction. A 45-degree lean channels your power horizontally, moving the sled forward with less resistance.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Fix #2: Bent Arms, Not Straight Arms\n\n**\u274c MISTAKE:** Locked-out arms, pushing from shoulders, treating the sled like a bench press.\n\n**\u2705 FIX:** Elbows bent 90-120 degrees. Arms act as connectors, not pushers. Your legs do the work.\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf WHY IT WORKS:** Your legs generate 4x more power than your shoulders. Straight arms force your delts and triceps to engage heavily\u2014they fatigue fast. Bent arms simply transmit leg power to the sled. You're a conduit, not the engine.\n**\ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f DRILL: Phantom Push**\n\nPush the sled with your hands at your sides (no contact with sled). You'll immediately feel your legs taking over. Now add your arms back\u2014keep that same leg-dominant feeling. Your arms should feel almost passive.\n\nResearch on sled push biomechanics and force production shows straight arms increase shoulder fatigue by 15-20% compared to bent arms\u2014and shoulders are your limiting factor, not your legs.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Your Pre-Push Setup Checklist\n\nPrint this checklist and bring it to your next training session. Run through it before every sled push until it's automatic.\n\n### Before You Touch the Sled\n\n\n\n**Shoes tied tight**(flat sole preferred\u2014CrossFit/wrestling shoes if available)\n\n\n\n**Chalk on hands**if allowed (grip security)\n\n\n\n**Deep breath, heart rate controlled**(don't rush to the sled)\n\n\n\n**Visualization:**Low position, bent arms, short choppy steps\n\n### Hand Position Setup\n\n\n\n**Hands shoulder-width apart**(not too narrow)\n\n\n\n**Firm grip**but not death-grip (save forearm energy)\n\n\n\n**Arms bent 90-120 degrees**(elbows in, ready to transmit power)\n\n### Body Position Check\n\n\n\n**Hips below shoulders**(45-degree torso lean\u2014this is critical)\n\n\n\n**Weight on midfoot**ready to drive through heels\n\n\n\n**Core braced hard**(360-degree tension)\n\n\n\n**Glutes engaged**before first step\n\n\n\n**Head neutral**eyes 6 feet ahead on ground",

          "snippet": "**The push off:** as we\u2019ve previously mentioned perhaps **the hardest part of the sled push is getting the sled to start moving in the first place**. No matter your chosen technique, we always recommend a two-foot push off.\n\nYou will want to maximize your weight through momentum, so plant your feet steadily and then let yourself \u201cfall forward\u201d against the sled.\nCouple that first bout of momentum with a strong push from both legs once you\u2019ve made contact with the sled. Once your body is fully extended against the sled, start with your strides.\n\n**THE TECHNIQUES**\n\nThere are three commonly used variations of the sled push that you should know about and train to find the perfect fit for you.\nWe\u2019d argue this is the variation most favored by rookies and especially men. Hands are usually place in the upper third of the sled poles. You will be pushing the sled from a \u201cfront rack\u201d position where you arms are fully bent and your shoulders are one the same plane of your hands and the sled poles BUT are NOT making contact with either.\n**This variation is very taxing on the shoulders** so depending on your height, levers and strength biases may not be the best variation of the three.\n\nHowever it does have its place among the options to train especially for men as they do have more relative height to the sled as well as upper body strength.\n\nGreat option if you are on the shorter side, want to save your upper body \u201cjuice\u201d for later on in the race pr just don\u2019t have the shoulder strength yet to maintain that front rack hold while pushing the sled.\n**We call it full lock out as you will have your arms fully extended**, elbow possibly locked out if you are comfortable with it, and we also recommend pushing some extension in your upper back to create a more stacked position that will tire you out less as you move the sled.\n\nHands should go in the middle section of the sled poles to avoid creating odd angles of force that might make it feel heavier.\nWhen completing the first step of the sled push and utilizing the full lockout technique, make sure to immediately start with your arms already locked out as pressing the sled with your arms will tire them out for nothing.\n\nYou might have seen this technique\n\n**used by pro athletes, especially men who weigh enough** to use their body \u201cagainst\u201d the sled.\nThe athlete will place their hands towards the end of the sled poles, fingers facing down, and then \u201cwrap their arms\u201d around the poles, letting their shoulders physically rest against the top of the poles.\n\nThis technique can be \u201cpassive\u201d, allowing the upper body to rest.\n\nOr more \u201cactive\u201d with the athlete almost actively pulling onto the sled poles in order to pull up his side of the sled and take away some of the weight-bearing down on the floor.",

Skip to here if you're lazy\n08:37 Setting the lever to 10 is nonsense.\n\n\u2026\n\n{ts:20} probably not training hard enough [Music] it all comes down to rule 5.5\n{ts:29} the damper setting on the ergo meter is preset for the following resistance women five women pro and men six men pro\n{ts:40} seven now i'll sidestep my usual rant about the fact it's not about resistance\n\n\u2026\n\n{ts:138} than you're used to in your training now the issue is airflow and the culprit is dirt the lever on the side of the\n{ts:145} machine isn't a vulgar resistance like you'd find on a spin bike it controls airflow that the fan inside fights\n{ts:154} against a higher number on the lever means more air gets in which makes each stroke feel\n{ts:161} heavier lower the lever and less air gets in making the stroke feel lighter but\n{ts:168} dirt can clog up the air intake that the lever controls and worse the mesh surrounding the fan cage can fill up\n{ts:176} with dirt and dust adding to the problem on the race floor assuming they are all well maintained machines setting the\n{ts:184} lever to a preset like 7 isn't too much of an issue as they'll all let in a similar amount of air however if the\n{ts:192} concept 2 in your gym hasn't been cleaned in a while it may let in a lot less air at the same lever setting\n{ts:200} because of the accumulation of dirt and dust less air in means less air to fight\n{ts:206} against and the stroke will feel a lot lighter on a dirty machine compared to a clean machine even when both are set to\n{ts:215} the same lever setting so what do you do it's simple you just need to set up the machine that you\n{ts:222} train on to feel like the one that you'll race on and you do this by using something called drag factor\n{ts:229} now the gubbins inside the monitor on the concept too knows how much air the fan is fighting against and gives it a\n{ts:237} number known as drag factor and this drag factor has two purposes the first is what we're interested in by\n{ts:245} setting the drag factor on your training machine to a similar value that you'll find on the machine on the race floor\n{ts:251} you'll make them both feel the same and you'll be training properly but the monitor also uses this drag factor to\n{ts:259} calculate how fast you're rowing combining it with the amount of power you're putting in to give you your pace\n{ts:267} and this is why it's still a fair race with one machine set to lever 10 and another\n{ts:273} on lever one it's like two people running up the same flight of stairs side by side\n{ts:280} one takes three steps at a time that's the high drag factor the other only takes one step at a time low lever\n{ts:288} setting low drag factor they both climb the same stairs it's just how they do it that's different one takes long powerful\n\n\u2026\n\n{ts:319} rates keeping the flywheel turning and if you've been training to climb stairs one step at a time but then you're told\n{ts:326} in a race that you have to climb three at a time the difference in feel will be large because you won't be prepared for\n{ts:333} it so if you're training on a concept too that doesn't let in as much air as it should when you sit on that machine\n\n\u2026\n\n{ts:404} factor and then row a few strokes the monitor will tell you what your machine's drag factor is and then you\n{ts:411} can change the drag factor by moving the lever and adjusting the airflow if you're a woman with a preset lever\n{ts:418} setting of 5 then set your drag factor to round about 130 135 if you are a pro woman or a man with a\n{ts:427} preset lever setting of 6 then set your drag factor to round about 145 and if you're a pro man with a preset\n{ts:437} lever setting of seven then set the drag factor on your training machine to round about 165\n{ts:444} these numbers won't be identical to the machine that you'll find on the race floor but it will be close enough that\n\n\u2026\n\n{ts:508} well i should slow down use drag factor instead of the lever to make sure you're training how you'll\n{ts:514} race i promise you it'll help oh the difference in airflow caused by dirt is also why saying i train on 5 or worse i\n{ts:523} train on 10 means nothing depending on how dirty the machine is the lever at 10 on your machine may actually feel a lot",

points in HYROX performance.\n\n## How to Interpret Your HYROX Time\n\nUse these benchmarks to guide your training and goal setting:\n\n**Sub-90 minutes \u2192 above average globally** **Sub-75 minutes \u2192 highly competitive performance** **Sub-60 minutes \u2192 elite international level** **100+ minutes \u2192 common first-race range**\n\nMost first-time competitors finish between\n\n**90 and 120 minutes**, depending on pacing strategy, strength endurance, and race experience.\n\n## How Reliable Are These Benchmarks?\n\nHYROX is one of the few fitness race formats that is fully standardised worldwide. Every event uses:\n\n- identical race structure\n\n- chip timing\n\n- centralised results tracking\n\n- global competition data\n\nThis allows performance comparisons across countries, seasons, and divisions.\n\nBenchmark ranges are informed by:\n\n- Official HYROX competition information and participant averages\n\n- Large international result pools recorded every race season\n\n- Independent statistical analysis of large performance datasets, including studies examining thousands to hundreds of thousands of finish times\n\nThat scale of data makes HYROX performance benchmarks unusually reliable compared to most fitness events.\n\n### HYROX Finish Time Distribution Curve (Percentiles Visualised)\n\nMost HYROX finish times cluster in the middle of the field, with fewer athletes at the very fast (elite) and very slow (beginner) ends. This bell-curve style chart helps you instantly understand where your time likely sits in the overall distribution.\n\n**How to use this:** Find your finish time on the bottom axis, then match it to the coloured band.\n\nThe middle bands represent the biggest share of athletes, while the far-left (Elite) is rare.\n\n#### Enter Your HYROX Time \u2192 Get Your Performance Band\n\n**1:32:30**, enter\n\n**92.5**.\n\n## Average HYROX Times 2026\n\nCompare your own times to the average times set in each division so far in 2026.\n\n### HYROX Average Station Times (Pro vs Open) + Average Finish Time\n\n|Station|HYROX Pro Men|HYROX Pro Women|HYROX Open Men|HYROX Open Women|\n|--|--|--|--|--|\n|SkiErg|04:11|04:48|04:30|05:10|\n|Sled Push|03:40|03:43|03:00|02:45|\n|Sled Pull|05:54|06:05|05:07|05:50|\n|Burpees|04:35|05:22|05:45|07:09|\n|Row|04:29|05:02|04:51|05:24|\n|Farmers Carry|02:02|02:35|02:10|02:16|\n|Lunges|05:08|05:21|05:30|05:26|\n|Wall Balls|06:48|06:41|07:33|07:18|\n|RoxZone Time|05:47|06:42|07:16|08:03|\n|Run Total|35:44|40:36|42:00|48:00|\n|Total Time|1:18:12|1:26:52|1:28:30|1:38:30|\n### HYROX Doubles Average Station Times (Men, Women & Mixed) + Average Finish Time\n\n|Station|HYROX Doubles Men|HYROX Doubles Women|HYROX Doubles Mixed|\n|--|--|--|--|\n|SkiErg|04:00|04:39|04:15|\n|Sled Push|01:47|01:51|02:08|\n|Sled Pull|03:24|04:09|04:03|\n|Burpees|03:16|04:24|03:40|\n|Row|04:28|05:05|04:43|\n|Farmers Carry|01:38|01:52|01:47|\n|Lunges|03:34|03:44|04:07|\n|Wall Balls|04:32|04:32|04:52|\n|RoxZone Time|06:37|07:34|07:09|\n|Run Total|41:14|48:18|45:19|\n|Total Time|1:14:18|1:25:59|1:21:54|\n### HYROX Relay Average Station Times (Men, Women & Mixed Relay) + Average Finish Time\n\n|Station|HYROX Relay Men|HYROX Relay Women|HYROX Mixed Relay|\n|--|--|--|--|\n|SkiErg|06:03|05:22|05:48|\n|Sled Push|02:44|02:32|02:17|\n|Sled Pull|04:54|05:55|04:42|\n|Burpees|04:58|06:10|05:01|\n|Row|04:45|05:18|04:58|\n|Farmers Carry|02:07|02:06|02:02|\n|Lunges|05:00|05:00|04:37|\n|Wall Balls|06:38|05:43|05:42|\n|RoxZone Time|06:38|05:43|05:42|\n|Run Total|35:44|38:13|34:11|\n|Total Time|1:23:06|1:30:50|1:21:33|\n## Understanding HYROX Times\n\nIn every HYROX event, you are equipped with a timing chip that\u2019s worn around your ankle. This chip records your time throughout the competition, and makes sure your performance metrics are accurately captured.\n\nThis information is uploaded to the HYROX ranking page and broken down into the exercise stations and time you took to complete each stage and displayed on the HYROX results page like the image below. You can select elements to narrow down your search such as your division (Pro, Individual, Doubles or Relay), Gender, Age, and Country.\n\nThe timings are displayed in the order that you complete each section in a HYROX as per below;\n\n- 1km Run,\n\n- 1000m Ski Erg,\n\n- 1km Run,\n\n- 4 x 12.5m Sled Push,\n\n- 1km Run,\n\n- 4 x 12.5m Sled Pull,\n\n- 1km Run,\n\n- 80m Burpee Broad Jump,\n\n- 1km Run,\n\n- 1000m Row\n\n- 1km Run,\n\n- 200m Kettlebells Farmers Carry,\n\n- 1km Run,\n\n- 100m Sandbag Lunges,\n\n- 1km Run,\n\n- 100 Wall Balls\n\n**HYROX Rankings Explained**\n\nThe displayed data, taken from the timing chip, includes a breakdown of how you did across the race\u2019s different segments. It allows you to see the duration it took you to complete each part of the event, as well as how your performance ranked against other people globally within your division.\n\nThis feature is great for assessing your performance, identifying areas of strength, and pinpointing the bits you need to focus on and do better in.\n\n## HYROX World Record Breakers\n\n### HYROX Fastest Man World Record\n\n** \u2013 Hamburg 2025Roncevic, Alexander**\n\n00:53:15\n\n### HYROX fastest Woman World Record\n\n**Lauren Weeks** \u2013 Glasgow 2025\n\n00:56.23\n\n### HYROX Fastest Men Pro Doubles World Record\n\n**Rich Ryan, Pelayo Menendez-Fernendez** \u2013 Miami 2025\n\n00:48.31\n\n### HYROX Fastest Men Doubles World Record\n\n**Jake Williamson and Fabi Eisenlauer** \u2013 Berlin 2025\n\n00:47:57\n\n### HYROX Fastest Women Pro Doubles World Record\n\n**Lauren Weeks and Vivian Tafuto** \u2013 Vancouver 2025\n\n00:53.40\n\n### HYROX Fastest Women Doubles World Record\n\n**Meg Martin & Mollie Emond** \u2013 Brisbane 2025\n\n00:54:20\n\n### HYROX Fastest Mixed Doubles World Record\n\n**Cole Learn and Mollie Fkiaras** \u2013 Melbourne 2025\n\n00:49:13\n\n### HYROX Fastest Men Relay World Record\n\n**J\u00f8rgen Olsen, Simen R\u00f8ssland, Kevin Woods, and Kieron White** \u2013 London 2025\n\n00:45:43\n\n### HYROX Fastest Women Relay World Record\n\n**Alexandra Hill, Lauren Stockley, Saskia Geddes, and Allana Falcone**r \u2013 London 2025\n\n00:51:26\n\n### HYROX Fastest Mixed Relay World Record\n\n**Tim Wenisch, Sin\u00e9ad Bent, Charlie Botterill, and Seka Arning** \u2013 Manchester 2026\n\n00:47:12\n\n## Top 10 HYROX Records\n\n### Top 10 HYROX Men Times\n\n### Top 10 HYROX Women Times\n\n### Top 10 HYROX Men Pro Doubles\n\n### Top 10 HYROX Men Doubles Open\n\n### Top 10 HYROX Pro Womens Doubles\n\n### Top 10 HYROX Womens Doubles\n\n### Top 10 HYROX Men Team Relay\n\n### Top 10 HYROX Women Team Relay\n\n### Top 10 HYROX Mixed Team Relay\n\n## Setting Realistic Expectations\n\nIf you\u2019re just starting out, it\u2019s important to you have realistic expectations about your HYROX times. Your finishing time in a HYROX race is influenced by a ton of factors, ranging from your current fitness level, experience in similar events, race day nerves, sleep, nutrition etc, the list goes on. Just finishing your first race can be something to be proud of.\n\n**Fitness Level**\n\nYour physical conditioning plays a huge role in how you tackle the HYROX stations. The more practise your body has in the movements each station requires, the quicker and more efficiently you\u2019ll complete each station.\n\n**Experience**\n\nThere\u2019s no substitute for experience. Veterans of HYROX events, and those with a background in similar endurance and functional fitness competitions, will have a strategic edge.\n\nThey understand how to pace themselves, when to push hard, and how to conserve energy for the later stages of the race.\n\nIf you\u2019re new to HYROX, your initial times will reflect your learning curve, learn to listen to your body and when to ease off or ramp up your effort without burning out.\n\nWhile it\u2019s natural to look up to the crazy course records of Hunter Mcintyre and Lauren Weeks and the unbelievable times they set, it\u2019s important to ground your expectations in your current reality.\n\nThese record times serve as an insight of what\u2019s possible, showcasing the pinnacle of human performance in the HYROX world. Use them to inspire and motivate you to what is possible.\n\nHowever, diving headfirst into your HYROX journey with the expectation of matching or outperforming these elite times can be a recipe for disappointment. Instead, focus on setting personal goals that challenge you yet are attainable based on your fitness level, experience, and familiarity with the course.\n\nCelebrate your own milestones and progress, no matter how little they can seem, compared to the top athletes and make sure you have the right footwear to get you through.\n\nAs you grow in HYROX, gradually increase your performance bar. Over time, with consistent training and experience, you\u2019re gonna surprise yourself with how much you can achieve. Let the exceptional times inspire you, but let your personal progress be your guide and source of pride.\n\n## Training Tips for HYROX\n\nTo smash your race, your HYROX training should be a blend of endurance and strength training. This will make sure you\u2019re as prepared to nail the 8 x 1km runs as you are to glide through the heavy sled push and pulls.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to follow a structured HYROX training plan, focusing equally on building your stamina and bolstering your muscle for the functional challenges.\n\nMastering the art of pacing during the running segments can make or break your race, so absorb tips on finding that sweet spot in your stride that keeps you moving efficiently from start to finish.\n\nIt\u2019s good practise to keep on top of all the ways to improve your fitness outside of HYROX.\n\n## Data Sources and Methodology\n\nPerformance benchmarks and participation patterns are based on:\n\n- Official HYROX competition information and global race timing data\n\n- Standardised international race formats used across all events\n\n- Large-scale participant result pools recorded across multiple seasons\n\n- Independent performance analysis of thousands of race results\n\nPrimary governing authority:\n\n**HYROX official competition data and event timing systems**\n\nThese benchmarks represent real-world performance outcomes across the global HYROX racing population.\n\n## Wrapping Up\n\nSo there you have it, the average times and fastest HYROX times in the world. Use these times to see where you currently sit in each area of your race and work out what sections you need to focus on the most to improve your overall performance.\n\nShaving off a few seconds here and there all adds up and before you know it you could be on the elite rankings!\n\nNow get out there, smash your training and sign up for your next race!\n\n## FAQ\u2019s\n\n### What is a good HYROX time?\n\nA good HYROX time is generally\n\n**under 90 minutes**, which places an athlete above the global average.

          "snippet": "# HYROX Rowing Strategy: How to Pace 1000m and Recover for the Second Half\n\nAfter four stations and five kilometers of running, you finally get to\n\n**sit down**. The Concept2 rower at Station 5 is both a blessing and a trap.\n\nHere's the trap: athletes see sitting and think \"recovery.\" They take it easy, row at 2:30/500m pace, and waste 5+ minutes getting nowhere. Or they do the opposite\u2014sprint at 1:40/500m pace because they finally feel okay, only to implode during the farmer's carry.\n\n**1000 meters of rowing** demands strategy. Done right, it's active recovery that doesn't cost you time. Done wrong, it's a momentum killer or an energy burner that haunts you for the final three stations.\n\nIn this guide, you'll learn how to row efficiently, pace strategically, and use Station 5 as a tactical advantage instead of a liability.\n\n## What is the Rowing Station in HYROX?\n\nThe rowing station is\n\n**Station 5** in HYROX\u2014the first station of the race's second half. After your fifth 1km run (following burpee broad jumps), you complete **1000 meters** on the Concept2 rowing machine.\n\n**Race Standards:** **Distance:**1000 meters **Machine:**Concept2 RowErg (Damper setting at athlete discretion) **Position in Race:**Station 5 (after fifth 1km run) **Average Completion Time:**3:30-5:00 (depending on fitness and pacing strategy)\n\n**Strategic Position:** The row comes at the race's midpoint when fatigue is highest. It's also the last \"seated\" station\u2014everything after requires standing and loaded movement.\n\n## Rowing Muscles Worked: The Full-Body Engine\n\nThe rowing stroke is\n\n**85% legs, 10% core, and 5% arms**. Most people get this ratio completely wrong.\n\n### Primary Muscles\n\n**Quadriceps:**Drive the initial push phase\u2014the most powerful part of the stroke. **Glutes:**Extend the hips during the drive. **Latissimus Dorsi:**Pull the handle during the finish phase. **Hamstrings:**Assist in the drive and control the recovery.\n\n### Secondary Muscles\n\n**Core (Rectus Abdominis, Obliques):**Transfers power from legs to arms and maintains posture. **Biceps:**Assist in the pulling motion. **Forearms:**Control handle grip throughout the stroke. **Calves:**Push off the foot stretchers. **Erector Spinae:**Maintains spine stability during the layback.\n\n### The Leg Drive Advantage\n\n**Key Insight:**Elite rowers generate 70% of their power from legs, not arms. In HYROX, your arms are already fatigued from SkiErg, sled pull, and burpees. **Leg drive is your advantage.**Use it.\n\n## Perfect Rowing Technique: The HYROX-Optimized Stroke\n\nRowing efficiency matters more than raw power. Here's the stroke breakdown:\n\n### The Catch (Start Position)\n\n- Shins vertical, knees bent\n\n- Arms extended, shoulders forward\n\n- Core engaged, back straight\n\n- Grip relaxed\u2014hooks, not death grip\n\n### The Drive (Power Phase)\n\n**Push with your legs first**\u2014the handle doesn't move until your legs extend\n\n- Once legs are almost straight,\n\n**lean back slightly**(to 1 o'clock position) **Pull handle to lower chest**as the final motion\n\n- Sequence: Legs \u2192 Back \u2192 Arms (always in that order)\n\n### The Finish\n\n- Legs straight\n\n- Slight layback\n\n- Handle at lower chest/upper stomach\n\n- Brief pause\u2014don't rush the recovery\n\n### The Recovery (Return to Catch)\n\n**Arms extend first** **Body rocks forward** **Legs bend last**as you slide back to the catch\n\n- Recovery should take twice as long as the drive\n\n- Sequence: Arms \u2192 Back \u2192 Legs (reverse of drive)\n\n### Stroke Rate for HYROX\n\n**Target:**24-28 strokes per minute for most athletes **Too slow (under 22):**You're leaving time on the table **Too fast (over 32):**You're probably getting sloppy and wasting energy\n\n## Common Rowing Mistakes (And How to Fix Them)\n\n### Mistake #1: Arms Before Legs\n\n**The Problem:** Pulling with your arms before your legs extend, losing power.\n\n**The Fix:** Drill it: \"Legs. Back. Arms.\" Say it out loud during training. The handle shouldn't bend until your legs are almost straight.\n\n### Mistake #2: Hunching Forward\n\n**The Problem:** Rounding your back at the catch, straining your lower back.\n\n**The Fix:** Keep your **chest proud** throughout the stroke. Engage your lats at the catch to maintain posture.\n\n### Mistake #3: Rushing the Recovery\n\n**The Problem:** Sliding back to the catch at the same speed as the drive, creating jerky strokes.\n\n**The Fix:** The recovery is **controlled rest**. Slow slide forward, explosive drive back. 2:1 ratio.\n\n### Mistake #4: Damper Setting Too High\n\n**The Problem:** Setting the damper to 10 thinking it makes you faster. It doesn't.\n\n**The Fix:** Set damper between **4-6** for most athletes. It's not a resistance machine\u2014it controls airflow. Higher settings fatigue your muscles faster without improving speed.\n\n### Mistake #5: Pulling to Your Chin\n\n**The Problem:** Finishing with the handle at neck level, straining arms and shoulders.\n\n**The Fix:** Handle finishes at **lower chest or upper stomach**. Elbows should pull straight back, not up.\n\n### Mistake #6: Death Grip on the Handle\n\n**The Problem:** Squeezing the handle like it owes you money, frying already-fatigued forearms.\n\n**The Fix:** Loose hook grip. Fingers over the handle, relaxed grip. Your back does the pulling, not your hands.\n\n## HYROX Rowing Pacing Strategy\n\nThe 1000m row is a strategic puzzle. Here's how to solve it:\n\n### Option 1: Conservative \"Recovery\" Pace\n\n**Best For:** Athletes who struggled in the first half and need to regroup.\n\n**Splits:**\n\n- 0-250m: 2:05-2:10/500m\n\n- 250-500m: 2:05-2:10/500m\n\n- 500-750m: 2:00-2:05/500m\n\n- 750-1000m: 1:55-2:00/500m\n\n**Total Time:** ~4:00-4:15\n\n**Benefit:** Lowers heart rate, catches breath, preserves legs for farmer's carry.\n\n### Option 2: Steady State \"Time Saver\" Pace\n\n**Best For:** Athletes who are racing for time and feeling okay.\n\n**Splits:**\n\n- 0-250m: 1:55-2:00/500m\n\n- 250-500m: 1:50-1:55/500m\n\n- 500-750m: 1:50-1:55/500m\n\n- 750-1000m: 1:45-1:50/500m\n\n**Total Time:** ~3:40-3:50\n\n**Benefit:** Solid time without burning out.\n\n### Option 3: Aggressive \"Send It\" Pace\n\n**Best For:** Elite athletes who can recover on the run.\n\n**Splits:**\n\n- 0-250m: 1:45-1:50/500m\n\n- 250-500m: 1:42-1:47/500m\n\n- 500-750m: 1:42-1:47/500m\n\n- 750-1000m: 1:40-1:45/500m\n\n**Total Time:** ~3:20-3:30\n\n**Benefit:** Maximum time savings, but requires fitness to recover.\n\n### The Golden Rule\n\n**Negative split your row.** Start conservative, finish fast. A 2:00 first 500m and 1:45 second 500m is better than blowing up at 1:40 and crawling to a 2:10 finish.\n\n## Rowing Alternatives for Training\n\nNot everyone has a Concept2 rower at home. Here are alternatives that build rowing fitness:\n\n### 1. Dumbbell Rows (High Rep)\n\n**Why It Works:**Builds back endurance and mimics the pulling pattern **Protocol:**4 sets of 20-25 reps each arm\n\n### 2. Resistance Band Rows\n\n**Why It Works:**Low-impact back and core work **Protocol:**100 reps for time with medium band\n\n### 3. Bent-Over Barbell Rows\n\n**Why It Works:**Develops back strength and core stability **Protocol:**3 sets of 15 at moderate weight\n\n### 4. Good Mornings\n\n**Why It Works:**Strengthens the posterior chain used in the rowing drive **Protocol:**3 sets of 12\n\n### 5. Kettlebell Swings\n\n**Why It Works:**Hip drive power that transfers to leg drive in rowing **Protocol:**5 rounds of 20 swings\n\n### 6. Bike Erg or Assault Bike\n\n**Why It Works:**Similar aerobic demand with seated position **Protocol:**3km bike for time\n\n### 7. Deadlifts + Pull-Ups (Superset)\n\n**Why It Works:**Combines the hip hinge and pulling patterns **Protocol:**5 rounds: 8 Deadlifts + 10 Pull-Ups\n\n## Rowing Training Workouts for HYROX\n\n### Workout 1: Pacing Practice\n\n- 4 x 500m Row\n\n- Rest 2 minutes between\n\n- Goal: Negative split each 500m AND the overall set\n\n### Workout 2: Race Simulation (Stations 4-6)\n\n- 1km Run\n\n- 80m Burpee Broad Jumps\n\n- 1km Run\n\n**1000m Row**\n\n- 1km Run\n\n- 200m Farmer's Carry\n\n- Track all splits\n\n### Workout 3: Endurance Builder\n\n- 3000m Row\n\n- Every 500m: Get off and do 10 push-ups\n\n- Goal: Maintain consistent split despite interruptions\n\n### Workout 4: Interval Power\n\n- 8 x 250m Row\n\n- Rest 1:00 between\n\n- Goal: Hold target split across all 8 pieces\n\n### Workout 5: Leg Drive Focus\n\n- 5 x 500m Row\n\n- Stroke rate cap: 22 SPM\n\n- Goal: Hit fast splits with slow strokes (forces leg drive efficiency)\n\n## The Strategic Advantage: Row to Recover\n\nHere's the HYROX secret: the row is the\n\n**only station where you sit down**. Smart athletes use this strategically.\n\n**What Recovery Looks Like:**\n\n- Controlled breathing returns\n\n- Heart rate drops 10-15 BPM\n\n- Legs get brief relief from impact\n\n- Mental reset before the final push\n\n**What Recovery Does NOT Look Like:**\n\n- Going so easy you waste 5+ minutes\n\n- Stopping mid-row to catch your breath\n\n- Ignoring technique and letting form fall apart\n\nThe row should feel like you're\n\n**working but sustainable**. If you can't talk in short sentences, you're going too hard. If you could read a book, you're going too easy.\n\n## Train Like You Race\n\nHere's the problem: most people train rowing fresh. They hop on the Concept2 with rested legs and pull a great 1000m time. Then race day comes, and they're rowing after burpee broad jumps with legs full of lead.\n\n**OnlyGains.ai fixes this disconnect.** The platform creates unlimited free HYROX simulations that put rowing where it belongs\u2014after stations 1-4, with accumulated fatigue. You train the row in context, not in isolation.\n\nWhen you know what 1000m feels like after 5km of running and 4 brutal stations, you can pace race day confidently. No surprises, no blow-ups, just smart execution.\n\n## Rowing Benchmarks: Where Do You Stand?\n\n|Level|1000m Time|Pace/500m|\n|--|--|--|\n|Elite|Under 3:10|Under 1:35|\n|Advanced|3:10-3:40|1:35-1:50|\n|Intermediate|3:40-4:15|1:50-2:07|\n|Beginner|4:15-5:00|2:07-2:30|\n|First-Timer|5:00+|2:30+|\n**Note:** These times are for fresh rowing. Expect 10-20% slower in a HYROX race due to fatigue.\n\n## Mental Game: The Halfway Turning Point\n\nStation 5 is psychologically critical. You're done with the hardest station (burpees), but you've still got three loaded carries and three runs ahead.\n\n**Winning the mental game:** **Celebrate the midpoint:**You're halfway done. Acknowledge the accomplishment. **Enjoy the seat:**Seriously\u2014this is the only time you get to sit. Appreciate it. **Visualize success:**During the row, picture yourself finishing strong at wall balls. **Trust your pacing:**Don't panic if you're not the fastest rower. Stick to your plan.\n\n## Final Thoughts: Row Smart, Finish Strong\n\nThe rowing station separates athletes who race strategically from those who wing it. It's not about being the fastest rower\u2014it's about using the row to set up a strong finish.\n\n**Key Takeaways:** **Legs drive the stroke**\u2014not arms **Pace conservatively**\u2014negative split your row **Use it for recovery**\u2014lower heart rate and breathe **Don't waste it**\u20145-minute rows cost you podium spots **Train in context**\u2014row fatigued, not fresh\n\nThe athletes who crush HYROX treat the row as tactical recovery. They come off the rower ready for farmer's carries, not gasping for survival.\n\n**Ready to build your race strategy?** OnlyGains.ai generates personalized HYROX training programs that teach you how to row under fatigue. Unlimited free simulations mean you can practice race pacing without guessing.\n\n",

          "snippet": "The Farmer\u2019s Carry is the sixth station in a HYROX event. You need to complete a distance of 200m with the kettlebells in your hands.\n\nWhen you reach the Farmer\u2019s Carry station, you will have already have completed 6km of running and 5 functional stations (SkiErg, sled push, sled pull, burpee broad jumps and rowing).\nFollowing this station you have 2km of running and 2 remaining functional stations (Sandbag Lunges and Wall Balls).\n\nThis exercise engages your upper back and core. Good grip strength is required.

          "snippet": "## 4. The Correct Technique to Train for HYROX Sled Pulls\n\n**Stance and Grip**\n\nStart with a stance that is slightly wider than your shoulder width, planting your feet firmly on the ground to establish a solid base. When gripping the rope, your hold should be strong but flexible.\n\nHold the rope at waist height, keeping your arms engaged but not stiff. Footwear plays a big role in maintaining stability; if you haven\u2019t found the right pair for you yet, take a look at our HYROX Trainer Review.\n\n\u2026\n\nAs you start pulling, engage your core and lower body muscles actively. Your movements should be smooth, applying a consistent force that utilises the strength of your glutes and hamstrings in harmony with your back muscles. It\u2019s a continuous, rhythmic, yet powerful motion.\n\n**The Sustained Pull**\n\nIn the sustained pulling phase, maintain a rhythmic and steady pace, coordinating your upper and lower body to generate a continuous force. It\u2019s essential to keep a strong core to support your lower back, integrating the full power of your body into the pull.\n\n\u2026\n\n**Improper Stance** Stance is everything; it\u2019s your foundation. Your stance should be firm and stable, with feet firmly planted wider than your shoulders. A narrow stance will leave you unstable and reduce your pulling power, while a too-wide stance can restrict your movement and impede your rhythm.\n\n**Erratic Pulling** Much like attempting to cook without a recipe, pulling without control can lead to disaster. Yanking the rope without a steady rhythm can cause increased fatigue and result in a less effective workout. Steady and rhythmic pulls are the key to success here.\n\n\u2026\n\n**Breath Management** Correct breath management can be your ally in sustaining energy levels and minimizing fatigue. Establish a rhythmic breathing pattern, inhaling as you prepare for the next pull and exhaling forcefully as you execute the pull.\n\n**Regular Practice to Build Endurance** Just as in any other sport, regular practice is key to enhancing your performance over time. Structure a training plan that incorporates a gradual increase in difficulty levels, including heavier sled weights and longer pull distances, to build both your strength and endurance.\n\n\u2026\n\n**Upper Back and Shoulders:** These upper body muscle groups, including the traps and deltoids, work tirelessly, offering stability to the shoulders and aiding in the pulling motion, working with the lower body to maintain a continuous force.\n\n**Grip and Forearm Engagement**\n\n**Forearms and Hands:** The forearms and hand muscles involved in grip strength are crucial in maintaining a firm hold on the ropes, ensuring a non-slip grip that facilitates a potent and sustained pulling force. Conditioning these muscles can aid in avoiding early fatigue in the arms, allowing for a steady, powerful pull throughout.\n\n\u2026\n\n**How to do a HYROX sled pull?**\n\nThe HYROX sled pull involves pulling the sled towards you using a rope while walking or running backwards. The technique requires a strong core, stable posture, and consistent pulling to maintain momentum.\n\n**What are the 8 HYROX exercises?**\n\nThe 8 HYROX exercises are:",

Which of the functional exercises do they really excel at, and which are worthy our focus over and above some of the others? Are the Elites noticeably better on run 5 than run 8, or something along those lines?\n\nSo, I started to gather some data\u2026\n\n__The Method__\n\n__The Method__\n\nI\u2019ll say upfront, I\u2019m not a mathematician. There\u2019s a chance that any mathematicians reading this will have heart palpitations at just how flawed my methodology is. Maybe I should have used means instead of medians, or greater sample sizes. Maybe I lack statistical significance.\n\nI\u2019m also not at the Elite level in HYROX.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry as I\u2019m not going to be making any conclusions or giving any specific advice. If you want specific advice for your situation, check out our coaching options. Rather I\u2019ll just make some observations and raise some questions, that will hopefully help you in your own performance, training and race planning.\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s what I\u2019ve done\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve taken, from the HYROX leaderboard, 15 of the best HYROX performances ever \u2013 for both female and male at Pro level. I\u2019ve then taken the median of their times for each run and functional station. This group I\u2019m calling \u201c\n\n**Elite**\u201d.\n\nI repeated this for a sample of athletes who achieved a time broadly similar to what HYROX have said is the average time achieved at Pro level (roughly 90mins). This group I\u2019m calling \u201c\n\n**Average**\u201d.\n\nI\u2019ve deliberately avoided including any athlete more than once. For example, Hunter McIntyre has 5 of the top 10 times ever, at the time of writing, but I\u2019ve only included the fastest of those. I\u2019ve also avoided anyone who got a time penalty to avoid skewing the data.\n\n__The Findings__\n\n__The Findings__\n\nHere were the results\u2026\n\n|Men|Women|\n|--|--|\n|Elite|Average|Difference|Elite|Average|Difference|\n|Running 1|00:03:24|00:03:44|00:00:20|00:03:38|00:04:46|00:01:08|\n|Running 2|00:03:40|00:04:43|00:01:03|00:04:07|00:05:14|00:01:07|\n|Running 3|00:03:54|00:05:37|00:01:43|00:04:22|00:05:28|00:01:06|\n|Running 4|00:03:50|00:05:37|00:01:47|00:04:24|00:05:29|00:01:05|\n|Running 5|00:03:55|00:05:33|00:01:38|00:04:28|00:05:39|00:01:11|\n|Running 6|00:03:50|00:05:21|00:01:31|00:04:22|00:05:37|00:01:15|\n|Running 7|00:03:58|00:05:32|00:01:34|00:04:23|00:05:39|00:01:16|\n|Running 8|00:04:15|00:06:19|00:02:04|00:04:43|00:06:17|00:01:34|\n|Run Total|00:30:46|00:42:26|00:11:40|00:34:27|00:44:09|00:09:42|\n|1000m SkiErg|00:03:47|00:04:17|00:00:30|00:04:12|00:04:51|00:00:39|\n|2x25m Sled Push|00:02:45|00:03:40|00:00:55|00:03:00|00:03:48|00:00:47|\n|2x25m Sled Pull|00:03:14|00:06:31|00:03:17|00:03:54|00:06:36|00:02:42|\n|80m Burpee Broad Jump|00:02:21|00:05:15|00:02:54|00:03:11|00:04:53|00:01:42|\n|1000m Row|00:03:58|00:04:35|00:00:37|00:04:29|00:05:12|00:00:43|\n|200m Farmers Carry|00:01:37|00:02:32|00:00:55|00:01:57|00:02:45|00:00:48|\n|100m Sandbag Lunges|00:03:03|00:05:22|00:02:19|00:03:35|00:05:25|00:01:50|\n|Wall Balls|00:04:25|00:07:38|00:03:13|00:03:50|00:06:20|00:02:30|\n|Roxzone Time|00:02:54|00:06:58|00:04:04|00:03:47|00:06:12|00:02:25|\n|Total|00:58:50|01:29:14|00:30:24|01:06:22|01:30:11|00:23:49|\nYou can draw your own conclusions from that data if you wish but here\u2019s some of what I thought were potentially the most useful findings\u2026\n\n__Running__\n\n__Running__\n\nRunning is a large part of HYROX (it takes up 52% of the average elite race) and, surprise surprise, the Elites are better at running than the Average. Over the 8km in a HYROX race the men are nearly 12mins quicker and women nearly 10 mins quicker. Most people will have expected this, so I won\u2019t dwell on advising you just to become a faster runner. But it is, of course, important.\n\nI do, however, think it\u2019s worth pointing out that the Elites sampled run at an average pace of 3.51mins/km (men), or 4.18mins/km (women). I feel almost embarrassed to say this as I\u2019m nowhere near the standard of these athletes, but it is a running pace that I personally can get my head around. It\n\n*feels* achievable to do that (at least if I just look at the running portion in isolation).\n\nWhen Eliud Kipchoge ran a marathon in under 2 hours, his average splits were a pace of 2.51mins per km \u2013 for the length of a marathon. That I simply can\u2019t get my head around. But the Elites running pace in HYROX I (perhaps deludedly) can.\n\nIf we look at it in the context of world records for the Marathon, Half Marathon, and half distance Ironman (where the running portion is a half marathon, after a 1.9km swim and 90km bike ride), you can see the running split times are longer in HYROX, despite it being a shorter event\u2026\n\nOf course, that may not be a completely fair comparison. They are different events, HYROX has not been going for a long time (and we may eventually see much quicker running splits), and I\u2019m comparing World Records with an average of 15 Elite HYROX competitors. But I still think it has some relevance. And what I\u2019m really trying to stress is that you can still be very good at HYROX without being one of the world\u2019s best runners \u2013 there is more than just running for you to think about.\n\n**I suspect though that the Elite HYROX athletes are world class at compromised running.** To run that pace consistently through the race, after all the functional exercises, is very impressive. I wonder if Kipchoge could do that. Or even if Kipchoge could have got to the end of the race. Maybe he\u2019d have had to bail out at the sled push?! Who knows.\n\n**To summarise from a running perspective, improving your running is likely important if you want to move yourself closer to the Elite HYROX standard. But I don\u2019t think you need to be world class at running to be world class at HYROX. You do, however, need to be very good at compromised running, and have the endurance to sustain a solid running pace over an event that lasts 54mins+. In this article we talk more about compromised running and how to train for it.**\n\n__Pacing__\n\n__Pacing__\n\nIt feels to me as if the Elites may be better at pacing themselves than the average athlete, especially on the first run. This is certainly the case if we just look at the men \u2013 women don\u2019t seem to suffer so much with this problem.\n\nYou can see that the blue line is much flatter for the Elite men, indicating their run times are more consistent across the race. The first 1km run for the Average men (orange line), in particular, is much quicker than their average splits.\n\n** What impact could this be having on the rest of their race? Should they be conserving their energy better? **\n\nThe fact that women seem to be better at pacing themselves than men is no surprise. This study showed that women were 18.33% better than men at keeping an even pace in a marathon.\n\nIs pacing even important? In an event as long as HYROX, almost certainly. The consensus seems to be that for longer events (such as HYROX) not starting out too quickly is a sensible decision. For shorter distances, a faster start (to an extent) can be ok, but as most competitors are taking 60mins+ for HYROX, it is likely you want to be holding yourself back a little on the first couple of runs.\n\n**Could this be why the Average woman is much closer in time to an Elite Woman (23mins 49secs in our data), than an Average Man is to an Elite Man (30mins 24secs)? Click here to read our article on how to appropriately pace the running at HYROX. **\n\n__Ski Pace__\n\n__Ski Pace__\n\nIt\u2019s harder to gauge but I suspect the men are going a touch too quick on the SkiErg too, relative to their overall ability. The SkiErg has the smallest difference in times between Elite and Average competitors. This might be expected. However, as we know the men are almost certainly starting out too quickly on their first run, it\u2019s quite possible this is carrying over to the Ski as well (which is the first of the functional stations).\n\nThe men are 30 seconds slower on the Ski, and women are 39 secs slower. I know personally if I go maybe 5 secs/500m slower on the SkiErg, it significantly lowers my heart rate, even though that only equates to 10 seconds slower over 1km.\n\nIf you are able, I would suggest experimenting with your ski split times in training, and see how much better you feel if you go a little slower than you\u2019re planning to for your next race. What impact does an extra, say, 10 seconds on your 1km time do for your heart rate and how you feel afterwards? 10 seconds in the context of a HYROX, is a pretty small number, and could save you a greater amount of time in the remainder of the race.\n\n__Sled Push / Sled Pull__\n\n__Sled Push / Sled Pull__\n\nThe sled-based events at HYROX are the 2 main areas that benefit from an athlete\u2019s strength. So, you might expect the difference in times between the Average and Elite to be broadly similar on both the sled push and sled pull. But it\u2019s not. Average men are 55secs slower on push, and a whopping 3.17mins slower on the pull. The women are 47secs slower on push, and 2.42mins slower on the pull.\n\nLooked at another way, Elite men spend 18% longer on sled pull than their sled push, and Elite women spend 30% longer. But the Average spend 78% (men) or 74% (women) longer on the pull than the push!\n\nAs I see it, there are a few things to think about here:\n\n\u2013 Are Average athletes pushing too hard on the sled push, relative to their strength levels? And if so, could that be screwing them up for the rest of the race?\n\n\u2013 Or are the Average just much worse at the sled pull? In which case, working on technique, pull strength and posterior chain is very important.\n\n**For most people reading this, what the Average athlete is doing doesn\u2019t really matter. But could something similar be happening in your performance? Is your sled pull to sled push ratio similar to that of an Elite athlete? If not, could you be pushing too hard on the sled pull, or neglecting the work needed to improve your sled pull times?**\n\n__Roxzone__\n\n__Roxzone__\n\nAs hesitant as I\u2019ve been to give advice in this article, I will now break that and say one thing; If you want a good time, don\u2019t f*** about in the Roxzone!\n\nThe difference between the Elites and Averages in time spent in the Roxzone is quite startling. Average men spend 4.04mins longer in there, and Average women 2mins 25secs. That seems far too long.\n\nThe size of the Roxzone does vary by venue but I would roughly estimate it to be 800m on average. Therefore, it\u2019s a reasonable expectation for your Roxzone time to broadly be 80% of your average 1km split times. For Elites the data shows 75% (men) and 88% (Women). But for Average athletes it is 131% (men) and 112% (women)!\n\nThe Roxzone was certainly a bigger area than I\u2019d been expecting prior to my first event. Personally speaking, I suspect I subconsciously started to relax a little after each run as soon as I entered the Roxzone. It wasn\u2019t a conscious thing, but my Roxzone time of 6 minutes in my first race suggests that it was happening. That is something that the Elites never do. They stop running as soon as they are about to start the next exercise. And as soon as they\u2019ve finished it, they start again. Roxzone or running track are treated the same; for running on.\n\nOne enticing thing about the Roxzone is the drinks provided there. In a hot HYROX race it becomes very tempting to stop at the water table and sip on a cool drink before setting off again. The Elites may grab a water on the way past, but I doubt they are stopping for a relaxing beverage and a chat.\n\nTo be fair, as the Elites complete the race in a faster time, they have less need to take on as much water, so that may be a factor here, but it can\u2019t explain the difference entirely.\n\n**If you\u2019ve entered a HYROX in the past, have you spent too long in the Roxzone? How could you speed that up? Does the time you spent in the zone reasonably compare to how quickly you might run 800m(ish)? **\n\nGoing forward, I plan to think of the Roxzone as just another functional exercise but one I want to win. Rather than relax as I enter the Roxzone, its game on. In fact, as I write this, I\u2019m wondering if in I\u2019ll have a game of \u201cfloor is lava\u201d with myself where I imagine the floor in the Roxzone is lava and I have to get out of there as quickly as I can. Of course, it may mean I end up doing the runs or functional stations slower, but it\u2019s worth a go!\n\n__Summary__\n\n__Summary__\n\nThe data I\u2019ve gathered does show that Elites are better than the Average at\n\n__all__ the stations, and __all __the runs. That\u2019s probably to be expected. All areas are important in improving your times.\n\nAside from what\u2019s already been mentioned above, there is a particularly large difference in times on the Wall Balls and Burpee Broad Jumps, meaning these should likely be prioritised, for most people, over and above working on SkiErg and Rowing, for example (where the differences are much smaller).\n\nIt will obviously be different for each person, as we all have our own strengths and weaknesses, but to summarise where I think some of the\n\n*lowest hanging fruit* is in bringing an Average athlete closer to Elite level it would be:\n\n\u2013 Working on compromised running\n\n\u2013 Improved pacing (men especially)\n\n\u2013 Improved performance on the sled pull (with an aim to get your sled pull to sled push ratio more closely aligned with that of the Elites)\n\n\u2013 Reduced time in the Roxzone (bringing your Roxzone time to somewhere around 75-90% of your average 1km running time across the event)\n\nIf you\u2019d like any help with your performances in HYROX, we can\u2019t promise to make you Elite but we\u2019ll do our best to maximise your potential.

James Hall)\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever stepped into a HYROX race and thought,\n\n*\u201cWhy does the SkiErg feel so easy in training but so evil on race day?\u201d* \u2014 you\u2019re not alone.\n\nThe ERGs are small pieces of the overall time, but they have an outsized impact on your\n\n**heart rate, fatigue, and ability to actually run well between stations**. And if your damper settings or stroke rates are even a little off? Yeah\u2026 they\u2019ll let you know.\n\nIn our latest episode of the\n\n**RMR Training Podcast**, we sat down with world-record erg machine **James Hall** to break down everything HYROX athletes get wrong about the SkiErg and RowErg \u2014 and how to finally fix it.\n\nThis is your full guide. Save it, share it with your training partner, and let\u2019s get you more efficient, faster, and calmer on race day.\n\n## Why ERG Strategy Matters More Than You Think\n\nMost HYROX athletes fall into one of two camps:\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3\n\n**Try to smash the ERGs like they're sprint tests**\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3\n\n**Go so easy they lose free time out of fear of blowing up**\n\nJames offers a better path:\n\nUse the ERGs as\n\n**controlled, efficient engines** \u2014 not hero moments, not rest breaks.\n\nWhen you get them right, you:\n\nKeep your heart rate under control\n\nSave your legs for the sleds and runs\n\nStay mentally composed in the chaos\n\nPick up free time without burning matches\n\nERG discipline isn\u2019t sexy, but it wins races.\n\n## The SkiErg: Stroke Rate, Damper, and the \u201cGreen Zone\u201d You Keep Missing\n\nLet\u2019s start with the big one:\n\n**slow, heavy, powerful strokes do NOT automatically mean \u201cmore efficient.\u201d**\n\nYou've seen the videos:\n\n30 strokes per minute vs 60 strokes per minute \u2014 same pace.\n\nThe internet loves to say low SPM is better.\n\nJames says\u2026\n\n*not really.* **The Truth About Stroke Rate** **30 SPM**\u2192 too heavy, too long, too much muscular fatigue **60 SPM**\u2192 too frantic, too cardiovascularly expensive **40\u201348 SPM**\u2192 the sweet spot for most HYROX athletes\n\nEnough speed to keep the flywheel moving.\n\nEnough control to stay relaxed.\n\n**What About Damper Setting?**\n\nMost people are way too high.\n\nJames recommends:\n\n**Men:**Start around **5\u20136**, some even lower **Women:**Many should be **1\u20132**, especially lighter athletes\n\nHYROX isn\u2019t a max-power ski test. You don\u2019t need to bully the machine.\n\nYou need to\n\n**get through the resistance quickly and rhythmically.** **Fix Your Technique in 10 Seconds**\n\nStop squatting. Start hinging.\n\nThat\u2019s it.\n\nThe moment you turn the SkiErg into a squat workout, you\u2019re donating your running legs to the pain gods. The SkiErg should feel like a controlled, athletic hinge \u2014 load, hit, release. No grinding. No dragging the handles into your ankles.\n\nFind your green zone and stay there.\n\n## RowErg: The Station Everyone Gets Wrong in HYROX\n\nHere\u2019s a spicy take:\n\n**The rower is not where you should be suffering.**\n\nIt\u2019s the midpoint of the race. Your legs are cooked. The sleds are still waiting.\n\nYou need to move fast without giving away precious energy.\n\n**Stroke Rate Reality Check**\n\nMost HYROX athletes row too low.\n\n**26\u201330 SPM**is the money range for most people\n\nLower stroke rates = heavier pulls = more leg fatigue\n\nA slightly higher rate = lighter strokes = easier to sustain\n\nMeg even rows ~31 SPM when she\u2019s in rhythm \u2014 and she\u2019s one of the best in the world.\n\n**Damper / Drag Factor**\n\nStandard elite rowing drag factor sits around:\n\n**Men:**~130 **Women:**~120\n\nFor HYROX? You probably don\u2019t need to go any higher.\n\nEven James \u2014 with multiple world records \u2014 only goes slightly up for max-power tests.\n\nIn a race environment, lighter drag keeps your strokes snappy and repeatable.\n\n## Pacing the ERGs: The Science is Simple\n\nJames breaks it down beautifully:\n\nHYROX SkiErg pace should land around\n\n**your 5K run effort**, not a death sprint\n\nRowErg pace should typically be\n\n**2K pace + 10 seconds per 500m**\n\nBoth machines should feel\n\n*strong but controlled*\u2014 not like you're hunting PRs\n\nIf your HR spikes early, you're cooked for the next mile.\n\nDial it down. Stay in control. You're racing 8K, not 800m.\n\n## Should You Train ERGs or Just Do Sims?\n\nThis part might save your whole season:\n\nSingle-modality ERG training builds your engine way better than random HYROX sims.\n\nSims have a purpose \u2014 especially early on to understand transitions \u2014 but they shouldn\u2019t be the backbone of your program.\n\nInstead:\n\nSkiErg intervals\n\nRowErg aerobic blocks\n\nThreshold work\n\nLong steady efforts\n\nThese build aerobic power without beating up your joints.\n\nSims = sharpening\n\nERGs = evolving your fitness\n\n## The Conversation HYROX Needed \u2014 Judging, Doping, and Fairness\n\nMeg shares openly that she\u2019s had:\n\nA head judge assigned to her every race\n\nOut-of-race doping tests\n\nProtocol changes through the elite license program\n\nHYROX is tightening the screws \u2014 in a good way.\n\nCleaner sport. More consistent standards. Better integrity at the top.\n\nAs the sport grows, this stuff matters.\n\n## Efficiency Wins Races\n\nIf you want to stop blowing up in HYROX, start here:\n\nSki lighter and smoother\n\nRow faster and easier\n\nKeep your HR under control\n\nBuild your engine with deliberate ERG training\n\nStop guessing your damper and stroke rate\n\nTreat the machines as rhythm stations, not hero attempts\n\nDo this consistently and your whole race changes.\n\n## Ready to Go Deeper? Listen to the Full Episode\n\n\n\n**Listen to the full RMR Training Podcast episode here**\n\nIf this helped, share it with a training partner who\u2019s still skiing at damper 9. They need it.\n\nIf you want structured HYROX training that takes all the guesswork out of pacing, ERGs, strength work, and race strategy\u2026 we\u2019ve got you.\n\n",

Let me compile this into the complete knowledge base.\n\n---\n\n# HYROX TECHNIQUE & PACING KNOWLEDGE BASE v2.0\n## For AI-Powered Hyrox Coach \u2014 Evidence-Based, Coach-Sourced\n\n---\n\n## 1. SLED PUSH TECHNIQUE \u2014 Expert Consensus\n\n### The Arm Position Debate\n\n**\u26a0\ufe0f V1 CORRECTION: \"Arms locked out\" is NOT universally a mistake. It is a legitimate technique used by pro athletes. The coach should present this as a technique choice, not an error.**\n\nThere are **three** primary sled push techniques used in competitive Hyrox, each with distinct advocates:\n\n#### Technique 1: Bent Arms / Front Rack (90-120\u00b0)\n- **Advocates:** HyroxTrainingPlans.com coaching team; widely recommended for intermediate athletes\n- **Reasoning:** Arms act as connectors, not pushers. Legs generate 4x more power than shoulders. Bent arms transmit leg power to sled while keeping the athlete's center of mass close to the sled.\n- **Data Point:** Biomechanics research cited by HyroxTrainingPlans suggests straight arms increase shoulder fatigue by 15-20% compared to bent arms\n- **Best for:** Most athletes, especially those with weaker upper bodies or shoulder issues\n- **Drawback:** Requires some shoulder endurance to maintain position\n\n#### Technique 2: Full Lockout / Extended Arms\n- **Advocates:** TheProgrm (HYROX training program); Tiago Lousa (HYROX Master Trainer) notes this works for shorter athletes; used by some pro athletes\n- **Reasoning:** Creates a \"stacked\" position that can be less tiring if done correctly. Upper back extension creates efficient force transfer. Eliminates the shoulder fatigue of holding bent arms.\n- **Best for:** Shorter athletes who can't reach comfortable bent-arm positions; athletes with good shoulder stability; heavier athletes who can use body weight against the sled\n- **Key tip from TheProgrm:** \"Start with arms already locked out \u2014 pressing the sled with your arms first will tire them out for nothing.\"\n- **Drawback:** Can feel less stable; harder to steer through turns\n\n#### Technique 3: Forearm/Shoulder Wrap (The \"Scrum\" Position)\n- **Advocates:** Centr (HYROX official partner \u2014 their guide states \"90% of Elite 15 athletes use forearms on the bar\"); Tiago Lousa (HYROX Master Trainer); dominant among elite men\n- **Reasoning:** Distributes body weight most efficiently onto the sled. Can be \"passive\" (resting shoulders against poles) or \"active\" (pulling up on poles to lift the sled and reduce friction). Saves upper body energy.\n- **Best for:** Heavier athletes, especially elite/pro men who have enough body mass to leverage against the sled\n- **Key insight from Centr:** \"This allows you to best distribute your body weight to drive the sled\"\n- **Drawback:** Requires sufficient height and mass; less accessible for shorter or lighter athletes\n\n#### What Elite Athletes ACTUALLY Do\nPer Centr's analysis: **~90% of Elite 15 athletes use the forearm/wrap technique.** Pro men especially favor this due to their body weight advantage. Lighter athletes and women tend to use either the extended arms or bent arms depending on body proportions.\n\n**COACH RECOMMENDATION:** Present all three techniques. Have athletes experiment in training. The \"best\" technique depends on:\n- Body weight and height relative to sled\n- Upper body vs. lower body strength ratio\n- Shoulder mobility and endurance\n- Surface type on race day\n\n### Other Key Sled Push Technique Points\n\n| Element | Consensus Recommendation | Source |\n|---------|------------------------|--------|\n| **Body angle** | 45-degree torso lean; hips below shoulders. Lower = more horizontal force. Standing too tall pushes DOWN into carpet, increasing friction | HyroxTrainingPlans, Centr, TheProgrm |\n| **Foot position** | Hip-width or slightly wider for stability | Multiple sources |\n| **Step cadence** | Short, choppy, fast steps generally preferred for consistency; some elite athletes use longer strides for more power per step. Tiago Lousa recommends finding your style \u2014 \"very small short fast steps or longer stronger steps\" | Tiago Lousa, TheProgrm |\n| **Foot drive** | Drive through the balls of feet / midfoot, with weight transferring forward | HyroxTrainingPlans |\n| **Head position** | Neutral spine, gaze 6 feet ahead on ground. Head up = compromised spinal alignment = lost power transfer | HyroxTrainingPlans, multiple coaches |\n| **Grip** | Firm but not death-grip. Save forearm energy for sled pull and farmer's carry later | HyroxTrainingPlans |\n| **Starting** | Set position BEFORE first push. Two-foot push-off to break static friction. \"Fall forward\" into sled to use momentum | TheProgrm |\n| **Surface impact** | HYROX turf creates MORE friction than gym floors. Train 10-15% heavier to simulate race conditions | Multiple sources |\n| **Hand width** | Shoulder-width or slightly wider for stability and force distribution | HyroxTrainingPlans |\n\n### Sled Push Weights by Division (2025/26 Season)\n| Division | Weight (incl. sled) |\n|----------|-------------------|\n| Women Open | 102 kg |\n| Women Pro / Men Open | 152 kg |\n| Men Pro | 202 kg |\n\n---\n\n## 2. SLED PULL TECHNIQUE \u2014 Expert Consensus\n\n### Three Primary Techniques\n\n#### 1. Hand-Over-Hand (Arm Over Arm)\n- **Description:** Standing or slightly hinged, pulling rope hand-over-hand using primarily upper body\n- **Speed:** Fastest technique\n- **Sustainability:** Least sustainable; extremely taxing on biceps and forearms; many strong athletes cannot sustain this for full 50m in race context\n- **Best for:** Athletes with exceptional upper body pulling endurance; lighter sled weights\n- **Key tips:** Use short, choppy pulls (not long sweeping ones). Keep non-working hand on rope before pulling arm finishes to maintain momentum. (Source: Hybrid Athlete Club, multiple coaches)\n- **Source quote:** \"The fastest technique but is very tiring or possibly even impossible for you to do\" \u2014 Coach from Hyrox sled pull tutorial\n\n#### 2. Hip Extension / Squat-to-Row (Hybrid)\n- **Description:** Set up like a deadlift position. Explosively extend hips while pulling rope to chest. Uses full body \u2014 legs, glutes, back, arms.\n- **Speed:** Moderate-fast\n- **Sustainability:** Good; distributes load across larger muscle groups\n- **Best for:** Most athletes; TheProgrm's recommended technique for their HYROX athletes\n- **Key detail from TheProgrm:** They recommend a HYBRID \u2014 initial hip drive pull followed by walking backward steps. \"First you want to get your hips involved... once the sled is moving, keep hips extended, core engaged, arms long, then walk it back\"\n- **Source:** TheProgrm, ProAthleteGuide (Crush the HYROX sled pull video)\n\n#### 3. Walk-Back Method\n- **Description:** Lean back with arms extended, use body weight to pull sled while walking backward\n- **Speed:** Slowest\n- **Sustainability:** Most sustainable; easiest on upper body\n- **Best for:** Pro division (heavier sleds); athletes with weaker upper body pulling strength\n- **Key tip:** Keep arms STRAIGHT to spare biceps. Let body weight do the work.\n- **Source:** Hybrid Athlete Club, TheProgrm\n\n### Universal Setup Points (ALL Techniques)\n1. **Take slack out of rope FIRST** \u2014 ropes are slightly stretchy; every inch of slack = wasted effort\n2. **Set up like a deadlift** \u2014 feet hip-width, neutral spine, core braced\n3. **Foot bracing** \u2014 feet right at front of white line; press through floor; wider stance than you might think\n4. **Rope management** \u2014 be aware of excess rope at your feet; drop rope between pulls if preferred\n5. **Don't wrap rope around arms** \u2014 wastes time and risks injury\n\n### Common Mistakes\n- Not removing slack before pulling\n- Pulling too high (above chest level)\n- Rounding the back / poor spinal position\n- Large sweeping arm movements (instead of short, quick pulls)\n- Standing too upright \u2014 reduces force generation\n- Not bracing feet properly \u2014 sliding forward instead of moving the sled\n\n### Sled Pull Weights (2025/26 Season)\n| Division | Weight (incl. sled) |\n|----------|-------------------|\n| Women Open | 78 kg |\n| Women Pro / Men Open | 103 kg |\n| Men Pro | 153 kg |\n\n### Breathing Pattern\nInhale as you prepare/reach for rope; exhale forcefully as you execute the pull. Maintain rhythmic pattern.\n\n---\n\n## 3. BURPEE BROAD JUMP (BBJ) TECHNIQUE & TIMES\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f V1 CORRECTION: BBJ time of 2:45 in a 75-minute plan was UNREALISTICALLY FAST\n\n**Context:** The elite men's *median* BBJ time from the top 15 all-time HYROX performances is **2:21** (Source: RoxLyfe \"Average to Elite\" analysis). The average Men's Pro BBJ time is **4:35**, and average Men's Open is **5:45**. A 2:45 BBJ in a 75-minute overall plan is faster than most elite athletes \u2014 absurd for an intermediate athlete.\n\n### Movement Standards (2025/26 Season)\n- Start standing, hands behind the line\n- Hands placed near feet (max one foot length away); once placed, cannot move forward\n- **Chest MUST touch the ground** (full chest-to-floor required)\n- Stand up and jump forward \u2014 both feet must take off AND land simultaneously\n- Jump length is athlete's choice\n- **No forward steps between reps**\n- Station complete when athlete jumps across 80m finish line\n- Violations: 1st = warning, 2nd = 5m distance penalty\n- Feet cannot pass fingertips when rising from ground\n\n### Technique Points\n\n**The Burpee Portion:**\n- **Step-down vs. jump-back:** Step-down (placing one knee then the other) is slower per rep BUT more sustainable for heart rate management. Jump-back is faster per rep but spikes HR quickly. Elite athletes typically use jump-back. Intermediate athletes often benefit from step-down.\n- **Getting up:** Step-up (one foot at a time) is more sustainable; jump-up is faster but more taxing\n- Key from Tiago Lousa: \"When you are coming down from the ground it takes a little longer because you are firstly placing one knee on the ground and then the front foot on the ground \u2014 this is slow but also your heart rate can [stay lower]\"\n\n**The Broad Jump Portion:**\n- **Jump distance:** Don't maximize \u2014 moderate, consistent jumps are optimal. Very long jumps are taxing on legs and HR. Most athletes cover 80m in **40-60 reps**.\n- **Arm swing:** Swing arms forward for momentum \u2014 \"generates additional momentum and keeps body balanced\"\n- **Landing:** Land softly, absorb impact, transition immediately into next burpee\n- **Breathing:** Inhale during burpee descent, exhale forcefully on the jump\n\n**Key Strategic Insight from Tiago Lousa:** \"Don't do short bursts and then try to recover because your heart rate will peak very very quickly and then it will be very hard to get it back down.\" Consistent pacing > fast start + rest breaks.\n\n### Realistic BBJ Time Benchmarks\n**Based on actual race data (Source: TheRoxZone/HyroXY 2026 averages & RoxLyfe Elite analysis):**\n\n| Athlete Level | Overall Finish Target | Realistic BBJ Time | Source/Reasoning |\n|--------------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------| \n| World-Class Elite (Men Pro) | ~55-60 min | 2:00-2:30 | Top 15 all-time median: 2:21 (RoxLyfe) |\n| Strong Pro (Men) | ~65-70 min | 3:00-4:00 | Below average Pro time of 4:35 |\n| Average Pro / Elite Open (Men) | ~75-80 min | 4:00-5:30 | Average Men Pro: 4:35; Average Men Open: 5:45 |\n| Competitive Open (Men) | ~80-90 min | 5:00-6:30 | Around Men's Open average |\n| Recreational / First-Timer (Men) | ~90-110 min | 6:30-9:00+ | Well above average |\n| Elite Pro (Women) | ~65 min | 3:00-3:30 | Top 15 median: ~3:11 (RoxLyfe) |\n| Average Pro (Women) | ~85 min | 5:00-5:30 | Average Women Pro: 5:22 |\n| Average Open (Women) | ~100 min | 6:30-7:30 | Average Women Open: 7:09 |\n\n---\n\n## 4. SKIERG TECHNIQUE & PACING\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f V1 CORRECTION: 35-40 SPM is NOT \"too high\" \u2014 it depends on the source and athlete\n\n**The actual expert consensus is nuanced and source-dependent:**\n\n| Source | Recommended SPM Range | Context |\n|--------|----------------------|---------|\n| **James Hall** (world-record erg athlete, via RMR Training Podcast) | **40-48 SPM** | \"The sweet spot for most HYROX athletes.\" Says 30 SPM is \"too heavy, too much muscular fatigue\" and 60 SPM is \"too frantic\" |\n| **SkiErg for Hyrox video coach** | **35-45 SPM** | \"Anywhere between 35 and 45 strokes per minute is probably going to be a good place\" |\n| **Dr. Alyssa Olenick / Coach Corey Davis** | **Individual \u2014 test to find yours** | Stronger athletes = lower SPM (more power per stroke, more recovery); more aerobic athletes = higher SPM |\n\n**CORRECTED GUIDANCE for the AI coach:**\n- **Beginner race pace:** 35-42 SPM (lighter, faster strokes to keep flywheel moving without excessive muscular fatigue)\n- **Intermediate race pace:** 38-45 SPM\n- **Elite race pace:** 40-48 SPM\n- **Key principle:** Higher SPM than most people think. The internet myth of \"low SPM = efficient\" is wrong per James Hall. Too-low SPM creates too much muscular load per stroke.\n- **Why going above 48-50 SPM is counterproductive:** Becomes cardiovascularly expensive, form breaks down, can't generate meaningful power per stroke\n\n### SkiErg Technique\n- **HINGE, don't squat.** The #1 mistake. Turning SkiErg into a squat movement donates your running legs to fatigue. Should feel like an athletic hip hinge \u2014 load, hit, release.\n- **Breathing:** Exhale on the pull/drive down, inhale on recovery (1:1 with strokes)\n- **Damper Settings:**\n  - Men: Start around **5-6** (some even lower)\n  - Women: Many should be **1-2**, especially lighter athletes\n  - \"HYROX isn't a max-power ski test. You don't need to bully the machine.\" \u2014 James Hall\n\n### SkiErg Pacing Strategy\n- **Target effort level:** ~5K run effort (strong but controlled, NOT a death sprint)\n- **Pacing formula:** If you know your 2K ski pace, race at **2K pace + 5-10 sec/500m**. If you know your 5K ski pace, that's approximately your HYROX target.\n- **Strategy:** Even pacing or slight negative split. First 250m should be conservative \u2014 don't spike HR early.\n- **Key insight from RoxLyfe elite analysis:** The difference between elite and average ski times is only ~30 seconds (men) / ~39 seconds (women). Going 5 sec/500m slower can SIGNIFICANTLY lower HR, costing only 10 seconds total \u2014 a worthwhile trade.\n\n### SkiErg 500m Split Targets by Finish Time\n\n| Overall Finish Target | Approximate 500m Ski Split | Total 1000m Time |\n|----------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|\n| 60 min (Elite Pro) | ~1:50-1:55 | ~3:45-3:50 |\n| 70 min (Strong) | ~2:00-2:10 | ~4:00-4:15 |\n| 80 min (Competitive Open) | ~2:10-2:15 | ~4:20-4:30 |\n| 90 min (Average) | ~2:15-2:25 | ~4:30-4:50 |\n| 100+ min (Beginner) | ~2:30-2:45 | ~5:00-5:30 |\n\n---\n\n## 5. ROWING TECHNIQUE & PACING IN HYROX\n\n### Hyrox-Specific Rowing Context\n- **Station 5** \u2014 the midpoint of the race. The ONLY seated station. Strategic recovery opportunity.\n- After 5km running + 4 stations, legs are already fatigued\n- Everything after rowing requires standing/loaded movement\n- \"The rower is not where you should be suffering.\" \u2014 RMR Training\n\n### Damper Settings\n**HYROX presets the damper for each division:**\n- Women Open: Preset to **5**\n- Women Pro / Men Open: Preset to **6**\n- Men Pro: Preset to **7**\n\nAthletes CAN adjust during the station. However, most coaches recommend staying near preset or going slightly lower.\n\n**Drag Factor recommendations (for training \u2014 to match race-day feel):**\n| Division | Target Drag Factor | Source |\n|----------|-------------------|--------|\n| Women (preset 5) | ~130-135 | Rowing for Hyrox video |\n| Women Pro / Men (preset 6) | ~145 | Rowing for Hyrox video |\n| Men Pro (preset 7) | ~165 | Rowing for Hyrox video |\n\n**Elite racing drag factor:** Men ~130, Women ~120 (Source: James Hall via RMR Training \u2014 \"lighter drag keeps your strokes snappy and repeatable\")\n\n**Critical training note:** Gym rowers accumulate dirt, which reduces airflow at the same damper setting. Use DRAG FACTOR (not damper number) to calibrate your training machine to match race conditions.\n\n### Stroke Rate for Hyrox Rowing\n- **Target:** 24-28 SPM for most athletes (Source: OnlyGains)\n- **James Hall / RMR Training:** 26-30 SPM is the \"money range.\" \"Most HYROX athletes row too low. Lower stroke rate = heavier pulls = more leg fatigue.\"\n- **Elite example:** Meg Martin (one of the best in the world) rows ~31 SPM in race rhythm\n- **Too slow (under 22):** Leaving time on the table; each stroke too heavy\n- **Too fast (over 32):** Getting sloppy, wasting energy\n\n### Rowing Technique\n- **Drive sequence:** Legs \u2192 Back \u2192 Arms (ALWAYS in that order)\n- **Recovery sequence:** Arms \u2192 Back \u2192 Legs (reverse of drive)\n- **Power ratio:** 85% legs, 10% core, 5% arms\n- **Handle finish:** Lower chest/upper stomach (NOT chin/neck level)\n- **Grip:** Loose hook grip \u2014 not death grip (save forearms for farmer's carry)\n- **Recovery timing:** Should take ~2x as long as the drive phase\n- **Key HYROX insight:** Your arms are already fatigued from SkiErg, sled pull, and burpees. LEG DRIVE is your advantage.\n\n### Rowing Pacing Strategy\n**Pacing formula:** Your 2K pace + 10 seconds per 500m (Source: James Hall)\n\n**Negative split is recommended** \u2014 start conservative, finish fast.\n\n| Approach | 0-250m | 250-750m | 750-1000m | Total Time | Best For |\n|----------|--------|----------|-----------|------------|----------|\n| Conservative (\"Recovery\") | 2:05-2:10/500m | 2:05-2:10/500m | 1:55-2:00/500m | ~4:00-4:15 | Struggling athletes; use as active recovery |\n| Steady State (\"Time Saver\") | 1:55-2:00/500m | 1:50-1:55/500m | 1:45-1:50/500m | ~3:40-3:50 | Racing for time, feeling okay |\n| Aggressive (\"Send It\") | 1:45-1:50/500m | 1:42-1:47/500m | 1:40-1:45/500m | ~3:20-3:30 | Elite athletes who can recover on the run |\n\n### Common Rowing Mistakes\n1. Pulling with arms before legs extend\n2. Hunching/rounding back at the catch\n3. Rushing the recovery (should be controlled)\n4. Damper setting too high (4-6 is sufficient for most)\n5. Death grip on handle (fries forearms before farmer's carry)\n6. Going too hard and spiking HR at the race midpoint\n\n---\n\n## 6. WALL BALL TECHNIQUE\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f V1 CORRECTION: Target heights now confirmed from official HYROX rulebook\n\n### Target Heights & Ball Weights (2025/26 Season \u2014 OFFICIAL)\n\n| Division | Ball Weight | Target Height |\n|----------|-----------|--------------|\n| Women Open | 4 kg (white marking) | **2.70 m (8'10\")** |\n| Women Pro | 6 kg (grey marking) | **2.70 m (8'10\")** |\n| Men Open | 6 kg (grey marking) | **3.00 m (9'10\")** |\n| Men Pro | 9 kg (black marking) | **3.00 m (9'10\")** |\n\n**Note for Women Open:** 75 reps (not 100). All other singles divisions: 100 reps.\n\n### Wall Ball Technique\n- **Squat:** Full depth (hip crease below knee; referee may use a box to verify). Vertical torso.\n- **Drive:** Explosive upward drive from LEGS \u2014 the throw is powered by the squat, not the arms\n- **Arms:** Keep relaxed during descent; arms guide the ball, legs power the throw\n- **Catch:** Receive ball in front rack position, absorb into squat\n- **Breathing:** Inhale on descent/catch, exhale on throw (Source: RMR Training, multiple coaches)\n- **Rhythm:** Minimize pause at the bottom. Consistent cadence is more important than speed per rep.\n- **Cadence:** The speed you drop and pop back up makes an \"incredible difference for how long you're under load\" \u2014 Elite 15 athlete\n\n### Break Strategy for 100 Reps\n**From Elite 15 Athlete (Proven Wall Ball Strategies video):**\n- **If you can do 50+ unbroken:** \"If you can come in there and knock out half of the wall balls right away, you're setting yourself up for such an easier time in the long term.\" Then do smaller sets for the second half (e.g., 50 + sets of 25, or 50 + sets of 10-15).\n- **If you cannot do 50 unbroken:** Use smaller, planned sets with very short rests. Having a plan is critical.\n\n**From RoxLyfe:** \"More frequent, but very quick rests, may help your overall time. For example, if you can complete 40 reps unbroken from the start, but that leaves you exhausted... 15 reps each set with a short rest in between might be a better strategy.\"\n\n**Recommended Break Patterns:**\n\n| Athlete Level | Strategy | Rationale |\n|--------------|----------|-----------|\n| Elite (can do 100 unbroken in training) | Unbroken or 50/50 | Fastest possible time; Red Bull patch for 100 unbroken |\n| Advanced (can do 60+ unbroken fresh) | 50/25/25 or 40/30/30 | Big first set, then manageable remainder |\n| Intermediate (30-50 unbroken fresh) | 25/25/25/25 or 20/20/20/20/20 | Consistent sets, very brief rests |\n| Beginner (under 25 unbroken) | Sets of 10-15 with 10-15 sec rest | Avoid going to failure; keep rest periods fixed |\n\n**Key principle:** Train to find your sustainable set size. Test with a max wall ball assessment, then race at 60-70% of your max unbroken number per set.\n\n**Mental strategy from Elite 15 athlete:** \"Every 10 reps, I visualize myself completing 100 meters on a track. Every rep after that, I'm completing 10m, 20m, 50m.\"\n\n---\n\n## 7. FARMER'S CARRY TECHNIQUE\n\n### Weights & Distance (2025/26 Season)\n| Division | Weight | Distance |\n|----------|--------|----------|\n| Women Open | 2 \u00d7 16 kg | 200m |\n| Women Pro / Men Open | 2 \u00d7 24 kg | 200m |\n| Men Pro | 2 \u00d7 32 kg | 200m |\n\n### Grip Strategy (Critical \u2014 This Is the Limiting Factor)\n**From TheProgrm (HYROX specialist program):**\n1. **Start with a \"deep\" / false grip:** Handle sits in your palms, not fingers. More taxing on wrist/forearm muscles but SPARES finger strength (usually the limiting factor).\n2. **Natural transition:** As false grip gives out, you'll naturally transition to a neutral finger-dominant grip. This buys you several more meters per set.\n3. **Don't death-grip:** Firm but not maximum squeeze. You've still got sandbag lunges and wall balls after this.\n\n**Wrist angle:** Slight wrist flexion angle (handle below calluses/main finger joints) activates forearms more for a stronger grip. (Source: TheProgrm video)\n\n### Walking Technique\n- **Posture:** Stand TALL. Shoulders back, chest proud. Core braced. Arms fully extended at sides.\n- **Gait:** Hip-width or slightly narrower stance. Normal walking gait \u2014 don't waddle.\n- **Speed:** Walk briskly but not run. This is a posture/grip station, not a sprint.\n- **Pickup:** Deadlift the kettlebells with good form \u2014 bend knees minimally, back straight, brace core.\n\n### Break Strategy\n**TheProgrm's recommended approach: \"Short but quick\"**\n- Break **10-20m BEFORE you think you'll reach grip failure**\n- This avoids excessive lactate buildup in forearms\n- Keep breaks VERY short (10 seconds is enough to restore grip without wasting time \u2014 Source: Hyrox Farmer's Carry tutorial)\n- **Multiple short planned breaks > one long unplanned break after total grip failure**\n\n**From TheProgrm:** \"The most successful approach we have found with our athletes... consists of breaking sooner than you plan... Overall the goal is to aim to break up the distance a little more frequently than what your max capacity would allow but ensure that those breaks are very quick.\"\n\n### Strategic Positioning in the Race\nThis is Station 6 \u2014 the Farmer's Carry can serve as a **relative recovery station** (lower intensity, lower HR than many other stations) IF you have adequate grip endurance. It's the only station with turns every ~25m.\n\n### Realistic Time Targets\n\n| Level | Target Time | Notes |\n|-------|------------|-------|\n| Elite Pro (Men) | 1:30-2:00 | Elite median: 1:37 (RoxLyfe) |\n| Elite Pro (Women) | 1:45-2:15 | Elite median: 1:57 |\n| Average Pro (Men) | 2:00-2:30 | Average: 2:02 |\n| Average Open (Men) | 2:00-2:30 | Average: 2:10 |\n| Average Open (Women) | 2:00-2:30 | Average: 2:16 |\n| Beginner | 3:00-4:00+ | Dropping KBs multiple times |\n\n---\n\n## 8. SANDBAG LUNGE TECHNIQUE\n\n### Weights & Distance (2025/26 Season)\n| Division | Weight | Distance |\n|----------|--------|----------|\n| Women Open | 10 kg | 100m |\n| Women Pro / Men Open | 20 kg | 100m |\n| Men Pro | 30 kg | 100m |\n\n### Movement Standards\n- Rear knee **MUST touch the ground** every rep\n- **Alternate legs** (left, right, left, right)\n- **No steps between reps** \u2014 you may pause standing between reps with both feet on ground\n- **Sandbag MUST stay on both shoulders at all times**\n- **Putting the sandbag down = 5 second penalty. Second time = DISQUALIFICATION.**\n- Full stand between each rep (straighten knee and hip)\n- Foot must completely cross all white lines including turning points and finish line\n\n### How to Hold the Sandbag\n**Two main holds:**\n\n1. **Shoulder/Back Position (Recommended by most coaches):**\n   - Sandbag sits across BOTH shoulders, behind head\n   - Use center handles (gets bag closer to center of gravity) \u2014 Source: TheProgrm\n   - Pull sandbag in tight\n   - **Once secure, RELAX your arms** \u2014 \"You should be so relaxed that you can let go of one handle and let your arm drop\" (Hybrid Athlete Club)\n\n2. **Getting it up:** Pick up with a hip hinge/swing motion. Swing between legs to generate momentum, then use hip power to get it to shoulder. (Source: TheProgrm sandbag tutorial)\n\n**Bear hug** is NOT the standard competitive hold \u2014 shoulder carry is almost universally preferred as it allows for more upright torso position and frees the arms somewhat.\n\n### Step Length Optimization\n- **Trailing knee directly underneath hips** \u2014 creates a \"stacked\" position (Source: Hybrid Athlete Club)\n- Don't over-stride \u2014 shorter, controlled steps waste less energy\n- Keep torso as upright as possible; avoid folding forward under the bag\n- Distribute weight evenly between front and back legs\n\n### Managing Quad Fatigue\nThis is Station 7 \u2014 by this point you've done 7km of running, sled push, sled pull, BBJs, rowing, and farmer's carries. Your quads are already taxed.\n\n**Key strategies:**\n- Pace the lunges \u2014 don't go out too fast and blow up\n- Focus on glute engagement (not just quads) \u2014 \"squeeze glutes\" through each rep\n- Train lunges under fatigue in training (after running + other exercises)\n- Build joint tolerance with progressive training (deep split squats, heel-elevated squats)\n- **RoxLyfe critical insight:** \"Practice in training, during certain sessions, moving from running into lunges and back into running.\" The run AFTER lunges is the cruelest part of the race.\n\n### Why This Station Destroys the Final Run\n- 100m of weighted alternating lunges is massive eccentric quad loading\n- Quads are the primary running muscle\n- Final 1km run immediately follows with destroyed quads\n- Athletes often describe the final run as the hardest kilometer of the race despite being the last\n- **Training implication:** ALWAYS practice running immediately after lunges in training\n\n---\n\n## 9. STATION-SPECIFIC BREATHING PATTERNS\n\n| Station | Breathing Pattern | Notes |\n|---------|------------------|-------|\n| **SkiErg** | Exhale on pull/drive down, inhale on recovery | 1:1 with strokes. Keep rhythmic. |\n| **Sled Push** | Rhythmic breathing matched to steps; exhale on drive phase of each step | Don't hold breath. Some athletes use 2-step breathing (exhale every 2 steps). Avoid Valsalva for extended push. |\n| **Sled Pull** | Inhale as you prepare/reach for rope; exhale forcefully on the pull | Match breathing to pull rhythm. Core braced throughout. |\n| **Burpee Broad Jumps** | Inhale during descent to ground; exhale on the jump | Key from HyroXY: \"Inhale deeply as you go down into the burpee and exhale forcefully as you launch into the jump.\" This optimizes oxygen flow. Maintain CONSISTENCY \u2014 erratic breathing spikes HR. |\n| **Rowing** | Exhale on the drive (push); inhale on the recovery (slide forward) | Match to stroke cadence. Recovery = controlled rest = breathing opportunity. |\n| **Farmer's Carry** | Rhythmic nasal breathing if possible; exhale through mouth if HR is high | This station CAN allow HR recovery. Focus on controlled, steady breathing. Don't hold breath. |\n| **Sandbag Lunges** | Exhale on the way UP from each lunge; inhale on the way DOWN | Controlled exertion breathing.

Most first-timers finish 100-120 minutes. The plan above totals ~99 minutes to be more realistic. For a genuine 90-minute plan, run splits need to average ~5:15/km and stations must be efficient. This requires solid base fitness.\n\n**Adjusted strict 90:00 budget:**\n\n| Component | Time Budget |\n|-----------|------------|\n| 8 \u00d7 1km Runs | 44:00 (avg 5:30/km) |\n| 8 Stations | 37:00 (avg ~4:37/station) |\n| RoxZone Total | 9:00 (avg ~1:08/transition) |\n| **TOTAL** | **90:00** |\n\n---\n\n### HOW EACH STATION AFFECTS THE SUBSEQUENT RUN\n\n| Station Just Completed | Impact on Following Run | Key Management Strategy |\n|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| **After SkiErg** | **Arms:** Fatigued (lats, shoulders). **Legs:** Slightly loaded from hinging but generally OK. **HR:** Elevated, especially if paced too aggressively. | Start run conservatively. Shake arms out. Don't sprint the first 200m \u2014 let HR settle. |\n| **After Sled Push** | **Legs:** Quads heavily loaded (pushing motion). Calves fatigued from toe-driving. **Arms:** Shoulders may be tight (especially bent-arm technique). **HR:** Very elevated from anaerobic effort. | This is often the run where pacing discipline matters most. Walk first 50m of RoxZone if needed. Settle before running. |\n| **After Sled Pull** | **Arms/Grip:** Biceps, forearms, and lats are pumped. **Legs:** Less taxed than sled push (more upper body). **HR:** Moderately elevated. **Back:** Tight from pulling position. | Good run to find rhythm. Arms will feel heavy but legs should be relatively fresh compared to sled push. |\n| **After BBJs** | **EVERYTHING:** Full-body fatigue. Quads from jumping, shoulders from burpees, HR through the roof. This is the halfway point and often the worst athletes feel in the entire race. | This is the \"dark moment\" of HYROX. The run after BBJ is where many athletes lose their pacing plan. Start VERY slow. Walk if needed for first 100m. Find rhythm gradually. |\n| **After Rowing** | **Legs:** Quads and glutes loaded from leg drive. **Posterior chain:** Hamstrings and back worked. **HR:** Should be moderate if paced well (seated = some recovery). **Grip:** Minimally affected if hook grip was used. | Ideally you feel BETTER starting this run than the one after BBJs. The row should serve as partial recovery. Stand up slowly \u2014 blood has been in seated position. |\n| **After Farmer's Carry** | **Forearms/Grip:** Pumped and fatigued \u2014 the limiting factor. **Shoulders:** Tight from stabilizing heavy KBs. **Core:** Fatigued from bracing. **Legs:** Relatively fresh (just walking). **HR:** Should be moderate-low. | This run should feel surprisingly good on legs. Shake out grip. This can be one of your better runs if grip didn't force excessive stopping. |\n| **After Sandbag Lunges** | **Quads:** DESTROYED. Massive eccentric loading from 100m of weighted lunges. **Glutes/Hips:** Very fatigued. **Core/Arms:** Moderate fatigue from holding bag. **HR:** High from sustained effort. | THE HARDEST RUN. Expect 15-30+ seconds/km slower than earlier runs. Start walking if needed. Short, quick steps. Don't try to stride long \u2014 your quads won't allow it. Elite men's Run 8 is ~30 sec slower than Run 1. Average men: >2 min slower. |\n| **After Wall Balls** | **Quads:** Further punished (deep squats \u00d7 100). **Shoulders:** Fatigued from throwing. **HR:** High. **Everything:** General fatigue but adrenaline of finishing kicks in. | You're done \u2014 it's just the sprint to the finish line through the RoxZone. Empty the tank. This is where crowd energy helps. |\n\n---\n\n### KEY PACING PRINCIPLES (Supported by Data)\n\n1. **Even pacing is the gold standard** \u2014 Athletes who pace within 10% variance across runs finish 5-10% faster than those who sprint-and-fade (Source: HyroxDataLab)\n\n2. **Men especially need to hold back early** \u2014 RoxLyfe analysis shows elite men's runs are much flatter across the race vs. average men who go too fast on Run 1 and pay for it later. Women are naturally 18.33% better at even pacing (per marathon studies).\n\n3. **RoxZone time is \"free time\"** \u2014 Elite men spend ~3 minutes total; average men spend ~7 minutes. That's 4 minutes of wasted time just from walking/stopping in transitions.\n\n4. **The biggest time differentiators** between elite and average are: Sled Pull (3:17 gap for men), Wall Balls (3:13 gap), Burpee Broad Jumps (2:54 gap), and RoxZone (4:04 gap). SkiErg and Rowing have the SMALLEST gaps (~30 seconds). Train accordingly.\n\n5. **Don't \"win\" the SkiErg or Row** \u2014 Going 10 seconds slower on SkiErg can save significant HR, potentially saving you 30+ seconds on the subsequent run and sled push. These machines are rhythm stations, not hero moments.\n\n---\n\n*Knowledge base compiled February 2026.
