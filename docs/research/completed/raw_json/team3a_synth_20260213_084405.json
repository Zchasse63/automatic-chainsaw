Replace Olympic lifting days with Hyrox-specific station practice (wall balls \u00d7100, sled push/pull, rowing 1km, burpee broad jumps \u00d780m)\n2. Add 2\u20133 weekly running sessions at varied intensities (Zone 2 base, tempo, race-pace intervals)\n3. Retain the EMOM/interval conditioning format but swap CrossFit movements for Hyrox station movements\n4. Keep the 5-3-1 strength progression but focus on squat, deadlift, and lunges (eliminate strict press emphasis)\n5. Use the PRVN HYROX track directly if available, supplementing with additional running volume\n\n### Key Programming Principles for AI Coach Extraction\n\n1. **Themed daily structure** with clear intent (strength day, aerobic day, sprint day) \u2014 the AI should assign a daily purpose\n2. **Multi-level scaling** (Level 1/2/3) based on athlete capability \u2014 the AI should auto-prescribe the appropriate level\n3. **Percentage-based strength work** building through 5-3-1 progressions to 1RM testing\n4. **Named training cycles** with transition phases \u2014 the AI should plan in 6\u20138 week mesocycles\n5. **60-minute session architecture** with time blocks \u2014 the AI should structure every session with warm-up, primer, main work, conditioning, and mobility\n6. **Balanced time-domain exposure** across the week (short sprint, medium grind, long endurance)\n7. **Integrated mobility** within the session, not optional afterthought\n\n---\n\n## 2. HWPO (Hard Work Pays Off \u2014 Mat Fraser)\n\n### Program Overview\n\nHWPO Training is Mat Fraser's post-retirement programming platform, launched after his fifth consecutive CrossFit Games championship. The platform has grown into a comprehensive multi-tier system targeting athletes from casual fitness enthusiasts to elite competitors.\n\n| Program | Duration/Session | Frequency | Target Athlete | Monthly Cost |\n|---------|-----------------|-----------|----------------|-------------|\n| **HWPO Flagship 2.0** | ~2 hours | 4\u20136 days/week | Experienced CrossFitters seeking PRs | $40/month |\n| **Flagship 60** | ~60 minutes | Same schedule | Time-constrained athletes | Included with Flagship |\n| **Flagship Masters** | Adjusted volume | Same schedule | Advancing athletes prioritizing longevity | Included with Flagship |\n| **HWPO PRO** | 2\u20133 hours \u00d7 2 sessions/day | 6 days/week | Top 300 Quarterfinal athletes | Separate pricing |\n| **HWPO Classic** | Varies | Daily | Community daily WOD (non-progressive) | ~$20/month |\n| **HWPO Sweat** | 45 minutes | Varies | Minimal equipment, general fitness | ~$20/month |\n| **HWPO Strong 2.0** | 60\u201375 minutes | Varies | Strength-focused with optional metcon | Separate pricing |\n| **ALL ACCESS** | All programs | All | Flexible goal-changers | $49/month or $490/year |\n\n(Sources: hwpotraining.com, Rogue Fitness, garagegymrevisited.com, mensfitnesstoday.com)\n\n### Core Philosophy\n\nFraser's programming philosophy centers on several principles derived from his competitive career:\n\n1. **Percentage-based progression:** All strength training is based on 1RM percentages, with RPE tools available for athletes who haven't yet tested maxes. This ensures individualization at scale.\n2. **Phase-based structure aligned to the CrossFit season:** Flagship 2.0 follows \"thoughtfully designed PHASES that progress strength and work capacity, tailored to the CROSSFIT SEASON\" culminating with the Open and Quarterfinals.\n3. **Community synchronization:** Unlike the original Flagship (where everyone started on Day 1 regardless of join date), Flagship 2.0 has all athletes on the same training day for \"better coaching support, real-time leaderboards, and sharing your fitness journey.\"\n4. **Deload intelligence:** The program uses 4-week blocks with 3 weeks on and 1 deload week. Two 4-week blocks form an 8-week cycle, and the macro structure operates in 16-week super-cycles (16-16-16).\n5. **Intensity through forced breaks:** Rather than long unbroken AMRAPs, Fraser programs short work windows with built-in rest (e.g., 4 \u00d7 2-min AMRAPs with 1-min rest) to force higher intensity output per window.\n\n(Sources: garagegymrevisited.com, YouTube review transcript, hwpotraining.com)\n\n### Weekly Template\n\n**HWPO Flagship 2.0 Typical Week:**\n\n| Day | Components | Approximate Duration |\n|-----|------------|---------------------|\n| **Day 1** | Warm-up \u2192 Squats (heavy) + Olympic Lift \u2192 Metcon \u2192 Accessories \u2192 (Bonus) | ~2 hours |\n| **Day 2** | Warm-up \u2192 Front Squats (lighter) + Pressing \u2192 Rowing/Bike piece \u2192 Accessories | ~2 hours |\n| **Day 3** | Warm-up \u2192 Deadlift + Olympic Lift \u2192 Metcon \u2192 Accessories \u2192 (Bonus) | ~2 hours |\n| **Day 4** | Warm-up \u2192 Bench Press + Gymnastics \u2192 Conditioning piece \u2192 Accessories | ~1.5\u20132 hours |\n| **Day 5** | Warm-up \u2192 40-min EMOM or longer conditioning \u2192 Accessories | ~1.5\u20132 hours |\n| **Day 6** | Active recovery: light spin bike, swimming, or easy run | 30\u201360 min |\n| **Day 7** | Full rest | \u2014 |\n\n**Key structural patterns:**\n- **Squats 2\u00d7/week:** One heavy back squat day, one lighter front squat day\n- **Deadlifts 1\u00d7/week**\n- **Bench press 1\u00d7/week**\n- **Olympic lifts ~3\u00d7/week** with volume varying by cycle\n- **Rowing appears heavily** throughout \u2014 Fraser is a known rowing advocate\n- **10\u201322+ working strength sets** per session before conditioning\n- **Metcons last 12\u201320 minutes** typically\n- **Accessories always present;** bonus work (often Zone 2 cardio) is optional\n\n(Source: garagegymrevisited.com)\n\n### Session Structure: HWPO Flagship vs. Flagship 60 vs. PRO\n\n**Flagship Session Architecture:**\n1. Coaching video from Mat Fraser or staff coach (intent briefing)\n2. Intentional warm-up (mimicking session movements)\n3. Strength progressions with strength accessory work\n4. Gymnastics progressions\n5. Metcon OR monostructural conditioning (rowing, running, swimming)\n6. Accessories\n7. Optional bonus/extra workout (can add ~1 hour)\n\n**Flagship 60** removes either a strength piece or accessory piece(s) from Flagship; occasionally shortens the metcon by 25\u201333% or lightens strength percentages slightly. Never exceeds 70 minutes including warm-up and clean-up.\n\n**HWPO PRO** requires:\n- 2 sessions/day, 3\u20134 hours total\n- Top 300 Quarterfinal placement\n- Specific strength minimums (245/155 lb Snatch, 275/185 lb C&J, 365 lb Back Squat)\n- No modifications or scaling\n- Access to track, pool, specialty equipment\n- Off-Season and Comp Prep phases with track variations (Aerobic Focus track for athletes who struggle with longer metcons)\n\n**HWPO Strong 2.0:**\n- Each session: warm-up \u2192 primary lift \u2192 secondary lift \u2192 accessory work \u2192 optional metcon/conditioning\n- 60\u201375 minutes per session\n- 4\u20138 week blocks with deload every 4th week\n- Hybrid percentage + RPE progression\n\n(Sources: hwpotraining.com, thebarbellspin.com, roguefitness.com)\n\n### Representative Sample Workouts\n\n**Workout 1: HWPO Flagship \u2014 Week 2 Pressing Day (Published by Fraser, Men's Health)**\n\n*Warm-Up (3 Rounds):*\n- 15 Cal Ski Erg\n- 10/10 Half-Kneeling Single-Arm DB Press\n- 10 DB Romanian Deadlifts\n- 4 Inchworms\n\n*Strength A \u2014 Push Press:*\n- 1 \u00d7 10 @57% 1RM\n- 1 \u00d7 10 @60% 1RM\n- 2 \u00d7 8 @63% 1RM\n\n*Strength B \u2014 Strict Press:*\n- 4 \u00d7 10 @90% of 10RM\n\n*Metcon:*\n- Buy-In: Tabata Bike (8 rounds: 20s on / 10s off)\n- 5 Rounds: 8 Sandbag Cleans + 10 Burpees Over Sandbag\n- Buy-Out: 20/16 Assault Bike Calories\n\n*Accessories:*\n- 4 \u00d7 20 Assisted Strict Pull-Ups\n- 5 \u00d7 15 OH DB Triceps Extensions\n- 3 \u00d7 15 Reverse Hypers (or Back Extensions)\n\n*Bonus Work (separate session):*\n- 40 minutes Spin Bike or Run in Zone 2 (145 BPM)\n\n**Workout 2: HWPO Flagship \u2014 Typical Heavy Squat Day (Reconstructed from Review Data)**\n\n*Warm-Up:* Movement-specific activation, 2\u20133 rounds\n*Strength:* Back Squat \u2014 heavy sets (percentage-based, progressing through cycle)\n- Example: 5 \u00d7 3 @82\u201388% 1RM (building across sets)\n*Olympic Lift:* Power Clean or Snatch variation \u2014 3\u20135 working sets\n*Metcon:* 4 \u00d7 2:00 AMRAP with 1:00 rest \u2014 high-intensity work windows with mixed modality\n*Accessories:* GHD work, single-leg variations\n\n**Workout 3: HWPO \u2014 Saturday 40-Minute EMOM (Typical Long Conditioning)**\n- 40:00 EMOM alternating stations:\n  - Min 1: Row Calories\n  - Min 2: Wall Balls\n  - Min 3: KB Swings\n  - Min 4: Box Jumps\n  - (Repeat 10 rounds)\n- Built-in intensity elements in 1\u20132 stations to prevent \"cruise control\"\n\n**Workout 4: HWPO Sweat \u2014 Full Body (Published Sample)**\n- 0:00\u201312:00 \u2014 EMOM 12:\n  - 1a. Glute Bridge \u00d7 30s\n  - 1b. Side Plank Hip Touch \u00d7 20s each side\n  - 1c. Walking or Stationary Lunge \u00d7 30s\n- (Followed by AMRAP conditioning and accessory circuit \u2014 minimal equipment)\n\n**Workout 5: HWPO Strong 2.0 \u2014 Typical Session Structure**\n- Warm-up: targeted activation\n- Primary Lift: e.g., Back Squat 4 \u00d7 5 @75\u201382% (progressing week to week)\n- Secondary Lift: e.g., Romanian Deadlift 3 \u00d7 8\n- Accessory Work: 3\u20134 exercises (single-leg, core, posterior chain)\n- Optional Metcon: 8\u201312 min conditioning piece\n- *Deload week every 4th week*\n\n### Hyrox Applicability Analysis\n\n**What Transfers Well:**\n- **Rowing dominance:** HWPO programs extensive rowing volume, which directly transfers to the 1km row station in Hyrox\n- **Assault/Echo Bike work** is standard \u2014 transfers to the bike erg conditioning demands\n- **Zone 2 bonus work** (40-min spin bike/run @145 BPM) is exactly the aerobic base work Hyrox athletes need\n- **Sandbag cleans** appear in metcons \u2014 a direct Hyrox station movement\n- **Wall balls** feature in conditioning pieces\n- **Forced-break interval structure** (short AMRAPs with built-in rest) trains the ability to sustain high output across transitions, exactly like moving between Hyrox running and station segments\n- **4-week block periodization with deloads** is directly applicable to a 16-week Hyrox prep (4 mesocycles)\n- **Percentage-based strength work** keeps loading individualized and progressive\n- **Strong 2.0's structure** (primary lift + secondary lift + optional metcon in 60\u201375 min) is an excellent template for Hyrox strength days\n\n**What's Missing:**\n- **Running volume is grossly insufficient** for Hyrox \u2014 running appears occasionally in metcons and as bonus Zone 2, but a Hyrox athlete needs 8km of total race running and should be running 20\u201330+ km/week in training\n- **Olympic lifting takes up significant training time** with no Hyrox transfer (no snatches, cleans, or jerks in Hyrox)\n- **Gymnastic skills** (muscle-ups, handstand walks, etc.) consume programming space with zero Hyrox applicability\n- **Session length of ~2 hours** is problematic for time-constrained athletes; the Flagship 60 variant helps but still sacrifices running opportunities\n- **Sled push/pull** \u2014 despite being the hardest Hyrox station for many athletes \u2014 appears to be underrepresented relative to its race importance\n- **Burpee broad jumps** are not standard in HWPO programming\n- **Ski erg** is programmed but not at Hyrox-specific distances/intensities (1km race segment)\n- **Lunges** (particularly weighted walking lunges, a Hyrox station) don't appear with the specificity or volume Hyrox demands\n\n**Modification for 16-Week Hyrox Prep:**\n1. Use the **4-week block + deload structure** (4 mesocycles of 3+1)\n2. Replace all Olympic lifting with Hyrox station practice and additional running\n3. Keep the **squat, deadlift, and bench** strength progressions (excellent base for sled, lunge, and wall ball performance)\n4. Expand running from bonus work to **3\u20134 dedicated sessions/week** at varying intensities\n5. Adopt the **forced-break interval metcon format** but populate it with Hyrox movements\n6. Use the **Flagship 60 or Strong 2.0 template** as the base structure to keep sessions manageable\n\n### Key Programming Principles for AI Coach Extraction\n\n1. **Phased periodization in 4-week blocks** with programmed deload weeks \u2014 the AI must auto-schedule deloads\n2. **1RM percentage-based loading** with RPE fallback for untested athletes\n3. **Coaching video/intent briefing model** \u2014 the AI should provide intent and stimulus descriptions for every session\n4. **Forced-break interval design** to maximize intensity within work windows\n5. **Community synchronization** (everyone on the same day) improves accountability \u2014 the AI should support cohort-based training\n6. **Distinct tracks for different time budgets** (2-hour vs 60-min) \u2014 the AI needs a session-length selector that trims intelligently (remove accessories, shorten metcon, lighten percentages)\n7. **Progressive onboarding** \u2014 new athletes start with introductory weeks before full-intensity programming\n8. **Heavy emphasis on monostructural conditioning** (dedicated rowing, biking, running pieces separate from metcons)\n\n---\n\n## 3. CompTrain (Ben Bergeron)\n\n### Program Overview\n\nCompTrain is Ben Bergeron's programming platform, born from his 15 years coaching elite CrossFit Games athletes and his broader philosophy around gym programming as a retention and community-building tool. CompTrain positions itself explicitly as **gym programming** \u2014 designed for affiliate class settings rather than individual competitors.\n\n**Program tiers:**\n\n| Track | Format | Target Audience | Description |\n|-------|--------|-----------------|-------------|\n| **CompTrain Gym Programming** | 6 days/week class plans | Affiliate owners & coaches | Complete daily lesson plans with coaching notes, scaling, and class management |\n| **Benchmark testing** | Every 2 weeks | All members | 24 repeated workouts/year for progress tracking |\n\nCompTrain is available through the **Wodify Marketplace** and its own platform (comptrain.com). The programming is delivered as turnkey class plans that coaches can implement immediately.\n\n**Key positioning difference:** While PRVN and HWPO are athlete-facing (individuals subscribe), CompTrain is primarily **gym-facing** (affiliate owners subscribe, members follow in class). Bergeron emphasizes that \"programming is a retention tool\" and that a dedicated employee handles programming creation while he reviews everything. (Source: YouTube interview)\n\n### \"Intentional Intensity\" Philosophy\n\nCompTrain's programming philosophy rests on several explicitly stated principles:\n\n1. **Program for the majority, not the top 10%:** \"Programming for the top 10% of your athletes and scaling for the rest doesn't work.\" The goal is workouts that are \"doable but difficult for most\" where the class does the same work together.\n\n2. **Consistent weekly structure with variance in workouts:** A \"predictable rhythm to the schedule\" that members can build routines around, while the specific movements and loadings change.\n\n3. **Concurrent development:** \"Rather than focusing on building strength one month, endurance in another, and high-intensity capacity in the next, we build them together every week and all year round.\" This is a fundamentally different periodization approach from PRVN and HWPO's blocked phases.\n\n4. **Intentional intensity:** \"Intensity drives results, but when structured poorly and without intelligent controls around volume, it can become the barrier to progress.\" CompTrain implements this through \"movement pairings, loading, & rep schemes that fall into our programming sweet spot for sustainable power output.\"\n\n5. **No complex gymnastics:** \"We don't program complex gymnastic movements... The reality of your member's lives demands strength, endurance, and capacity. It doesn't require them to know how to walk on their hands.\"\n\n6. **Running as a cornerstone:** Programming includes \"running 2-3 times a week at varying intensities and distances\" \u2014 significantly more running emphasis than most CrossFit programming platforms.\n\n7. **Benchmark testing every 2 weeks:** 24 workouts repeated annually for progress tracking \u2014 \"progress is not just hoped for but expected and achieved.\"\n\n(Source: comptrain.com/gym-programming-principles)\n\n### Weekly Template\n\nCompTrain publishes its weekly structure explicitly:\n\n| Day | Strength Component | Conditioning Component | Duration |\n|-----|--------------------|----------------------|----------|\n| **Monday** | Press (Bench or Shoulder Press) | 8\u201318 min Conditioning | ~60 min |\n| **Tuesday** | \u2014 | 20\u201335 min Conditioning | ~60 min |\n| **Wednesday** | Pull (Deadlift / Sumo Deadlift) | 8\u201318 min Conditioning | ~60 min |\n| **Thursday** | \u2014 | 20\u201335 min Conditioning | ~60 min |\n| **Friday** | Squat (Front or Back Squat) | 8\u201318 min Conditioning | ~60 min |\n| **Saturday** | \u2014 | 20\u201335 min Team Workouts | ~60 min |\n| **Sunday** | \u2014 | Run 2\u20133 miles | ~30 min |\n\n(Source: comptrain.com/gym-programming-principles)\n\n**Key structural patterns:**\n- **3 strength days** (Mon/Wed/Fri) each paired with a shorter conditioning piece (8\u201318 min)\n- **3 conditioning-only days** (Tue/Thu/Sat) with longer workouts (20\u201335 min)\n- **Saturday is team day** \u2014 community-building format\n- **Sunday is a dedicated run** \u2014 2\u20133 miles, reinforcing running as a cornerstone\n- Strength follows a **Press \u2192 Pull \u2192 Squat** rotation across the week\n- **Benchmark workouts every 2 weeks** replace the scheduled conditioning piece\n\n### Session Structure\n\nBased on the published programming template (\"Hole in the Wall\"), a typical CompTrain session follows:\n\n| Phase | Example | Duration |\n|-------|---------|----------|\n| Whiteboard Brief | Coach explains intent, scaling, target times | 3\u20135 min |\n| Movement instruction | Tell, Show, Do, Check format | 5\u20138 min |\n| Strength piece | 3 \u00d7 8 Back Squats on 3:00 clock | 12\u201315 min |\n| Transition/Practice round | Movement rehearsal | 3\u20135 min |\n| Conditioning piece | Every 2:00 \u00d7 5 Rounds of wallballs + DB snatches | 10\u201318 min |\n| Post-workout cool down | Accessory/mobility/chat | 8\u201310 min |\n\n**Coaching integration:** CompTrain provides detailed \"Look For\" coaching cues (e.g., \"Flat feet \u2014 look for athletes gripping the ground with the foot throughout the rep\") and specific time management guidance for class flow.\n\n### Strength Programming Approach\n\nCompTrain's strength work follows a notable pattern visible across months of published programming:\n\n**Press variations (Monday):**\n- Bench Press: Max Reps @80%, @90%, Heavy Set of 20, or climbing sets\n- Strict Press: Max Reps, sets within 12:00 windows, 3:00 \u00d7 3 sets\n\n**Pull variations (Wednesday):**\n- Deadlift: Max Reps, 12:00 windows, climbing sets\n- Sumo Deadlift: Alternates with conventional, 5-second negatives, 5\u20137 climbing sets\n\n**Squat variations (Friday):**\n- Back Squat: Build to Heavy Single, Max Reps @85\u201390%, add 10# from last attempt\n- Front Squat: Max Reps @80\u201390%, 12:00 windows\n\nThe **\"Add 10# From Last Attempt\"** notation (visible in the May 10 Back Squat entry referencing 2/26/24) reveals CompTrain's long-term progressive overload tracking \u2014 the same test is repeated months later with explicit load increases.\n\n### Representative Sample Workouts\n\n**Workout 1: Strength + Conditioning Monday \u2014 \"Hole in the Wall\"**\n- *Strength:* On the 3:00 \u00d7 3 Sets: 8 Back Squats \u2014 Start at 60% and build\n- *Conditioning:* Every 2:00 \u00d7 5 Rounds: 25 Wall Balls (20/14 lb) + Max DB Snatches (50/35 lb)\n- *Score:* Total DB Snatches\n- *Scaling:* Reduce wallball reps/loading/target height as needed\n- *Target pacing:* Wall balls in :60 or less, DB snatches for ~:45\n\n**Workout 2: Long Conditioning Tuesday \u2014 \"Run Up\"**\n- 5 Rounds For Time:\n  -

This is the single most important element for Hyrox transfer. The \"Run Up\" workout alone includes 4km of running with bodyweight movements between \u2014 nearly identical to Hyrox's alternating run/station format.\n\n2. **Concurrent development model** matches Hyrox demands. Hyrox athletes need strength, endurance, and capacity simultaneously \u2014 CompTrain builds all three every week, all year. This avoids the \"peaked for strength but untrained aerobically\" trap.\n\n3. **Sustainable intensity philosophy** (\"build up, not burn out\") aligns perfectly with Hyrox training, which requires high training volume without overtraining.\n\n4. **No complex gymnastics** removes wasted training time. CompTrain already self-selects away from muscle-ups, handstand walks, and other CrossFit-specific skills with zero Hyrox transfer.\n\n5. **20\u201335 minute conditioning pieces** (Tue/Thu/Sat) are in the right duration range for simulating portions of a Hyrox race.\n\n6. **Team workout Saturdays** build pacing awareness and competitive energy \u2014 useful for Hyrox Doubles and race-day intensity.\n\n7. **Benchmark testing every 2 weeks** provides the regular performance data an AI coach needs to adjust training loads.\n\n8. **Deadlift, squat, and press strength progressions** build the base needed for sled push/pull, lunges, and wall balls.\n\n9. **Wall balls are frequently programmed** (e.g., 25 reps in \"Hole in the Wall,\" \"Nancy\" features overhead squats which share movement patterns).\n\n10. **Rowing and Bike Erg** are standard conditioning tools (e.g., \"Total Whine\" with alternating row/bike intervals).\n\n**Weaknesses \u2014 What's Missing:**\n\n1. **Sled push/pull** is not a standard CompTrain movement \u2014 this is the single biggest gap given it's the most challenging Hyrox station for most athletes.\n\n2. **Burpee broad jumps** are absent (CompTrain programs burpees, but not the broad jump variation specific to Hyrox).\n\n3. **Ski erg** appears occasionally but is not programmed at race-specific distances (1km).\n\n4. **Weighted walking lunges** at Hyrox-specific loads and distances are not a standard feature.\n\n5. **Farmer carries** are not regularly programmed in the main class (may appear in accessories).\n\n6. **Running is 2\u20133\u00d7/week, but Hyrox athletes likely need 4\u20135\u00d7/week** at 20\u201330+ km total weekly volume. The Sunday 2\u20133 mile run is a good start but insufficient.\n\n7. **Power cleans and overhead squats** consume training time with limited Hyrox transfer beyond general fitness.\n\n8. **Time-domain distribution** may skew shorter than ideal \u2014 many conditioning pieces are 8\u201318 min, but Hyrox race duration is 60\u201390+ min. More 30\u201345 min pieces would help.\n\n**Modification for 16-Week Hyrox Prep:**\n1. **Keep the Monday/Wednesday/Friday strength + conditioning structure** \u2014 it's excellent\n2. **Replace Tuesday/Thursday conditioning with Hyrox-specific sessions:** e.g., \"Hyrox simulation\" workouts with 1km run + station, repeated 4\u00d7 with different stations\n3. **Increase Sunday run to 5\u20138km** and add a second dedicated run on Tuesday or Thursday\n4. **Add sled work 2\u00d7/week** (push and pull at Hyrox race loads)\n5. **Program Hyrox station practice as the conditioning pieces:** wall balls \u00d7100, burpee broad jumps \u00d780m, farmer carry \u00d7200m, lunges \u00d7200m\n6. **Use benchmark workouts as Hyrox-specific tests:** e.g., timed 1km row, timed 200m sled push, timed 100 wall balls\n7. **Retain the concurrent development philosophy** \u2014 never drop strength entirely, but shift from max-strength testing to strength-endurance (higher reps, moderate load)\n\n### Key Programming Principles for AI Coach Extraction\n\n1. **Concurrent development:** Build strength, endurance, and capacity every week \u2014 never enter a \"strength-only\" or \"endurance-only\" phase\n2. **Running as a non-negotiable cornerstone** at 2\u20133\u00d7/week minimum \u2014 the AI must include running in every weekly plan\n3. **Predictable weekly structure with movement variance** \u2014 athletes should know \"Monday is strength + conditioning\" but the specific movements change\n4. **\"Intentional intensity\" controls:** Movement pairings, loading, and rep schemes that create sustainable power output \u2014 the AI should calculate and cap total session volume/intensity\n5. **Benchmark testing cadence:** Repeat standardized tests every 2 weeks to track progress \u2014 the AI needs a testing protocol library\n6. **Program for the median athlete, not the top 10%** \u2014 the AI should default to accessible movements and scale up, not the reverse\n7. **Team/partner formats** weekly for community and pacing practice\n8. **Class-duration constraint** (~60 min) forces efficient session design \u2014 the AI should respect time budgets\n9. **\"Add weight from last attempt\" progressive overload tracking** \u2014 the AI must store and reference historical performance data\n10. **Detailed coaching cues per movement** (\"Look For\" format) \u2014 the AI should provide real-time technique reminders\n\n---\n\n## Cross-Program Comparative Summary\n\n| Dimension | PRVN | HWPO | CompTrain |\n|-----------|------|------|-----------|\n| **Primary

|\n\n### Synthesis: Optimal AI Coach Design Principles\n\nDrawing from all three programs, an AI coaching system for Hyrox preparation should:\n\n1. **Use HWPO's 4-week block periodization with deloads** (3 on / 1 deload) within a 16-week macro\n2. **Adopt CompTrain's concurrent development philosophy** \u2014 never sacrifice running or endurance for a \"strength phase\"\n3. **Follow PRVN's 60-minute session architecture** with time-blocked phases (warm-up \u2192 primer \u2192 main work \u2192 conditioning \u2192 mobility)\n4. **Program running 3\u20134\u00d7/week minimum** (borrowing CompTrain's cornerstone principle and expanding it)\n5. **Use HWPO's percentage-based loading with RPE fallback** for all strength work\n6. **Implement PRVN's multi-level scaling** (3 tiers per workout) to serve athletes from beginner to advanced\n7. **Design conditioning pieces in HWPO's forced-break interval format** but populate them with Hyrox-specific movements\n8. **Test benchmarks every 2 weeks** (CompTrain model) using Hyrox-specific standards (1km row time, 200m sled push time, 100 wall balls time, 8km run time)\n9. **Provide intent briefings** for every session (HWPO coaching video model translated to text/AI guidance)\n10. **Exclude non-transferable movements** (Olympic lifts, complex gymnastics, handstand walks) in favor of Hyrox station work \u2014 following CompTrain's pragmatic movement selection philosophy\n\nThis synthesized approach captures the periodization intelligence of HWPO, the session structure and scalability of PRVN, and the sustainable conditioning philosophy and running emphasis of CompTrain \u2014 creating a purpose-built Hyrox preparation system.",
