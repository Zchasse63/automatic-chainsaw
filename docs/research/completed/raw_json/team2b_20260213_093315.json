          "snippet": "This workout is designed for anyone. It's a CrossFit-inspired metabolic-conditioning circuit. There's a push, a pull, and a cardio element. As soon as your push gets uncomfortable, move to the pull. When the pull becomes an issue, move to the jump rope. Jumping rope will make you tired and challenge your forearms just enough to make the other two movements a bit harder.\n\n\u2026\n\nYou'll begin with shoulder to overhead (STO). After you complete 15 reps, you'll go directly to pull-ups (PU) and do 15 reps. After you're done with pull-ups, you'll do 30 double-unders (DU).When you're done with the DUs, return to STO and do 12 reps. Then you'll do 12 reps of PUs and another 30 reps of DUs. You'll keep repeating that pattern. The STO and PUs will go down by three reps each set, while the double-unders remain constant at 30 reps.",

I'm  like,  \"And  there  the \n\n{ts:306} odds  were  good.\" \n >> But  the  the  best  part  was  like  during\n{ts:309} \n that  conversation,  he's  like,  \"Wait,  how \n\n{ts:311} do  I  know  that  I've  been  denied?\"  And \n you're  like, \"You  got  an  email.\"\n{ts:313} \n >> Yeah. \n\n{ts:314} >> And  then  he  looked  and  he  found,  I  don't \n have  anything.  I  don't  have  anything.  He\n{ts:317} \n goes,  \"Oh,  right  here.\" \n\n{ts:320} >> Bro  needs  a  email. \n >> He  needs  an  email  system.\n{ts:322} \n >> He  needs  some  help. \n\n{ts:323} >> Yeah.  What  uh  what  juice  you  got  going \n on  there?\n{ts:326} \n >> Just  some  more  lemonade.  I  juiced  some \n\n{ts:328} more  lemons  yesterday.  So,  are  you \n counting  this  towards  your  water  for\n{ts:331} \n your  New  Year's  resolution? \n\n{ts:332} >> Sure, \n >> for  sure.  Right.  Like  we  were  talking\n{ts:334} \n about  that  yesterday  that  um \n\n{ts:336} >> is  that  just  lemon  and  water? \n >> Just  Well,  I  mean  there's  some  stevia  in\n{ts:339} \n it  sweetener. \n\n{ts:340} >> Man,  I  don't  think  you  count  that  as \n water\n{ts:341} \n >> really. \n\n{ts:342} >> As  soon  as  you  sweeten  it,  I  feel  like \n you  there's  no  water.\n{ts:346} \n >> I  count  fresca. \n\n{ts:347} >> People  still  like  frescas. \n >> Yeah.\n{ts:349} \n >> People  still  get  on  like  Rich  never \n\n{ts:351} drinks  water.  I  drink  at  least  a  gallon \n of  Spin  Drift  a  day.  There's  no\n{ts:355} \n sweetener  in  it.  Well,  I  will  say \n\n{ts:357} >> that's  the  most  water  pure  thing  I \n think.\n{ts:359} \n >> Yeah.  Yeah,  for  sure.  Oh,  that's \n\n{ts:360} definitely  water.  I  have  Maddie  to  back \n me  up.  Like  me  and  Sam  had  this  argument\n{ts:364} \n over  the  summer.  I  was  just  like  chain \n\n{ts:367} smoking  the  frescas  all  day.

And  so  I  was  drinking  I'm  drinking \n\n{ts:375} frescas.  Like  I  drank  probably  10  or  12. \n >> Uh  cuz  I  was  trying  to  hydrate.  And  Sam\n{ts:380} \n goes  that  you  know  that  doesn't  really \n\n{ts:382} count.  I  go, \"Well,  sure  it  does.\"  And  I \n asked  Maddie,  I  said,  \"My  does  this\n{ts:384} \n count  as  water?\"  She's  like  maybe  not \n\n{ts:386} water  but  a  hydrate  a  hydrating  fluid \n definitely  not  dehydrating  me  it's\n{ts:391} \n definitely  helping  me  hydrate  and  in  my \n\n{ts:393} mind \n >> sweetener  bras\n{ts:395} \n >> I  think  it's  art  sorry  what's  the \n\n{ts:397} artificial  sweetener \n >> sucralose  or  aspartame  or  whatever  just\n{ts:400} \n like \n\n{ts:401} >> aspartame  for  sure \n >> aspartame\n{ts:402} \n >> yeah  but  you  I  mean  you  know  you  have  to \n\n{ts:404} drink  I  think  it's  like  130  cans  of  soda \n a  day  to  get  into  the\n{ts:408} \n >> cancer \n\n{ts:409} >> the  deadly  limit  for  I  think  the  lower \n end  of  the  deadly  limit  for  for  like  a\n{ts:415} \n normal  person's  body,  like  a  200lb \n\n{ts:417} person.

You  would  drown  in  You \n\n{ts:424} would  drown  in  fluid  before  you  Is  that \n what  it  is?\n{ts:426} \n >> I  think  so.  Right. \n\n{ts:427} >> Yeah.  You  would  drown  in  the  fluid \n before  you  would  die  from  the  aspartame.\n{ts:430} \n Like \n\n{ts:430} >> be  a  bad  day. \n >> Yeah.\n{ts:432} \n >> You'd  be  a  statistic. \n\n{ts:433} >> Mhm. \n >> Like  one  of  one  drown  in  Fresa.\n{ts:438} \n >> We  thought  this  was \n\n{ts:439} >> caffeine  in  Fresa. \n >> Yeah.

Trying  to  kill  myself\n{ts:449} \n with  aspartame. \n\n{ts:452} >> And  it's  just  me  like  choking  because \n I'm  drowning  in  fresca.  I  have  fresca\n{ts:457} \n filling  up  every  orifice  of  the  inside \n\n{ts:460} of  my  body.

I  invited \n him.\n{ts:490} \n >> We'll  say  what  the  Say  what  the \n\n{ts:491} challenge  is.  It  is  a \n >> 24hour  challenge  here  at  the  barn.  Um,\n{ts:496} \n inner  circle  challenge,  I  guess.  Mayhem \n\n{ts:498} challenge. \n twoerson  teams.  We  have  sixish  miles  of\n{ts:504} \n trails,  six  point,  whatever  that  we \n\n{ts:507} usually  do  the  mountain  bikes,  rate,  the \n mountain  bike  race  on.  Um,  we're  going\n{ts:511} \n to  change  it  up.  We're  going  to  do  the \n\n{ts:512} mountain  bike  race  later  in  the  spring. \n But  we  are  going  to  do  uh  by  popular\n{ts:517} \n demand  because  all  we  have  is  runners \n\n{ts:518} around  here  now.  Apparently,  nobody  does \n CrossFit  anymore.  They  just  run.  We're\n{ts:522} \n going  to  do  a  partner  relay  for  24 \n\n{ts:525} hours.  You've  got  three  miles  this  way. \n One  partner  will  do  that.  Partner  two\n{ts:531} \n will  then  do  that  after  you  meet  at  the \n\n{ts:533} barn.  Barn  will  be  the  hub.  And  then \n partner  one  will  run  the  other  side,\n{ts:537} \n come  back  here.  Partner  two  will  run  the \n\n{ts:539} other  side,  come  back  here. \n >> We're  going  to  do  that  for  24  hours.\n{ts:543} \n >> Hey, \n\n{ts:543} >> so  you  won't  go  like \n you  just  go  around  the  base  of  the\n{ts:547} \n mountain  on  that  side. \n\n{ts:548} >> No,  no,  you're  going \n >> doing  the  whole  thing,  man.\n{ts:549} \n >> Okay. \n\n{ts:550} >> About  300ish,  350  ft  of  elevation  change \n within  that  three  miles.  So  it's  be  a\n{ts:556} \n lot  of  hiking. \n\n{ts:556} >> I'm  going  go  and  call  my  shot  now.  Me \n and  Dre  are  going  to  win.\n{ts:560} \n >> Okay, \n\n{ts:560} >> that's  going  to  age  well. \n >> Cool  for  you.\n{ts:562} \n >> Thank  you. \n\n{ts:564} >> Um,  good. \n >> We  just  got  a  message  in  our  man.\n{ts:566} \n >> Foster  and  Locker,  I  think,  are  doing  it \n\n{ts:567} together. \n >> Oh,  they'll  cream  you  guys.\n{ts:570} \n >> They  will. \n\n{ts:571} >> Scott,  are  you  just  going  to  shadow \n somebody  or  you  going to  do  it  your  own?\n{ts:574} \n >> No. \n\n{ts:574} >> And  take  turns. \n >> I  thought  you  guys  were  a  team.\n{ts:577} \n >> It  was  me  and  Malola.  We  got  to  be  me \n\n{ts:579} and  Scott.  Scott  will  basically  run  it \n with  me,  right?\n{ts:582} \n >> Yeah.  I  may  I  may  not  actually \n\n{ts:584} participate  so  I  can  better  cover  it. \n >> Yeah.  Um,\n{ts:587} \n >> but  you  could  run  every  time  I  run. \n\n{ts:589} >> Yeah,  I  probably  will  put  I'll  probably \n put  in  a  good  amount  of  miles.\n{ts:593} \n >> Yeah,  I  can  wear  the  Meta  sunglasses \n\n{ts:594} some  for  some,  too. \n >> I  bought  some  Meta  sunglasses.\n{ts:597} \n >> Yeah,  I  think  Oakley  ones.  I  wish  they \n\n{ts:600} made  a  more \n less  feminine  version  of  the  like\n{ts:605} \n hangout  ones.  I  had  to  buy  the  like, \n\n{ts:608} >> you  know,  athletic \n >> bikey  looking\n{ts:611} \n >> ones \n\n{ts:612} >> cuz  the  the  I  wish  they'd  put  like  the \n whole  Brooks  make  the  whole  Brooks  or\n{ts:617} \n something  into  some  meta  glasses  cuz  the \n\n{ts:618} other  ones  Benz  are  okay,  but  I  still \n look  like\n{ts:622} \n >> what'  you  say  I  looked  like? \n\n{ts:623} >> Clark. \n >> Clark  Kemp.\n{ts:624} \n >> No,  not  even  that. \n\n{ts:626} >> It  was  They  were  like  a  little  bit  like \n 70s\n{ts:629} \n >> too  dorky. \n\n{ts:631} >> Yeah,  I  can. \n >> You  have  them  with  you?  Oh,  okay.  Yeah,\n{ts:632} \n I  see  them.  Is  it  like  we  thought  like \n\n{ts:635} you  can  voice  activate  the  the  record? \n >> I  don't  think  Oh,  I  don't  know.  You\n{ts:639} \n >> Oh,  those  are  just  classic.  Yeah,  that's \n\n{ts:640} fine. \n >> Yeah,  but  they're  not.\n{ts:642} \n >> I  like  Ben's  videos  in  them.  They're \n\n{ts:643} pretty  cool. \n >> No,  they  look  awesome.  That's  why  I  got\n{ts:645} \n them.  You  know,  Ben,  who  cares?  This  is \n\n{ts:647} our  staterun  media. \n >> Is  that  what  you're  shooting  all  the\n{ts:649} \n >> So,  everybody  can  see  what  I  see  on  the \n\n{ts:651} podcast. \n >> Oh,  yeah.  You're  dorky  as  hell.\n{ts:653} \n >> You  know,  the  this  this  bar  needs  to  be \n\n{ts:655} straight  across  and  it  be  okay. \n >> That's  not  your  style  of  sunglasses.\n{ts:657} \n >> Hold  on.  I'll  wear  them. \n\n{ts:659} >> Are  you  filming? \n >> Glasses.\n{ts:661} \n >> Huh? \n\n{ts:662} It's  green.  The  light  is  flashing  green. \n Is  that  okay?\n{ts:665} \n >> Yeah.  Yeah. \n\n{ts:666} >> Hold  it.  Oh. \n >> Whoa.\n{ts:669} \n >> So  now,  can  you  tell  that  it's \n\n{ts:670} recording? \n >> Uh,  I  just  heard.\n{ts:673} \n >> Wait.  There's  no  like  Okay. \n\n{ts:675} >> Okay.  Um,  can  I  listen  to  music  on  these \n two?\n{ts:677} \n >> Yeah. \n\n{ts:678} >> Dang.  Those  are  cool. \n >> Yeah.  I'm  going  to  I  got  an  idea.\n{ts:681} \n >> How  much  are  those \n\n{ts:682} >> for  one  of  the  events  we're  doing? \n >> I  have  no  idea.\n{ts:685} \n >> I  don't  really  need  them,  but  they're \n\n{ts:686} cool.  Okay.  So,  what  else?  So,  they \n record  video.\n{ts:688} \n >> Can  you  see  what  I'm  seeing? \n\n{ts:690} >> No. \n >> No.  And  then  then  what  else,\n{ts:693} \n Ben? \n\n{ts:694} >> Uh,  sorry.  What'  you  ask? \n >> Like  what  else?  So  they  record  video.\n{ts:696} \n >> Rory  wants  like  a  heads  up  display  like \n\n{ts:698} an  Iron  Man.  He  thinks  that  you  can  like \n >> I  thought  the  Oakley  ones  like  talk  to\n{ts:701} \n your  garment  stuff. \n\n{ts:703} >> So \n >> type\n{ts:705} \n >> I  I  ran  in  them  for  an  hour \n\n{ts:707} >> and  I  didn't  even  do  anything,  but  it \n showed  up  on  my  phone  that  I  ran  for  an\n{ts:712} \n hour  in  them. \n\n{ts:713} >> Did  it  say  your  time,  your \n >> like  on  meta?  I  don't  know.\n{ts:716} \n >> Oh, \n\n{ts:717} >> but  there's  no  heads  up  display  like  you \n can't  see  anything.  No,  you  can't  see.\n{ts:721} \n Now  that  I  see  it,  I  can  see  a  a  white \n\n{ts:723} light  in  the  corner  of  mine.  It's  really \n messing  with  me.\n{ts:725} \n >> Yeah.  So,  like  when  it's  record  when \n\n{ts:726} you're  done  recording,  it  goes  to  the \n app,  the  meta  app,  and  then  that's  where\n{ts:731} \n everything  populates.  Picture,  video. \n\n{ts:733} But  you  can  also  I  like  it  because  you \n can  listen  to  podcast  or  like  music.\n{ts:737} \n >> But  what's  cool  is  you  can  have  a \n\n{ts:738} conversation  with  somebody  and  it  just \n is  normal.\n{ts:740} \n >> So,  for  that  Iron  Man,  you're  not \n\n{ts:743} allowed  to  have  headphones. \n >> Game  changer.\n{ts:745} \n >> Game  changer.  Good  call. \n\n{ts:747} >> Battery  dies  really  fast  though.  or  I \n don't  have  headphones  if  you're  filming\n{ts:749} \n or  when  you're  listening  to  music. \n\n{ts:751} >> I  don't  know.  Probably  just  dies  fast  to \n me  cuz  I  record  with  it.\n{ts:754} \n >> Some  of  it  has  to  do  with  that,  but  then \n\n{ts:755} I  think  they  just \n >> Another  thing  I  like  is  they they  turn\n{ts:759} \n into  transition  like  there's  sunglasses \n\n{ts:761} like  I  like  that  style  as  a  sunglass. \n >> Yeah.\n{ts:763} \n >> And  uh  I  think  I  don't  know  but  I  think \n\n{ts:766} they're  blue  light  blocking  too.  You \n think?\n{ts:768} \n >> Cuz  Yeah,  cuz  they  have  like  a  little \n\n{ts:769} greenish  tint  to  them  at  night.  Like  a \n little  like  yellowy.\n{ts:771} \n >> These  things  are  really  dirty  but \n\n{ts:773} >> Yeah.  Oh  yeah. \n I'm  glad  you  have  that  case.  been\n{ts:776} \n washing  them  with  bacon  grease. \n\n{ts:778} >> Well,  it  doesn't  help  that  I'm  staring \n into  this  light  either.\n{ts:781} \n >> Yeah. \n\n{ts:782} >> But  did  you  say  they  do  transition  or \n they  don't?\n{ts:784} \n >> They  do.  Yeah. \n\n{ts:785} >> Oh,  that's  cool. \n >> Why  are  they  not?\n{ts:787} \n >> Because  you're  not  in  the  sunlight. \n\n{ts:788} >> You  got  some  trans  glasses.  That's \n great.\n{ts:790} \n >> Yeah. \n\n{ts:791} >> Good  for  you. \n >> Yeah.\n{ts:793} \n >> I  think  they're  kind  of  cool,  man. \n\n{ts:795} >> I  don't  I  just \n >> I  get  it.  That's  not  like  your  style.\n{ts:797} \n >> Not  my  style,  right? \n\n{ts:798} >> I  mean,  and  I  don't  think  they're  more \n than  if  you  just  went  out  and  bought\n{ts:801} \n that  style  of  Ray-B  band. \n\n{ts:802} >> They're  really  not.  I  I  mean  Oakley  even \n the  same  maybe  a  hundred  bucks  more  than\n{ts:806} \n normal  I  think. \n\n{ts:807} >> Yeah. \n >> But  nothing  insane.\n{ts:809} \n >> I  think  it'd  be  cool  if  you  wore  those \n\n{ts:811} for  like  a  round  of  a  workout  cuz  you \n know  you  always  hear  people  say  like  I\n{ts:814} \n wonder  what  it's  like  to  feel  like  Rich \n\n{ts:816} Froing.  Yeah. \n >> You  know  like  on  round  nine  you  throw\n{ts:818} \n them  on.  I  wonder  if  you  could  like \n\n{ts:820} what's  that  app  where  you  can  get  like \n shout  outs  on\n{ts:823} \n >> Oh,  uh,  Cameo  or \n\n{ts:825} >> Cameo  like  like  someone's  like  someone \n get  an  app  like  that  where  I  want  Rich\n{ts:829} \n to  do  I  wanted  to  see  what  it's  like  to \n\n{ts:830} do  225  Isabelle  in  these  as  Rich  Froing \n >> back  in  the  day  maybe.\n{ts:836} \n >> Like  I  want  to  be  able  to  do  20  unbroken \n\n{ts:838} ring  muscle-ups.  Like  what  would  that \n feel  if  I  was  riching  pay  him  100  bucks\n{ts:840} \n to  do  it? \n\n{ts:842} >> There  we  go.  New  business. \n >> That  would  be  cool.\n{ts:844} \n >> I  guess  I  just  still  don't  understand \n\n{ts:846} like  why  are  they  metagasset \n too?  That's  the  whole  thing.  It's  AI.\n{ts:850} \n You  can  talk  to  it.  Uh,  it  records  3 \n\n{ts:852} minutes  at  time. \n >> Oh,  okay.\n{ts:853} \n >> I  guess  so  you  don't  forget  about  it. \n\n{ts:854} >> You  have  to  keep  hitting  record. \n >> Yeah.  Um,\n{ts:856} \n >> okay.  So,  there's  AI. \n\n{ts:857} >> Yeah,  there's  AI  on  them.  So,  like  you \n can  ask  it  what  you're  looking  at  or\n{ts:859} \n like \n\n{ts:860} >> like  ask  it  like  what's  the  altitude \n here?  You  know,  just  like  random  stuff.\n{ts:864} \n >> It'll  speak  to  you  like  you're  like, \n\n{ts:866} >> you  know,  what  is  that  ammo  over  there? \n >> Do  I  say,  \"Hey,  Meta,  do  I  what  do  I  do\n{ts:869} \n >> now?\"  You  talk  to  her.  She's  listening. \n\n{ts:870} >> Oh, \n >> yeah.\n{ts:873} \n >> Like  you  can  say  you  can  say  text \n\n{ts:875} somebody  or  call  somebody. \n >> Is  it  blinking?\n{ts:877} \n >> Yeah.  Okay.  Hey,  Meta.  What's  the \n\n{ts:880} altitude  here? \n >> She  might  ask  you  where  you're  at.\n{ts:885} \n She  doesn't  like  my  voice. \n\n{ts:886} >> Nope. \n >> Hey,  Meta.  Hey,  girl.  Hey.\n{ts:889} \n >> She  just  go  away. \n\n{ts:889} >> Yeah.  Go  away. \n >> I  think  you  messed  it  up  because  you\n{ts:891} \n said  and  meta  and  you  start  talking  to \n\n{ts:894} >> It's  like  my  kids  when  they  try  to  yell \n at  Siri.\n{ts:896} \n >> Yeah. \n\n{ts:896} >> Like,  hey  Siri.  And  they  start  talking \n and  then  Siri  starts  talking  to  say\n{ts:899} \n Yeah.  Oh,  she's  talking. \n\n{ts:902} >> But  the  resp \n yelling.\n{ts:905} \n >> Oh,  dude.  Did  I  make  that  up?  that \n\n{ts:907} they're  that  Whoa. \n >> Whoa.  Did  you  start  playing  music  or  did\n{ts:912} \n I  do  that? \n\n{ts:912} >> Oh,  no.  You  did  that.  Oh,  yeah.  So,  if \n you  tap  the  side  once,  it  plays  whatever\n{ts:916} \n you're  listening  to. \n\n{ts:917} >> Oh,  that's \n >> What  were  you  listening  to?\n{ts:919} \n >> I  I  don't  know.  It  just  came  It  was  just \n\n{ts:920} like  a \n >> He's  listening  to  Please  Don't  Go  by\n{ts:922} \n Wyatt  Flores  now. \n\n{ts:924} >> All  right.  This  is  going  to  be  the  worst \n podcast  ever.  That's  just  like  nerding\n{ts:928} \n out.  This  is  the  problem  with \n\n{ts:930} technology. \n >> The  listening  to  it  would  be  pretty\n{ts:933} \n boring. \n\n{ts:934} >> Wow.  Okay.  So,  I  I  did  think  that  they  I \n thought  for  mountain  biking,  you  could\n{ts:937} \n say  cuz  with  with  even  with  uh  GoPros \n\n{ts:940} now,  you  can  tell  it  voice  activate  to \n record.\n{ts:942} \n >> I  don't  know.  I've  been  using  that  DJI. \n\n{ts:943} Did  you  go  through  any  of  that  footage \n yet?\n{ts:945} \n >> Uh  yeah. \n\n{ts:946} >> Is  there  anything  useful  on  there? \n >> Yeah,  I  think  so.\n{ts:948} \n >> Oh,  really? \n\n{ts:949} >> It's  probably  our  best  recorded  solo \n video  without  any  media  guys  with  the\n{ts:953} \n DJI  and  well,  both  DJIs,  the  Osmo  and \n\n{ts:956} then  the  handhel  or  the  kind  of  GoPro \n looking  thing\n{ts:960} \n >> and  we  didn't  see  one  animal. \n\n{ts:961} >> I  know. \n >> So,  but\n{ts:965} \n when  Scott  was  dying,  right? \n\n{ts:967} >> No,  Scott  just  didn't  want  to  go. \n >> No,  you  had  something.  What  did  you\n{ts:970} \n have? \n\n{ts:970} >> Uh,  I  had  family  in  town. \n >> That  was  it.  You  had  your  in-laws  in\n{ts:973} \n town. \n\n{ts:974} >> You  didn't  miss  anything. \n >> Um,  all right.  Classic.  Programming's\n{ts:979} \n done. \n\n{ts:979} >> Programming  is  done. \n >> You  haven't  seen  it  yet?\n{ts:982} \n >> I  have  not. \n\n{ts:983} >> No. \n >> I'm  going  to  have  to,  though,  so  I  can\n{ts:986} \n fill  out  our  fancy \n\n{ts:987} >> Oh,  yeah.  We  got  to  fill  out  our \n spreadsheet.  Did  you  see\n{ts:989} \n >> programming  analysis?  Spreadsheet. \n\n{ts:990} >> I  did.  I  I  was \n >> They  sent  us  a  programming  analysis.  who\n{ts:994} \n >> I  think  it's  actually  pretty  cool. \n\n{ts:995} >> HQ. \n >> It's  a  good  It's  a  good  step.\n{ts:997} \n >> I  think  it's  a  good  coaches  tool  like \n\n{ts:1000} for  Malolo.  I  was  like,  man,  this  would \n be  like  what  is\n{ts:1003} \n >> it's  like  um  there's  a  movement \n\n{ts:1006} checklist.  There's  a  couplet,  triplet, \n chipper  checklist.  There's\n{ts:1011} \n >> it  basically  like  gives  you  a  visual \n\n{ts:1012} representation  via  spreadsheet  of  like \n how  wellrounded  your  programming  is,  I\n{ts:1015} \n suppose  you  could  say.  Yeah.  So  you  put \n\n{ts:1017} your  stuff  in  like  according  to  like  the \n metrics  and  then  it'll  be  like  maybe\n{ts:1020} \n you're  missing  this  time  zone  or  you're \n\n{ts:1023} heavy  on  these  movements  or  what? \n >> But  it'll  do  that  as  you  put  it  in.\n{ts:1026} \n >> Then  that's  like  what  the  outcome  should \n\n{ts:1027} be. \n >> I  thought  I  thought  they  just  review  it.\n{ts:1029} \n >> Oh,  you're  saying \n\n{ts:1030} >> they  review  it,  but  I  think  this  I  think \n that  it  gives  it  it  gives  them  a  more\n{ts:1033} \n systematic  way  to  do  it  because  they've \n\n{ts:1035} got  what  like \n >> judging  it.  Is  it  Brian  friend  judging\n{ts:1037} \n it  like  last  year? \n\n{ts:1039} >> It  was  a  joke.  Everybody, \n >> all  I  can  picture  is\n{ts:1042} \n >> me  and  Locker  were  programming  compete \n\n{ts:1043} this  morning  and  I  was  trying  to  throw \n out  your  guys'  terms.  He  wanted  to  do\n{ts:1047} \n >> we  had  a  biker  gone.  We  had  a  biker  gone \n\n{ts:1050} one  day  and  then  he  wanted  a \n >> echo  bike  and  then  the  day  in  between\n{ts:1053} \n there  was  a  lot  of  and  I  was  like,  \"Oh, \n\n{ts:1055} it's  too  cyclical.\" \n >> You  know,  he  did  not  think  it  was  as\n{ts:1060} \n funny  as  I  did. \n\n{ts:1061} >> All  I  can  picture  is  we  put  the \n programming  and  did  the  spreadsheet  and\n{ts:1065} \n someone  and  it  says  whatever  and  someone \n\n{ts:1066} at  CrossFit,  but  it's  from  the  parks  and \n wreck  thing  and  goes,  I  know  more  than\n{ts:1070} \n you  and  walks  out. \n\n{ts:1072} >> Yeah.  Oh,  yeah. \n >> Um,  Watkins  stepped  in  in  your  place\n{ts:1075} \n this  morning  for  the  first  3  or  4 \n\n{ts:1077} minutes. \n >> Did  he?\n{ts:1078} \n >> Yeah.  So,  you  know  how  we  had  on  that \n\n{ts:1080} other  whiteboard?  So,  we're  kind  of \n moving  offices  around  and  repurposing\n{ts:1084} \n some  spaces.  So,  we've  got  the  new \n\n{ts:1087} conference  room  and  it's  whiteboards \n everywhere,  which  is  awesome  because  I\n{ts:1089} \n I'm  a  whiteboard  guy.  I  can't  look  at \n\n{ts:1092} like  these  guys  love \n >> spreadsheets.\n{ts:1094} \n >> Spreadsheets.  They  love  spreadsheets.  I \n\n{ts:1096} like  to  write  it  out.  Look  at  what  we \n did  the  week  before.  So,  we'll  leave  up\n{ts:1099} \n the  week  prior  to  us  compete  and  then \n\n{ts:1102} we'll  start  working  a  week  or  two  the \n next  week  and  so  I  can  look  back  and\n{ts:1106} \n forth.  Well,  Watkins  and  Bird  put  up  the \n\n{ts:1109} TV  in  there  and  it  says  do  not  erase \n with  my  name  underneath  it.  They  took  a\n{ts:1114} \n picture,  but  then  they  put  the  TV  up  and \n\n{ts:1117} they  put  the  the  bracket. \n >> Yeah.\n{ts:1121} \n >> They  didn't  even  erase  behind  the \n\n{ts:1123} bracket  so  it's  there  permanently. \n They  said,  \"Well,  you  said  don't  erase\n{ts:1128} \n it.\" \n\n{ts:1131} >> So,  in  like  hundreds  of  years  when  that \n building  gets  blown  down  and  you  know,\n{ts:1134} \n >> there's  going to  be  like  a  wall  ball \n\n{ts:1135} bench  press  written  on  the  wall. \n >> Oh,  what  are  these  hieroglyphics?\n{ts:1139} \n >> Yeah. \n\n{ts:1140} >> Behind  this.  So,  I  It  was  like \n >> morons.\n{ts:1144} \n >> Oh  my  gosh.  That's  good. \n\n{ts:1146} >> So,  but  yep, \n >> Lockin  stepped  in.\n{ts:1149} \n >> Nice. \n\n{ts:1149} >> Just  completely  I  don't  think  he  he  was \n just  like\n{ts:1151} \n >> no  idea.  Well,  this  is  coming  from  the \n\n{ts:1154} guy  who  says  the  marathon  at  the  end  of \n an  Iron  Man  isn't  that  hard.\n{ts:1156} \n >> No.  Easiest  part.  Yeah.  The  marathon. \n\n{ts:1159} >> Easiest  part.  He  says  he  doesn't  think \n he's  going  to  He  said  he  doesn't  know  if\n{ts:1162} \n he's  going to  do  the  marathon.  He's \n\n{ts:1163} going  to  do  the  or  the  Iron  Man.  He's \n going  to  do  the  training  and  then\n{ts:1166} \n decide.  And  I  was  like,  you're  going to \n\n{ts:1167} have  to  decide  pretty  quick  because  I \n think  they  sell  out  pretty  quick,  don't\n{ts:1169} \n they? \n\n{ts:1170} >> Yeah.  I  He's  probably  got  a  little \n while.  I  mean,  we're  we're  a  ways  out.\n{ts:1172} \n >> Yeah. \n\n{ts:1173} >> But  yeah,  they  do  fill  up  for  sure. \n >> Yep.\n{ts:1176} \n >> And  that's  never  a  good  strategy. \n\n{ts:1178} >> When  are  you  going  to  decide? \n >> I  don't  know.  I  mean,  and  when  I  can\n{ts:1182} \n walk. \n\n{ts:1183} >> Wait,  what? \n >> So,  who  even  is  in  on  this  besides  you?\n{ts:1186} \n >> Kelsey  might  do  it. \n\n{ts:1187} >> Kelsey  Campfield.  Uh, \n >> who  is  registered?  Mala,  myself,  and\n{ts:1192} \n you. \n\n{ts:1192} >> Oh,  you  registered? \n >> So,  who's  registered?  That's  good.\n{ts:1195} \n >> Nobody  was  that. \n\n{ts:1196} >> Okay.  Nobody. \n >> What  do  you  mean?\n{ts:1199} \n >> Is  Jake  do  it? \n\n{ts:1200} >> Uh, \n >> he's  tempted  now  that  we're  all  doing\n{ts:1202} \n it. \n\n{ts:1202} >> Yeah.  He's  having  FOMO. \n >> Yeah.\n{ts:1204} \n >> Didn't  he  have  like  a  bad  problem  with \n\n{ts:1206} the  last  one? \n >> Yeah.\n{ts:1207} \n >> He  was  cramped  up  like  crazy  diarrhea. \n\n{ts:1209} >> What  do  you  mean  by  something?  Right.  I \n mean  like\n{ts:1211} \n >> who  specializes  in  triathlons? \n\n{ts:1213} >> Yeah.  Type  thing. \n >> I  don't  know  if  we  have  anybody  around\n{ts:1215} \n here  that  specializes. \n\n{ts:1217} >> Like  I  would  say  locker's  probably  good \n >> besides  cramping  up.\n{ts:1219} \n >> I  think  I  could  beat  Locker. \n\n{ts:1221} >> No. \n >> You  think  you  can  beat  Jake?\n{ts:1222} \n >> Yeah. \n\n{ts:1223} >> Yeah. \n >> Yeah.  I  think  you  beat  Jake.  Yeah.\n{ts:1225} \n Sorry. \n\n{ts:1225} >> The  amount  of  volume  he's  built  on  a \n mountain  bike.\n{ts:1227} \n >> Well,  you  you're  be  good  at  the  swim. \n\n{ts:1229} >> I  don't  want  you  think  you  have  to  train \n for  the  swim  hardly.\n{ts:1231} \n >> I'm  going  to  train  to  train  the  bike  or \n\n{ts:1234} the  swim.  I'm  going  to  mountain  bike \n until\n{ts:1236} \n >> it's  a  road  bike,  right? \n\n{ts:1237} >> Yeah.  I'm  going  to  mountain  bike.  use  my \n mountain  bike  training  for  Amarillo  up\n{ts:1241} \n until  probably  July  or  August  and  then \n\n{ts:1244} I'll  start  road  biking  slash \n >> time  trial  or  whatever  I  need  to  get\n{ts:1249} \n some  type  of  bike.  Yeah, \n\n{ts:1251} >> you  should  get  time  on  your  feet  then. \n >> And  I'm  slowly  going  to  start  on  Sundays\n{ts:1255} \n adding  some  volume  just  I'm  talking  very \n\n{ts:1259} slow  and  see  what  happens.  Yeah, \n I  think  I  you  know  I  was  I  did  a  bunch\n{ts:1266} \n of  interval  not  a  bunch  but  a  couple \n\n{ts:1268} intervals  of  like  I  did  six  miles  on \n Sunday.  My  knee  was  okay  and  I  have  not\n{ts:1273} \n ran  anything  over  two  miles  in  probably \n\n{ts:1274} six  months.  So \n >> what's  funny  to  me  is  there  was  a  time\n{ts:1277} \n when  you  said  you  had  never  ever  run  a \n\n{ts:1280} marathon. \n >> Yeah.\n{ts:1280} \n >> And  you  you  probably  still  haven't  ever \n\n{ts:1282} run  a  marathon. \n >> I  don't  want  to  run  uh\n{ts:1283} \n >> and  now  you're  going  to  run  a  marathon \n\n{ts:1285} at  the  end  of  a \n >> me  and  Scott  basically  ran  what\n{ts:1289} \n >> right  at  it?  21  miles  short  or  21  5 \n\n{ts:1292} miles  short  of  a  marathon. \n >> That's  the  hardest  part.\n{ts:1295} \n >> Zero  with  zero  training  whatsoever. \n\n{ts:1297} >> Yeah. \n >> Or  sleep.\n{ts:1298} \n >> Or  sleep  or  food. \n\n{ts:1299} >> Or  water. \n >> Or  water.\n{ts:1301} \n >> Or  water. \n\n{ts:1301} >> It  was  19\u00b0. \n >> Yes,  it  was.  And  I  was  in  pants.  It  was\n{ts:1306} \n like  claustrophobic. \n\n{ts:1307} >> Oh  gosh. \n >> So  bad.\n{ts:1309} \n >> And  I  think  I  had  to  give  you  I  think  I \n\n{ts:1311} gave  you  my  one  of  my  shirts  or \n something  like  the  three/4er  zip.  I\n{ts:1316} \n don't  remember  what  happened. \n\n{ts:1317} >> Yeah.  I  was  wearing  an  origin  shirt,  I \n think,  because  of\n{ts:1320} \n >> Yeah.  And  it  got  too  hot,  maybe.  And  I \n\n{ts:1322} had  two  things.  I  don't  remember. \n >> I  don't  either.\n{ts:1324} \n >> Was  it  also  when  you  didn't  have \n\n{ts:1325} toothbrush? \n >> No.\n{ts:1327} \n >> No,  that  was  a  different  time. \n\n{ts:1328} >> Different  trip. \n >> Different  trip.\n{ts:1330} \n >> Yeah.  For  some  reason,  I  put  on  pants. \n\n{ts:1332} That  was  a  horrible  move  that  day. \n >> It  was  19  degrees,  so  that's  probably\n{ts:1335} \n why. \n\n{ts:1335} >> Yeah.  But  still,  even  like  I  didn't  know \n we  were  going  to  run  a  marathon.  We  were\n{ts:1338} \n doing  morning  miles  with  Cam, \n\n{ts:1340} >> you  know.  Miles. \n >> So,  that's  probably  the  most  you've  run\n{ts:1342} \n so  far,  right?  Ever  one  day.  I  trained \n\n{ts:1345} to  run  a  marathon \n shoot  probably  15  years  ago  and  I  got  to\n{ts:1351} \n like  20  I  think  one  day  in  training  I \n\n{ts:1354} was  supposed  to  do  like  21  or  22  or  18 \n or  something  and  I  just  went  ahead  and\n{ts:1357} \n ran  the  26  and  then  I  felt  like  I  was \n\n{ts:1360} getting  really  slow  so  I  hated  I  was \n like  I  don't  want  to  do  this.  I  don't\n{ts:1362} \n want  to  be  that  type  of  athlete. \n\n{ts:1364} >> Yeah. \n >> So  I  just  quit  training.\n{ts:1366} \n So,  I  think  I've  actually  ran  a  marathon \n\n{ts:1368} a  long  time  ago,  but \n >> I  just  I  don't  want  to  be  I  like  the  if\n{ts:1374} \n we're  the  reason  I'm  doing  this  is \n\n{ts:1376} because  it  is  so  far  out  of  my  comfort \n zone  of  what  I  want  to  do  or  what  I  want\n{ts:1380} \n to  be  and  I  need  to  do  that  every  once \n\n{ts:1382} in  a  while. \n >> I  would  prefer  to  do  something  like\n{ts:1385} \n Amarillo  that  sucks  still. \n\n{ts:1387} >> Yeah. \n >> But  it's  more  power  output,  30,  40\n{ts:1389} \n minutes  rest  for  an  hour  or  two  or  like \n\n{ts:1392} >> kind  of  adventurous  too.  You  know  what \n I'm  saying?  Like  I  mean  like  road  bike\n{ts:1395} \n versus  mountain  bike.  Mountain  bike  like \n\n{ts:1397} you're  reacting  and  you  got \n >> Yeah.  It's  fun.  It's  a  it's  athletic.\n{ts:1400} \n Yeah.  You  know,  like  um \n\n{ts:1402} >> Yeah.  100%. \n >> But  I  do  I  really  did  enjoy  the  street\n{ts:1405} \n portion  of  the  the  half  that  I  did. \n\n{ts:1406} >> Did  you? \n >> Yeah.  You're  just  cruising,  you  know,\n{ts:1409} \n and  if  we  get  some  of  those  nice  bikes \n\n{ts:1410} like  you're  hauling  ass,  you  know. \n >> That  being  said,  if  you  want  to  become\n{ts:1413} \n an  iron  man  the  same  day, \n\n{ts:1415} >> sponsor  Iron  Man  team  and \n >> what  is  it?  P.  No,  Panama  City.\n{ts:1420} \n >> Panama  City. \n\n{ts:1421} >> Panama  City.  November  7th.  Is  it  not \n going  to  be  pretty  hot?  Not  November.\n{ts:1425} \n >> Anyone  that  comes, \n\n{ts:1425} >> I  don't  know.  I  hope  not. \n >> Anyone  that  shows  an  Apple  Mayhem\n{ts:1429} \n subscription  the  day  they  do  it  can  get \n\n{ts:1431} the  Iron  Man  tattoo  on  their  calf  with \n Rich.\n{ts:1433} \n >> I  will  not  be  getting  Iron  Man. \n\n{ts:1435} >> Oh,  you  better  get  the  Iron  Man  tattoo. \n >> Yeah,\n{ts:1437} \n >> we  need  to  Hey,  we  all  need  to  like  jump \n\n{ts:1439} him  at  the  end  of  the  marathon  when  he \n can't  fight  back.\n{ts:1442} \n >> Drain  a  tattoo. \n\n{ts:1443} >> Watkins  said  he  wants  to  get  it  just  so \n he  can  get  the  tattoo.  I'll  put  the\n{ts:1446} \n sticker  on  my  car. \n\n{ts:1448} >> When  you  try  to  like  fight  back,  you \n just  cramp  like  No,  stop.  Please.\n{ts:1452} \n >> So,  here  it  gives  you  a  high  and  low \n\n{ts:1454} high  and  low  air  temp \n >> 8161.\n{ts:1457} \n >> Is  the  average  or  that's  the  highest \n\n{ts:1460} it's  ever  been? \n >> I  don't  know  if  it's  ever  or  whatever.\n{ts:1462} \n Um,  and  your  average  water  temp  71. \n\n{ts:1466} >> That's  probably  pretty  good. \n >> It's  not  cold.  That's  for  sure.\n{ts:1468} \n >> 71's  not  bad.  I  think  like  70  degrees  is \n\n{ts:1471} like  pretty  good  water  temp,  right?  It's \n like\n{ts:1473} \n >> I  don't  know.  I'm  gonna  check.  Is  that \n\n{ts:1475} wet  suit? \n >> Let's  check.  Let's  check.\n{ts:1477} \n Really  wants  to  use  the  wet  suit.  I  was \n\n{ts:1479} going  to  ask,  do  you  wear  like  a \n bodysuit  like  the  uh\n{ts:1481} \n >> I'll  wear  a  try  I'll  wear  a  triuit.

Yeah.  You're  famous. \n >> Um,  yeah.  We're  just  getting  into  uh\n{ts:1528} \n getting  into  triathlon  stuff. \n\n{ts:1531} >> Well,  I  mean, \n >> you're  in.\n{ts:1535} \n >> You're  in.  We're  all  in.  All right.  All \n\n{ts:1538} right,  we'll  call  you  back. \n >> Yeah,  my  game  plan  is  to  swim  twice  a\n{ts:1541} \n week.  Probably  about  2k  meters  each \n\n{ts:1543} time.  Um  maybe  slowly  ramp  that  up  one \n longerish  day.  Open  water  stuff  when  it\n{ts:1551} \n gets  warmer.  Probably  when  I  start \n\n{ts:1553} training  for  Amarillo,  then  I'll  start \n adding  maybe  two  to  three  bikes  a  week\n{ts:1557} \n and  then  interval  interval  session  of \n\n{ts:1561} around  5  to  8K  running. \n Um.\n{ts:1567} \n >> Oh,  okay. \n\n{ts:1568} >> One  Metcon  a  week  with  running  and  then \n a  long  slow  day  on  Sunday.\n{ts:1572} \n >> Are  you  going  to  do  any  like  brick \n\n{ts:1573} workouts? \n >> Who's  that?\n{ts:1575} \n >> He  knows  about  like  like  swim  into  the \n\n{ts:1579} bike. \n >> Yeah,  for  sure.\n{ts:1580} \n >> Yeah.  Honestly,  just  bike  into  run. \n\n{ts:1583} >> Yeah, \n >> that's  the  hardest  when  I  did  those\n{ts:1585} \n couple  triathlons.  The  first  one \n\n{ts:1587} especially  going  from  a  bike  into  the \n run  is  awful.  Your  back\n{ts:1592} \n >> Yeah.  and  you're  like  all  crushed  up  and \n\n{ts:1593} you're  you  kind  of are  in  a  comfortable \n position  on  the  bike  at  towards  the  end\n{ts:1597} \n and  then  when  you  get  off  you're  like  oh \n\n{ts:1598} no \n >> maybe  do  some  off-road  triathlons  here\n{ts:1602} \n >> to  prep.  What  do  you  think,  bro? \n\n{ts:1604} >> Yeah.  Hell  yeah.  Um  even  the  Fall  Creek \n Falls  I  was  telling  you  that's  a  good\n{ts:1608} \n one. \n\n{ts:1608} >> Yeah.  I  don't  know if  I'm  going to  do \n like  a  half  or  anything  like  I  think\n{ts:1611} \n I'll  just  do  whatever. \n\n{ts:1612} >> They  have  a  sprint,  they  have an  Olympic \n and  then  they  have  a  half.  So  like\n{ts:1615} \n >> you  know  I  think  you'd  think \n\n{ts:1617} >> when  is  that  one  though?  In  August. \n >> August.\n{ts:1619} \n >> Still  crossfit  mode  at  that  point.  You \n\n{ts:1621} know, \n >> here's  the  deal.  Wets  suits  are\n{ts:1623} \n mandatory  below  60.8, \n\n{ts:1626} prohibited  above  83.8, \n >> and  optional,\n{ts:1630} \n >> yeah, \n\n{ts:1631} >> between  76.2  and  83.8.  So, \n >> optional  but  ineligible.  Anyways,  we'll\n{ts:1636} \n be  in  the  zone  either  way. \n\n{ts:1637} >> Wait,  you  said  76. \n >> Uh,  they're  optional  between  76  and  83\n{ts:1642} \n and  the  water  was  71  theoretically. \n\n{ts:1645} >> Oh,  yeah.  So,  you  should  for  sure. \n >> We're  praying  for  less  than  76.  This\n{ts:1647} \n says  average  is  71.  But  then  if  you  wear \n\n{ts:1650} one,  you're  disqualified  from  anything. \n >> No,  only  if  it's  above  76.\n{ts:1654} \n >> Oh,  okay. \n\n{ts:1655} >> Yeah.  If  you  can  wear  one,  you  should \n wear  one.\n{ts:1657} \n >> Or  at least  get  the  at  least  wear  the \n\n{ts:1659} get  the  shorts.  You  can  wear  those \n whenever.\n{ts:1661} \n >> I've  never  worn \n\n{ts:1661} >> the  neoprene  shorts. \n >> You  have  to  wear  those  cuz  you're  going\n{ts:1663} \n to  get  out  of  the  water  at  some  point. \n\n{ts:1665} >> No,  you're  talking  about  try  short. \n >> I'm  talking  about  Yeah,  I'm  talking\n{ts:1667} \n about  the  thick  ones.  Like  the  they're \n\n{ts:1669} wets  suit,  but  they're  shorts.  You  can \n always  wear  those.  I  think  even  pants.  I\n{ts:1673} \n could  be  wrong  there,  but  I  think  you \n\n{ts:1675} can  wear  pants  no matter  what. \n >> You  want  that.  me  wearing  pants.\n{ts:1679} \n >> Not  just  for  the  swim  and  then  you  have \n\n{ts:1681} your  you  have  your  regular  uh \n >> jammers.\n{ts:1683} \n >> You  have  to  just  No,  you  have  like  your \n\n{ts:1685} bike  shorts  underneath  it  or  whatever  it \n is.\n{ts:1687} \n >> You  have  that  underneath  it. \n\n{ts:1688} >> You  just  want  a  little  bit  of  floaty \n float.\n{ts:1689} \n >> Yeah, \n\n{ts:1690} >> for  sure. \n >> I  guess  I  need  to  read  up  on  this.\n{ts:1693} \n >> You  can  get  the  cuz  you \n\n{ts:1694} >> Hebrew's  doing  it,  right? \n >> He's  going  to  do  it,  man.  And  I'm\n{ts:1697} \n telling  you,  and  I  understand  why,  so \n\n{ts:1699} I'm  not  mad,  but \n >> Portugal  sounds  freaking  awesome.  Yeah,\n{ts:1705} \n >> if  we  if  we  like  it  and  we're  going  to \n\n{ts:1706} do  it  again.  If  I  ever  do  one  again,  I'm \n going  to  a  crazy  location.\n{ts:1709} \n >> I  might  This  might  be  a  one  and  done.  I \n\n{ts:1711} think \n >> might  be  one  and  done.  But  I  was  the\n{ts:1713} \n Portugal  one. \n\n{ts:1713} >> Yeah. \n >> A  portion  of  the  bike  race  you  go  on  the\n{ts:1715} \n F1  track. \n\n{ts:1716} >> Oh,  that's  cool. \n >> Pretty  freaking  sweet.  So  you're  like,\n{ts:1719} \n you  know,  doing \n\n{ts:1720} >> are  you  going  like  big  big  the  big  banks \n or  No.\n{ts:1722} \n >> Yeah. \n\n{ts:1723} >> Do  you  have  to  like  stay  on  course  like \n F1  and  if  you  pass  somebody  have  like\n{ts:1727} \n goes  to  race  control? \n\n{ts:1729} >> I  didn't  look  into  it  that  deeply. \n >> I  tried  to  watch  I  tried  to  watch  an  F1\n{ts:1733} \n race.  You  know,  I'm  a  NASCAR  purist  and \n\n{ts:1735} we  watched  that  movie,  the  F1  movie,  and \n it's  a  really  good  movie.  Great  movie.\n{ts:1740} \n But  I  w  tried  to  watch  an  F1  race,  I \n\n{ts:1742} think,  when  we  were  going  to  London  the \n last  time.\n{ts:1746} \n We  had  live  TV  or  something.  Maybe  it \n\n{ts:1748} wasn't  London,  but  uh  I  think  it  was  I \n don't  remember.  Anyway,  I'm  like,  \"All\n{ts:1752} \n right,  I'm  going  to  watch  a  full  F1 \n\n{ts:1754} race.\"  I  hated  it. \n >> What  do  you  What  did  you  hate  about  it\n{ts:1757} \n compared  to  NASCAR?  I  feel  like  it's \n\n{ts:1759} >> like  they  tried  to  they  made  one  pass \n and  it  was  like,  \"Oh,  it's  going  to  race\n{ts:1763} \n control. \n\n{ts:1764} >> Nope,  they  have  to  give  that  position \n back.\"  And  you're  just  like,  \"What?  You\n{ts:1767} \n have  to  give  a  position  back?\"  And  so  I \n\n{ts:1769} don't know.  It  just  I'm  sure  if  I  knew \n the  rules,  but  I  watched,  you  know,  the\n{ts:1773} \n movie  was  great.  I  thought  it  was  great. \n\n{ts:1774} >> The  movie  was  great. \n >> Yeah.\n{ts:1776} \n >> Red  Pit. \n\n{ts:1777} >> Yeah. \n >> It  felt  like  uh\n{ts:1778} \n >> I'm  not  a  fan  of  the  sport  at  all. \n\n{ts:1779} >> It  felt  like  Maverick,  you  know,  the \n sequel  to  Top  Gun.\n{ts:1782} \n >> It  felt  like  this  was  the  sequel  to  Days \n\n{ts:1784} of  Thunder.  That's  what  it  felt  like. \n You  know,  a  lot  of  the  shots  were  the\n{ts:1787} \n same. \n\n{ts:1788} >> Oh,  that's  cool. \n >> And  probably  if  you're  a  mega  fan,  there\n{ts:1790} \n was  things  about  it  where  you're  like, \n\n{ts:1790} \"Oh  yeah,  hated  it.\" \n >> Like  if  you  go  back  on  Days  of  Thunder.\n{ts:1794} \n It's  not  true  to  NASCAR  whatsoever. \n\n{ts:1797} >> But  yeah.  So,  um,  what  else?  What  other \n I  mean,  Iron  Man's  the  big  thing.\n{ts:1805} \n >> Got  those  challenges.  I  think  Jake's \n\n{ts:1806} going  to  try  to  come  up  with  a  version \n that,  um,  gyms  can  do  at  the  do  along\n{ts:1812} \n with  us. \n\n{ts:1813} >> Yeah.  at  the  affiliates.  We're  going  to \n start  doing  that.  And  then  we  we've\n{ts:1817} \n talked  about  running  a  um  I  don't know \n\n{ts:1819} if  I'm  allowed  to  say  it,  but  I'm  gonna \n say  it.  Um\n{ts:1823} \n run  some  online  workouts  in  parallel  to \n\n{ts:1827} the  Mayhem  Classic. \n >> It  won't  be  exact.  Obviously,  we  talked\n{ts:1830} \n about  talked  about  doing  some  something \n\n{ts:1832} where  people  can  participate  and  watch \n and  kind  of  ping  pong  back  and  forth.\n{ts:1837} \n >> Yeah,  that  I  mean  it's  definitely \n\n{ts:1838} happening.  So,  it's  okay  to  talk  about. \n We  just  don't  know  what  capacity  yet.\n{ts:1841} \n So,  it'll  be  fun.  We  talked  about  today \n\n{ts:1843} about  like  kind  of  divisions  and  stuff \n and  how  we  can  break  it  down.  I  think  we\n{ts:1847} \n have  a  decent  idea.  Him  and  Dane  were \n\n{ts:1849} talking  about  like  logistics.  So,  I \n don't  know.  They'll  work  on  that  and\n{ts:1852} \n then  we'll  when  we  get  the  workouts, \n\n{ts:1854} we'll  make  it  doable  for \n >> you.  Won't  everyone  else?\n{ts:1857} \n >> I  will. \n\n{ts:1859} >> You  can't  look  at  them.  You  have  an \n athlete.\n{ts:1860} \n >> No.  Oh,  you're  going  to  program  them \n\n{ts:1862} before  Yeah.  I  guess  you  I  guess \n >> I  want  to  try  to  make  them  as  close  to\n{ts:1866} \n >> Yeah. \n\n{ts:1867} >> So,  I  don't  want  to  give  away  too  much. \n >> We  can  invite  Kellan  back  and  so  people\n{ts:1870} \n have  someone  to  beat.  Yeah.  Is  he  has  he \n\n{ts:1873} disappeared? \n >> Yes.\n{ts:1874} \n >> Yeah. \n\n{ts:1875} >> Yeah. \n >> Um,  can  we  invite  Jacob  Cobb\n{ts:1880} \n >> to  do  the  online  portion? \n\n{ts:1881} >> Oh,  to  come. \n >> Oh,  yeah.  Why?  What  was  that?\n{ts:1885} \n >> That, \n\n{ts:1885} >> huh? \n >> Oh,  AI.\n{ts:1887} \n >> He  had  Dude,  there's  so  many  people  in \n\n{ts:1888} the  comments  like  tag  him. \n >> Yeah.\n{ts:1891} \n >> And  I  don't  know.  He  said  he  would  train \n\n{ts:1893} for  it.  So, \n >> this  is  him  shooting  a  shot.\n{ts:1895} \n >> Did  you  just  AI  that  or  what  did  you  do? \n\n{ts:1898} >> Uh,  yeah.  Yeah. \n >> You  think  he  could  not  take  last  in  one\n{ts:1900} \n event?  Well,  he  beat  Cal  at  all  the \n\n{ts:1902} workouts  last  year.  He  did  all  of  them. \n >> Beat  him  in  all  of  them.\n{ts:1904} \n >> For  reference,  for  reference, \n\n{ts:1906} >> except  for  Isabelle. \n >> Jake  Cobb  is  a  he's  one  of  those\n{ts:1909} \n athletes  like  in  your  gym  that  can  do \n\n{ts:1912} everything. \n >> He's  also  a  realtor.\n{ts:1914} \n >> He's  also  But  I'm  What  I'm  But  what  I'm \n\n{ts:1916} saying  is  like  he  has  all  the  skills. \n >> Yeah.\n{ts:1919} \n >> Maybe  not  the  capacity  of  the  elite,  but \n\n{ts:1920} he  can  do  everything.  A  lot  like \n >> a  lot  like  Well,  minus  the  strong  part.\n{ts:1925} \n Watkins.  Watkins  can  do  everything \n\n{ts:1927} oddly. \n >> Yeah.\n{ts:1928} \n >> But  he  just  doesn't  move  fast  ever.  Do \n\n{ts:1930} you  do  ring  muscle-ups? \n >> Yeah.\n{ts:1932} \n >> Yeah,  for  sure. \n\n{ts:1932} >> I've  never  seen  him  do  one.  That's  the \n only  reason  I  asked.\n{ts:1935} \n >> Let's  ask  him. \n\n{ts:1936} >> Let's  ask  him.  I  did  some  on  Saturday. \n >> No,  me  and  JB.\n{ts:1942} \n >> He's  hiding  from  the  rem. \n\n{ts:1944} >> He  doesn't  want  everyone  to  hear  weird. \n He  doesn't  want  his  weakness.\n{ts:1947} \n >> One  thing  he  can't  do. \n\n{ts:1950} >> They'll  text,  \"Hey,  you  guys,  what  are \n you  guys  doing?\"  Uh,  can  musled?\n{ts:1953} \n >> Uh,  no.  He  flat  usually.  So,  handstand \n\n{ts:1955} ramp  is  Yeah,  probably  out  of the \n question.  He  could  probably  do  He  could\n{ts:1958} \n probably  do  it, \n\n{ts:1959} >> but  just  not. \n >> He  probably  can.\n{ts:1961} \n >> Let's  just  make  him  Let's  go  test  all \n\n{ts:1963} these  theories. \n >> We  did  that  uh\n{ts:1966} \n >> workout  you  gave  Paige,  the  100  foot,  50 \n\n{ts:1969} foot,  100  foot  sled  push,  50  foot  foot \n handstand  walk.\n{ts:1973} \n >> We  just  did  90  and  60  cuz  it  was  on  the \n\n{ts:1975} 10  rounds.  That  was  bad. \n >> Yeah,\n{ts:1978} \n >> I  saw  her  doing  it.  We  were  doing  some \n\n{ts:1979} echo  bike,  alternating  minute  echo  bike, \n 15  cal,  15  toes  bar  to  kind  of  get\n{ts:1984} \n warmed  up.  And  I  saw  her  doing  that  and \n\n{ts:1985} I  was  like,  that'd  be  a  good  finisher. \n And  I  did  the  first  round.  It  took  90\n{ts:1989} \n seconds.  I'm  like,  dang  it.  I'm  in  this \n\n{ts:1991} for  15  minutes  at  least. \n >> Uh,\n{ts:1993} \n >> but  he  did  that  workout. \n\n{ts:1995} >> Oh. \n >> Flat  flat  ground.\n{ts:1997} \n >> 500  on  his  wall. \n\n{ts:1998} >> Yeah.  600  cuz  we  did  60  feet. \n >> Oh  yeah.  Oh  yeah.\n{ts:2001} \n >> 10  less  feet  on  the  sled  push.  That \n\n{ts:2004} workout  was  not  pleasant. \n >> Yeah.  But  just  like  I  mean  for  her  like\n{ts:2008} \n hand  to  walk  is  literally  rest.  Like \n\n{ts:2009} she's  just  walking  pretty  much.  So  it's \n it's  I  can't\n{ts:2012} \n >> it  becomes  the  last  like  three  or  four \n\n{ts:2014} rounds  becomes  less  than  rest. \n >> Yeah.  Well,  like  I  Yeah,  you  you're\n{ts:2018} \n >> My  traps  were  fried  from  that.  Scott, \n\n{ts:2020} you  might  like  that  one. \n >> What  was  the  workout?\n{ts:2023} \n >> 10  rounds.  Ben,  you  would  60  or  90  foot \n\n{ts:2026} hand  shoot.  10  rounds.  90  foot  sled  push \n with  three  plates  and  60  foot  handstand\n{ts:2033} \n walk  with  the  obstacle  in  the  middle  of \n\n{ts:2035} the  60  ft. \n >> Disaster  for  me.\n{ts:2040} \n >> Um  I  Ben  saw  Hatfield  do  one  that  I \n\n{ts:2043} programmed  for  him.  Two  minutes  on,  one \n minute  off.\n{ts:2046} \n >> Oh,  yeah.  You  told  me  about that. \n\n{ts:2047} >> Burpee  box  jump  over,  16  dumbbell \n snatch,  max  bar  muscle-ups.\n{ts:2050} \n >> Oh,  no,  never  mind.  I  didn't  know  that \n\n{ts:2052} one. \n >> What  was  it?\n{ts:2053} \n >> So,  it's  two  on,  one  off, \n\n{ts:2055} >> 12  burpee  box  jump  overs,  16  dumbbell \n snatch  with  a  70  max  bar  muscle  ups  in\n{ts:2060} \n the  remaining  time  till  you  get  to  50. \n\n{ts:2062} >> What'  that  take? \n >> He  he  did  it  in  five  sets.  Oh,\n{ts:2065} \n >> but  there  was  it  was a  six  set  cap,  too. \n\n{ts:2067} But  he  uh  they  texted  me  earlier  in  the \n morning,  him  and  Haley,  saying  how  sore\n{ts:2071} \n they  were  from  the  thruster  workout  on \n\n{ts:2072} Friday.  12  minute  16. \n >> 12  was  like  for  him  was  like  45  seconds\n{ts:2077} \n and  then  he  was  probably  getting  45 \n\n{ts:2079} seconds  on  the  first  couple  rounds \n roughly  for  the  muscleups.\n{ts:2083} \n >> 40ish \n\n{ts:2084} >> 40  seconds  on  the  first  round. \n >> Yeah.\n{ts:2086} \n >> I  was  hoping  you  would  get  over  30.  Like \n\n{ts:2088} I  was  hoping  if  he  get  over  30  you  can \n jump  up  and  do  a  set  of  10  and  do  it  in\n{ts:2092} \n five  sets.  Like  that's  kind  of  what  I \n\n{ts:2094} thought  he  would  do. \n >> Those  dude  that  looked  like  such  a  bad\n{ts:2097} \n workout. \n\n{ts:2097} >> It  sounds  awful. \n >> Well,  it  was  supposed  to  be  50  foot\n{ts:2099} \n lunge.  16  dumbbell  snatches  with  a  70. \n\n{ts:2102} >> It  was  supposed  to  be  a  50  foot  lunge \n with  double  50s,  but  they  texted  and\n{ts:2107} \n said  their  legs  were  so  sore  from  the \n\n{ts:2108} thrusters.  I  was  like,  well,  I'm  like,  I \n don't  really  know  what  to  put  here.  And\n{ts:2111} \n like  based  on  the  other  stuff  they  were \n\n{ts:2112} doing,  I'm  like,  well,  dumbbell  snatch \n would  fit.  Like,  he  hasn't  snatched  a\n{ts:2114} \n moderately  heavy  dumbbell  in  a  little \n\n{ts:2116} while.  And  I  I  was  sitting  there,  I'm \n looking  at  I'm  like,  this  looks  really\n{ts:2119} \n hard.  So,  I  asked  Jake,  I  said,  hey,  do \n\n{ts:2121} you  think  he  could  do  this? \n >> You  can't  ask  Jake.\n{ts:2123} \n >> He  goes  He  goes,  it's  hard,  but  he  could \n\n{ts:2125} do  it.  And  um  yeah,  I  mean  there's  a  six \n set  cap  he  did  in  five  sets,  so\n{ts:2129} \n obviously  it  was  fine,  but \n\n{ts:2130} >> fine.  Geez. \n >> Sounds  so  He  said  it  looked  hard.  It\n{ts:2133} \n sounded  so  hard.  He  text  me.  He  said, \n\n{ts:2135} \"Brother,  you  have  to  do  that  workout.\" \n I  said,  \"I  can't  do  that  workout.  I\n{ts:2139} \n programmed  it  for  you  cuz  I  know  I  can't \n\n{ts:2141} do  it.\" \n >> That's  awful.\n{ts:2144} \n So  he  got  fitter  yesterday. \n\n{ts:2146} >> Breaking  news  that  no  one  cares  about, \n but  Mike  Tomlin  is  stepping  down  as  a\n{ts:2149} \n Steelers  head  coach. \n\n{ts:2150} >> Did  they  lose  last  night?  I  didn't \n watch.\n{ts:2151} \n >> Yeah.  Oh,  it  was  terrible. \n\n{ts:2152} >> Who'  they  get  beat  by? \n >> The  Texans.  It  was  embarrassing.  Texans\n{ts:2155} \n were  are  good, \n\n{ts:2156} >> but  it  was  just  you  had \n >> he's  stepping  down.\n{ts:2158} \n >> Yeah,  he's  not  he's  not  getting  I  mean, \n\n{ts:2159} who  knows?  But \n >> isn't  he  like  the  third  coach  in\n{ts:2161} \n Steelers  history  or  something  like  that? \n\n{ts:2163} >> Close  to  it.  Yeah. \n >> And  it  but  it  wasn't  even  like  they  had\n{ts:2166} \n to  they  had  to  work  to  lose  like  you  see \n\n{ts:2168} where  the  where  he  fumbled  twice  in  the \n same  had  three  he  threw  two  picks.  He\n{ts:2171} \n had  Aaron  Rogers.  He  had  no  he  fumbled \n\n{ts:2174} twice  on  the  same  twice.  He  lost  fumbles \n >> and  they  still  lost.\n{ts:2178} \n >> Yes.  It  was  the  worst  game  I've  ever \n\n{ts:2179} watched. \n >> It  was  amazing.  He  like  he  like  bobbles\n{ts:2181} \n a  snap,  bounces  off  the  turf,  he  picks \n\n{ts:2182} it  back  up, \n >> and  then  he  like  Do  you  see  this  one?\n{ts:2186} \n >> Yeah,  I  watched  the  whole  thing \n\n{ts:2187} unfortunately. \n >> And  then  it  like  and  then  it  just  gets\n{ts:2188} \n tipped  out  of  his  hand  and  he  like  still \n\n{ts:2190} kind  of  confusing  throws  it. \n >> There  was  one  where  he  you  it  was\n{ts:2193} \n unclear  if  it  was  a  fumble  or  an  like  a \n\n{ts:2196} fumble  that  guy  recovered  an \n interception,  but  it  they  didn't  have  to\n{ts:2198} \n review  it  because  he  either  fumbled  or \n\n{ts:2201} threw  it,  but  the  defensive  lineman \n intercepted  it.  Either  way,  it  ended  up\n{ts:2205} \n being  a  fumble,  but  it  didn't  matter. \n\n{ts:2206} It's  just  a  stat  line.  And  and  then  he's \n like  talking  [\u00a0__\u00a0]  to  the  fans  after  CJ\n{ts:2211} \n Strad.  I'm  like,  \"Bro,  you  literally  you \n\n{ts:2214} like  I  could  have  played  quarterback.  It \n would  have  been  a  better  final  score\n{ts:2217} \n than  what  happened.\"  Anyway,  Mike  Tomlin \n\n{ts:2220} out. \n >> It  was  rough.  Rough.\n{ts:2221} \n >> Dang. \n\n{ts:2221} >> I  don't  know if  I  agree  with  that. \n >> All  of  my  football  teams,  well,  I  mean,\n{ts:2224} \n he  quit,  I  guess.  So,  I  wouldn't  have \n\n{ts:2226} necessarily  agreed  if  they  got  if  they \n fired  him,  but  he  has  now  lost  the  most\n{ts:2230} \n consecutive  playoff  games  in  NFL  history \n\n{ts:2233} tied  with  Marvin  Lewis. \n >> Okay,  that's  not  a  good  stat.  if  you  say\n{ts:2236} \n it  like  that. \n\n{ts:2237} >> Yeah.  So,  it's  like  I  don't  know,  but  uh \n yeah,  my  football  teams  are  in\n{ts:2241} \n >> Maybe  the  Lions  will  pick  him  up  for \n\n{ts:2242} something.  That'd  be  good.  I'd  like  him. \n >> Michigan.\n{ts:2244} \n >> I  like  him. \n\n{ts:2245} >> He's  a  defensive  guy,  right? \n >> Uh  he's  not  been  in  any  Yeah.  If\n{ts:2249} \n anything,  he's  a  defensive  guy,  but \n\n{ts:2250} >> Well,  Kelvin  Shepard's  probably  leaving, \n so  that'  be  nice.\n{ts:2252} \n >> It's  crazy  though  cuz  Mike  Tomlin  was \n\n{ts:2254} the  youngest  head  coach  ever  to  win  a \n Super  Bowl  when  he  won.\n{ts:2257} \n >> Oh,  yeah. \n\n{ts:2257} >> Um  and  and  then  19  years  later, \n >> Scott,  at  least  you  have  that.\n{ts:2261} \n >> Yeah. \n\n{ts:2262} >> How  old  was  he \n >> when  he  won?  I  think  he  was  like  28.\n{ts:2265} \n >> Dang.  Yeah.  Which  is  crazy  because  it \n\n{ts:2266} makes  me  think  I  haven't  done  anything \n with  my  life.\n{ts:2269} \n >> Yeah,  that's  crazy.  Well,  like  think \n\n{ts:2270} about  he's  coaching  I'd  say  a  good \n amount  of  the  players  were  older  than\n{ts:2274} \n him  at  that  like  players  on  his  team. \n\n{ts:2276} Maybe  not  a  good  amount,  but  like  at \n least  the  same  age.\n{ts:2278} \n >> Some  for  sure.  Yeah. \n\n{ts:2279} >> Yeah.  Some  for  sure. \n >> That  is  kind  of  crazy.\n{ts:2282} \n >> Yeah,  cuz  I  um  Sean  McVey  what  mid30s  or \n\n{ts:2286} something  like  that  when  he  became \n coach?\n{ts:2288} \n >> Yeah.  I  don't  remember. \n\n{ts:2289} >> That  was  super  young.  I  feel  like \n >> let  me  look\n{ts:2291} \n >> 28.  Mike  Tom  was  28  when  he \n\n{ts:2294} >> That's  crazy. \n >> Let  me  fact  check  myself.\n{ts:2296} \n >> Yeah, \n\n{ts:2297} >> that's  probably  not  far  off.  I  was  gonna \n say  like  30  or  31.  So,  you're  pretty\n{ts:2300} \n close.  Definitely. \n\n{ts:2302} >> He  was \n >> No,  I  was  way  off.  He  was  36.\n{ts:2306} \n >> Oh,  who? \n\n{ts:2307} >> Still  36. \n >> I  think  McVey  was  like  like  early  30s\n{ts:2311} \n cuz  he  was  younger. \n\n{ts:2312} >> I  think  he  was  34. \n >> Yeah.\n{ts:2313} \n >> How  old  Wait,  how  old  are  you? \n\n{ts:2315} >> 38. \n >> Never  mind.  36  is  old  as  hell.\n{ts:2317} \n >> Yeah,  it  is.  It  is. \n\n{ts:2320} >> Depends  on  the  mileage,  too.  Yeah. \n >> Um,  who's  going  to  win  the  Super  Bowl?\n{ts:2325} \n >> Wow. \n\n{ts:2327} >> I  feel  like  teams  just  get  hot.  Like \n this  year  the  Rams  were  really  good.\n{ts:2331} \n They  almost  got  beat  by \n\n{ts:2333} >> um  the  other  day  who  they  almost  get \n beat  by  uh  the  Panthers  who  were  eight\n{ts:2337} \n and  nine  and  made  the  playoffs. \n\n{ts:2339} >> Yeah.  No  one  is  exceptionally  good. \n >> Nobody's  just\n{ts:2342} \n >> I  thought  the  Bills  were  going  to  run \n\n{ts:2343} away  with  it  and  then  they  almost  got \n beat  by  Jacksonville.  Jacksonville  got\n{ts:2345} \n hot.  I  guess  Carolina  got  hot  too,  but \n\n{ts:2348} it's  Man,  it's  just  all  about  momentum \n right  now.  I  would  say  the  Bills  would\n{ts:2351} \n be  the \n\n{ts:2351} >> I  would  like  for  the  my  like  heart  is \n with  the  Bills  probably.\n{ts:2355} \n >> I  would  say  so  too.  Their  fan  base \n\n{ts:2357} deserves. \n >> I  like  Josh  Allen.  Seems  like  a good\n{ts:2358} \n dude. \n\n{ts:2359} >> My  neighbor  is  a  Bills  fan. \n >> They're  fromuffalo.\n{ts:2361} \n >> Buffalo.  You  know,  the  kids  always  like \n\n{ts:2362} when  they  the  Buffalo  Bills  are  on. \n >> Mike  Tomlin  never  had  a  losing  season.\n{ts:2368} \n >> No.  Wow. \n\n{ts:2369} >> Are  you  San  Francisco? \n >> We  are.\n{ts:2371} \n >> It's  just  where  the  kids  grew  up.  So  it \n\n{ts:2373} was  like  our  it  was  their  first  team, \n you  know.\n{ts:2375} \n >> Yeah. \n\n{ts:2375} >> I  like  them.  I  like  Brock  Pury,  so  I \n like  them.\n{ts:2378} \n >> Yeah.  Yeah,  KD  got  hurt. \n\n{ts:2379} >> ACL.  I  mean,  uh,  Achilles,  huh? \n >> Everybody  Achilles.\n{ts:2383} \n >> Oh,  yeah.  I  was  watch  Didn't  I  watch \n\n{ts:2384} that  with  you? \n >> We  watched  it  in  the\n{ts:2386} \n >> office.  That's  right. \n\n{ts:2387} >> We  have  TVs  in  our  offices  now. \n >> Oh,  yeah.\n{ts:2390} \n >> Have  sports  going. \n\n{ts:2391} >> Those  football  players  should  have  um \n paid  more  attention  to  Hiller's  videos.\n{ts:2396} \n >> Rebounding  box. \n\n{ts:2396} >> Yeah,  everybody  should  watch  Hiller's \n videos\n{ts:2398} \n >> than  they  could  have  not  torn  their \n\n{ts:2400} Achilles. \n >> More  rebounding  box  jumps.  That's  for\n{ts:2402} \n sure.  That's  what  they're  missing. \n\n{ts:2405} My  my  knees  still  hurt  from  rebounding \n box.\n{ts:2408} \n >> Yeah, \n\n{ts:2409} >> that's  how  I  screwed  my  knee  up,  dude.  I \n got  ACL  surgery,  got  the  miniscus\n{ts:2412} \n repair,  and  I  was  doing  fantastic.  And \n\n{ts:2414} it  was  literally  the  last  day  before  I \n was  fully  cleared  hot.  Like  10  seconds\n{ts:2418} \n left  in  the  workout.  I  was  stepping  down \n\n{ts:2419} my  box  jumps  and  I  was  like,  you  know \n what?  Uh\n{ts:2422} \n >> maybe  I'll  just  go  for  click  click.  And \n\n{ts:2425} uh  I've  never  been  the  same  since. \n >> It's  not  always  the  last  rep,  but  it\n{ts:2429} \n usually  is  the  last  rep. \n\n{ts:2432} >> It  usually  is  the  last  It  wasn't  meant \n to  be  the  last  round,\n{ts:2435} \n >> but  it  usually  is. \n\n{ts:2436} >> Yep.  Mine  was  the  last  10  double  unders \n of  heavy  double  unders  in  a  workout  that\n{ts:2440} \n got  my  meniscus. \n\n{ts:2441} >> This  is  probably  a  stupid  question.  Did \n you  go  I  was  programmed  for  Mayhem\n{ts:2444} \n athlete.  Did  you  go  back  and  do  13.5? \n\n{ts:2446} >> Hell  no, \n >> bro.  It  had  been  a  minute  since  I\n{ts:2448} \n watched  that \n\n{ts:2449} >> you  dudes.  It  was  before  it  was  before \n grips  and  knee  sleeves.\n{ts:2453} \n >> Yeah, \n\n{ts:2453} >> that's  what  really  jumped  out  to  me.  I \n was  like,\n{ts:2455} \n >> I  can't  believe  he's  doing  all  these \n\n{ts:2457} pull-ups. \n >> Yeah.  I  don't\n{ts:2458} \n >> It  was  in  a  time  before  grips. \n\n{ts:2460} >> You  were  just  raw  dogging  it.  And  then \n every  once  in  a  while  you  like  bite  bite\n{ts:2463} \n off  the  you  know  what  I  mean?  Like  when \n\n{ts:2464} you'd  have  a  callus  bite  off  a  piece  of \n skin.\n{ts:2467} \n >> Yeah.  You  guys  were  bare-handed. \n\n{ts:2468} >> Oh  gosh. \n >> And\n{ts:2470} \n >> did  a  lot  of  kipping  pull-ups  at  the \n\n{ts:2471} end. \n >> Yeah.  That  was  the  only  time  Dave's  ever\n{ts:2474} \n asked  me  if  I  was  okay  in  anything. \n\n{ts:2476} >> And  knowing  that  now  watching  it  back,  I \n was\n{ts:2478} \n >> Yeah.  When  he  goes  over  to  me  and  goes, \n\n{ts:2480} \"Hey,  are  you  okay? \n >> You  don't  have  to  keep  going.\"  And  I  I\n{ts:2485} \n think  you  can  kind  of  see  my  reaction  to \n\n{ts:2486} him \n >> cuz  you  had  started  the  next  round  and\n{ts:2488} \n Kipa  didn't  even  make  it.  So  you're  all \n\n{ts:2490} by  yourself. \n >> All  by  myself.  I  remember\n{ts:2492} \n >> by  a  buzzer  beater.  It  was  a  great  That \n\n{ts:2494} was  a  great  event,  man.  Great  event. \n >> Yeah.  Yeah.  You  just  barely  made  it  and\n{ts:2498} \n you're  like  all \n\n{ts:2498} >> Did  he  make  it?  Did  he  not  do  Oh \n >> yeah.  Yeah.  You  wander  over  the  bar\n{ts:2502} \n finally. \n\n{ts:2504} >> Yeah. \n >> And  still  whether  you  practiced  it  or\n{ts:2506} \n not,  dude.  Like  at  the  end  of  time  like \n\n{ts:2507} you  still  you  gave  it  a  fist  pump  or \n like  I  just  did  burpees  and  rowing  this\n{ts:2511} \n morning  and  I'm  like  you  I  couldn't  have \n\n{ts:2512} fist  pumped  at  the  end  of  that  thing  to \n paid  me  a  million  dollars.\n{ts:2516} \n >> No,  we  did  not.  We  did  the  Mayhem \n\n{ts:2517} athlete  group  workout  version. \n They  went  one  to  one,  21  thrusters,  21\n{ts:2524} \n chest  to  bar,  one  to  one  for  six  sets.  I \n\n{ts:2526} did  21  overhead  squats  and  21  toes  to \n bar.\n{ts:2529} \n >> Okay. \n\n{ts:2530} >> With  Jorge  back  and  forth. \n >> It  was  what  I  needed.  Chest  to  bar,  man.\n{ts:2535} \n Thruster  one,  my  front  rack  is  terrible \n\n{ts:2537} and  it  bugs  my  knee  because  I  have  to \n get  so  far  forward.  Um,  and  then  I  don't\n{ts:2542} \n chest  a  bar.  I  don't  kipping.  I  do  a  lot \n\n{ts:2544} of  pull-ups.  I  just  do  them  strict \n mostly.\n{ts:2547} \n >> My  shoulders  just  don't  like  it.  Yeah, \n\n{ts:2549} they're  fine  if  I  warm  up  correctly  and \n I  take  my  time  and  everything,  but  then\n{ts:2552} \n I  am  so  sore. \n\n{ts:2554} >> If  you're  trying  to  compete,  you  need  to \n do  them.  But  if  you  don't,  if  you're  not\n{ts:2557} \n trying  to  compete, \n\n{ts:2559} >> I  lean  more  towards  the  the  the  way  of \n strict  in  training  and  then  if  you're\n{ts:2564} \n about  to  do  a  competition  and  you  know \n\n{ts:2566} they  might  come  up  or  before  the  open  a \n couple  weeks  out,  I  can  get  the  I  can\n{ts:2569} \n get  the  pattern  down  and  be  fine. \n\n{ts:2571} >> The  pattern  is  fine.  It's  just  it's  more \n of  just  the  volume\n{ts:2573} \n >> like  doing  like  some  tens  and  then  some \n\n{ts:2575} 15s  and  maybe  some  20s  and  then  you're \n good  to  get\n{ts:2579} \n >> to  fives  and  it's  and  if  you  can  limit \n\n{ts:2581} your  rest  it's  fine. \n >> Yeah.  Yeah.  You  can  build  the  volume.\n{ts:2584} \n Yeah.  We  were  um  Darren  had  me  do  a \n\n{ts:2585} workout  a  long  time  ago.  Uh  obviously  it \n was  like  a  30  second  window  you  would  do\n{ts:2590} \n 10  chest  to  bar  and  the  next  30  second \n\n{ts:2592} window  you  do  eight  chest  to  bar  and  the \n next  30  second  window  you  do  six  and\n{ts:2596} \n then  you  go  back  to  10  86  10  86.  You  do \n\n{ts:2598} that  for  four  or  five  rounds  or \n something.  And  that  way  you're  never\n{ts:2601} \n doing  a  bigger  set  set  bigger  than  10, \n\n{ts:2603} but  you're  accumulating  some  good \n volume.  Me  and  I  think  Paige  did  that\n{ts:2606} \n not  that  long  ago. \n\n{ts:2607} >> 24. \n >> Yeah.  90  seconds.  Like  it's  not  crazy.\n{ts:2609} \n And  you  do  three  you  can  do  like  three \n\n{ts:2610} sets  of  it  and  it's  just  just  for \n volume.  And  then  you  can  go  like  five  or\n{ts:2613} \n six  and  accumulate  some  more. \n\n{ts:2615} >> Um  yeah,  some  bilateral  upper  body \n >> posterior  pulling.\n{ts:2622} \n >> Posterior  pulling. \n\n{ts:2624} >> Gosh.  where  I've  gotten  into  the  last \n couple  weeks  getting  back  in  the  rhythm\n{ts:2629} \n of  helping  them  with  compete.  We  did  it \n\n{ts:2630} a  lot  this  summer  for  a  couple  weeks  and \n then  with  we  traveled  so  much  this  fall.\n{ts:2635} \n um  Lockard's  been  doing  it  and  then  you \n\n{ts:2637} guys  kind  of  do  it  as  committee  and  so \n I've  gotten  more  involved  and  we  walk  in\n{ts:2641} \n there  and  we're  trying  to  like  write \n\n{ts:2642} workouts  like  you  know what  that's  a  lot \n of  posterior  pulling  from  blah  blah  like\n{ts:2647} \n I'm  like  so  they're  deadlifting  you  know \n\n{ts:2650} like  are  they  pulling  from  the  floor  and \n so  yeah  they  want  to  like  throw  out  all\n{ts:2654} \n these  terms  and  I'm  like  okay \n\n{ts:2657} >> it's  not  church  it  up  dirt \n >> I  said  if\n{ts:2659} \n >> you're  going  to  love  that  spreadsheet \n\n{ts:2660} >> oh  gosh  I  I  love  spreadsheets \n >> I  do  I  do  like  a  good  spreadsheet.  It\n{ts:2665} \n just  like  it  just  I  don't  know.  I  can \n\n{ts:2668} paint  the  picture  really  well  for  myself \n now  cuz  like  if  I  have  two  monitors  up\n{ts:2671} \n basically  what  you're  saying  about \n\n{ts:2672} having  the  one  week  and  the  other  week  I \n can  have  two  monitors  up  and  like  I  can\n{ts:2675} \n see  what's  going  what  I  did  this  week \n\n{ts:2677} and  I  can  see  what  I'm  going  to  do  the \n next  week  or  like  I  can  see  this  month.\n{ts:2679} \n >> Well,  I  mean  I  guess  I  should  preface \n\n{ts:2681} with  I  don't  own  a  computer. \n >> Yeah.\n{ts:2683} \n >> I  mean  I  guess  I  own  a  lot  of  computers \n\n{ts:2685} but  I  don't  personally  have  my  own \n computer.\n{ts:2687} \n >> Yeah,  you've  signed  them. \n\n{ts:2688} >> Yep.  Um,  my  dog  tore  ACL  yesterday,  so \n she's  joining  the  crew.\n{ts:2694} \n >> She  in  s  when  are  you  guys  having \n\n{ts:2697} surgery? \n >> I  don't  know.  Bird  told  me  to  shoot  her.\n{ts:2700} \n I  said  that's  not  an  option. \n\n{ts:2704} >> He  goes,  \"I'll  save  you  a  lot  of  money.\" \n I  said, \"That's  not  an  option.\"\n{ts:2706} \n >> He  hates  pets.  He  hated \n\n{ts:2708} >> Yeah,  he  does.  He's  like  one  of  those \n guys  you  can't  trust  cuz  if  you  don't\n{ts:2711} \n like  dogs,  then  you  can't  be  trusted. \n\n{ts:2712} >> Yeah.  He  said  they're  He  basically  said \n they're  a  waste  of  time  and  money.\n{ts:2715} \n >> He's \n\n{ts:2717} He's  wrong.  Yeah.  I  was  supposed  to  say \n he's  not  wrong,  but  he's\n{ts:2720} \n >> uh  So,  I  mean,  she's  like \n\n{ts:2722} >> It  makes  me  think  though  every  time  like \n I'm  always  like,  I'm  going to  do  that\n{ts:2724} \n pet  insurance. \n\n{ts:2725} >> Yeah. \n >> And  then  I  never  do,  but  it  would  be\n{ts:2727} \n >> No.  Gipper,  man.  Gipper  had  we  had \n\n{ts:2728} Gipper  for  maybe  a  year  and  he  had  to \n have  shoulder  surgery.  It  was  like\n{ts:2732} \n $2,700. \n\n{ts:2734} And  that  dog \n >> for  seven  years  was  the  vein  of  my\n{ts:2738} \n existence.  Like  dogs  are  supposed  to  add \n\n{ts:2740} value  to  your  life.  That  dog  took  a \n piece  of  my  life  every  single  day.  He's\n{ts:2744} \n 12  now.  So,  at  about  eight  or  nine,  he \n\n{ts:2746} started  to  slow  down.  He  still  has  these \n weird  quirks,  man.  Like  he  gets  fixated\n{ts:2751} \n on  one.  He's  He's  got  some  like  OCD. \n\n{ts:2755} >> Yeah,  for  sure. \n >> Some  type  of  acronym  for  something  else,\n{ts:2758} \n too.  Like  he  is \n\n{ts:2759} >> a  [\u00a0__\u00a0] \n >> And  luckily  now  he's  just  too  old  to\n{ts:2763} \n like  stay  too  fixated  on  something. \n\n{ts:2767} >> He's  got  those  like  bug  eyes  and  they're \n on  his  head  and  they're  looking  two\n{ts:2769} \n different  directions. \n\n{ts:2771} >> He  comes  up  to  you  and  it's  just  like \n >> And  luckily,  you  know,  in  the  last  four\n{ts:2774} \n or  five  years,  he's  slowed  down  a  bunch. \n\n{ts:2775} But  those  first  seven  years,  man,  I \n every  every  rock  obsession  was\n{ts:2779} \n >> every  single  day  I  wanted  to  like  end \n\n{ts:2782} it. \n >> Still,\n{ts:2783} \n >> the  rock  obsession  was  annoying  cuz  like \n\n{ts:2785} it  was  ball.  Well,  he \n >> Well,  he  couldn't  I  can't  give  him  a\n{ts:2787} \n ball  because  he  just  sit  there  and  chew \n\n{ts:2789} it  or  fixate  on  it  and  then  he'll \n swallow  it  and  in  the  middle  of  the\n{ts:2791} \n night  he  finds  the  only  carpet  or  rug  in \n\n{ts:2793} our  house  and  pukes  on  it. \n >> He  ate  a  lacrosse  ball  one  time  up  here.\n{ts:2796} \n >> Yes. \n\n{ts:2797} >> Yeah. \n >> He  just  sits  in  like  a  morning  like  a\n{ts:2799} \n morning  session.  And  what  I  guess  what \n\n{ts:2800} sucks  too  is  like \n >> we  had  Gilligan  which  Gilligan  was\n{ts:2803} \n literally  the  best  dog  ever. \n\n{ts:2806} >> And  then  we  got  Gipper. \n >> Gipper.\n{ts:2807} \n >> Gosh. \n\n{ts:2808} >> He  had  big  shoes  to  film. \n >> Yeah.\n{ts:2810} \n >> Uh \n\n{ts:2811} >> sorry  I  just  derailed  you. \n >> Oh,  you're  good.  Yeah,  she  tore  ACL.\n{ts:2814} \n It's  going  to  cost  me  a  lot  of  money. \n\n{ts:2815} I'm  really  excited  about  him. \n >> Dogs  have  only  have  ACL's  in  the  rear?\n{ts:2820} \n >> Uh  she  it's  not  even  really  I  think  it's \n\n{ts:2822} not  technically  an  ACL.  It's  very  but  it \n functions  the  same  way  as  it's  like  a\n{ts:2826} \n CCL  I  think  is  what  it's  called. \n\n{ts:2827} Functions  the  same  way.  I  don't  know. \n back.\n{ts:2828} \n >> It's  her  back  leg.  It's  her  back  leg. \n\n{ts:2830} Yeah.  She  like  the  vet  like  took  it  and \n she  could  like  move  it  back  and  forth.\n{ts:2834} \n She's  like,  \"Yeah,  I  think  she  tore  her \n\n{ts:2835} ACL.\"  Like  it's  pretty  obvious,  but \n she's  like,  \"You  see  like  you  can't\n{ts:2839} \n You're  not  along  just  fine.  I  get  along \n\n{ts:2842} just  fine  without  an  ACL.  She'll  be  all \n right.\"\n{ts:2843} \n >> I  know.  Well,  like  our  other  dog  tore \n\n{ts:2845} her  ACL.  I  don't  know how  old  she  was, \n but  she  tore  her  ACL.  And  she's  lazy,\n{ts:2850} \n though.  And  so,  they  just  basically  give \n\n{ts:2851} her  pain  meds  and  anti-inflammatories, \n and  she  rehabbed  it.  She  just  waited  a\n{ts:2856} \n long  time  until  it  was  better.  And  now \n\n{ts:2858} she's  fine.  But  this  dog  is  wild.  Bill. \n >> Yeah.  I  mean,  she  she  tore  it  jumping\n{ts:2863} \n over  dog  crates.  She's  like  just  running \n\n{ts:2865} and  jumping  over  dog  crates.  And  my \n mother-in-law  saw  her  and  she's  like,\n{ts:2869} \n \"Uh,  she's  walking  with  three  legs  right \n\n{ts:2870} now.  It's  probably  not  good.\" \n >> Yeah.  So,  Malola  said,  \"I  should  just\n{ts:2876} \n cut  it  off.\"  I  go,  \"You  think  cutting  it \n\n{ts:2877} off  would  be  any  cheaper?\"  I  don't  think \n it'd  be  any  cheaper.\n{ts:2880} \n >> That's  what  happened  with  Mufasa,  dad's \n\n{ts:2882} dog.  He  got  shot.  Actually, \n >> somebody  thought  he  was  a  coyote  and\n{ts:2885} \n shot  his  back  foot.  And  so  instead  of \n\n{ts:2888} like  dad  taking  it  and  getting  it  with \n the  vet  stitched  up  and  having  to  take\n{ts:2893} \n it  back  multiple  times,  he's  like  just \n\n{ts:2894} take  it  off. \n >> And  Mufasa  ran  around  for  he  was  fast,\n{ts:2897} \n too. \n\n{ts:2898} >> Yeah. \n >> So,\n{ts:2899} \n >> do  do  we  know  the  person  who  shot  him  in \n\n{ts:2900} the  foot? \n >> I  think  it  was  either  a  really  lucky\n{ts:2902} \n shot  or \n\n{ts:2902} >> I  think  it  was  a  neighbor.  I  think  it \n was  a  really  bad  shot.\n{ts:2904} \n >> Really  bad  shot. \n\n{ts:2905} >> Yeah. \n >> Um,  you  guys  want  some  Mayhem  Classic\n{ts:2909} \n hot  off  the  presses  news?  Just  hit  my \n\n{ts:2910} watch. \n >> Sure.\n{ts:2911} \n >> Patner  and  Jay  Crouch  are  unable  to  make \n\n{ts:2914} the  competition.  They  have  cordially \n cordially  declined  COVID  restrictions.\n{ts:2922} \n >> Um,  how  how  is  440  going  for \n\n{ts:2926} >> Yeah,  your  resolution,  huh?  The  No, \n you're  like  a  cold  turkey  type  guy,\n{ts:2931} \n right?  Alcohol  you've  been  cold  turkey \n\n{ts:2933} on  for  since  2020. \n So,  whatever.\n{ts:2937} \n >> Six  years.  Just  kidding.  Just  past  Yeah. \n\n{ts:2939} Past  five  years. \n >> Yeah.  All  of  all  of  20.\n{ts:2944} \n >> You  was  was  no \n\n{ts:2945} >> sixth.  Then  all  then  six  years. \n >> I'm  entering  my  sixth  year.\n{ts:2947} \n >> Entering  your  sixth  year. \n\n{ts:2948} >> You're  entering  your  seventh. \n >> Entering.\n{ts:2949} \n >> All  of  2020. \n\n{ts:2950} >> 2020.  1  2  3  4. \n >> Yeah,  you're  right.  Zero.  That's  a  zero\n{ts:2955} \n there.  Huh. \n\n{ts:2956} >> Um \n >> I  just  did  on  my  fingers  too  when  you\n{ts:2958} \n guys. \n\n{ts:2958} >> So  yeah.  Uh  well,  it's  really  the  21 \n days  of  prayer  and  fasting\n{ts:2963} \n >> fits  nicely  with  the  440.  But  uh  yeah, \n\n{ts:2966} nicotine.  Had  to  say  bye-bye.  I  just \n don't  do  anything  halfway,  man.  You\n{ts:2969} \n think  you're  going  to \n\n{ts:2970} >> your  laps \n >> cold  turkey  on  it  done?\n{ts:2972} \n >> There's  no  no  space  for  it to  my  lips. \n\n{ts:2974} >> Find  any  of  those.  The  ones  that  been \n >> the  fake  stuff  like  that's  neutropics\n{ts:2977} \n and  stuff  are  great. \n\n{ts:2977} >> Yeah.  So  you've  been  doing  Yeah.  So  it's \n not  a  lip.  You  didn't  fast  anything  on\n{ts:2982} \n the  lip.  It's  just  nicotine. \n\n{ts:2984} >> Yes. \n >> Yeah.\n{ts:2985} \n >> Yeah.  Man  something  you  put  on  your  lip. \n\n{ts:2987} >> I  think  I  I  think  I  just  like  the  uh \n I've  never  dipped,  never  had  that  rhythm\n{ts:2992} \n and  I  can't  do  nicotine.  It  makes  me  and \n\n{ts:2994} Scott  tried  it  one  time  before  a \n meeting,  the  gum,  and  it  was  the  most\n{ts:2998} \n worthless  meeting  I've  ever  been  a  part \n\n{ts:3000} of.  I  think  it \n >> say  he's  more  focused  without  it,  which\n{ts:3003} \n is  crazy  because  I  thought  it  was \n\n{ts:3004} supposed  to  help  you  focus,  not  me.  It \n doesn't  help  me.\n{ts:3006} \n >> Again,  like  there's  there's  an  effective \n\n{ts:3008} dose  and  then  there's  like  like  you  were \n talking  about  your  lethal  dose  of  Fanta\n{ts:3011} \n or  whatever  the  hell  you're  talking \n\n{ts:3012} about. \n >> Fresco.  Yeah.\n{ts:3012} \n >> Fresco. \n\n{ts:3013} >> Um,  right.  Like  the  same  thing  with  like \n the  amount  of  caffeine  in  that  and  then\n{ts:3016} \n once  you  overdo  it,  I  think  you're  going \n\n{ts:3018} down. \n >> And  I  had  so  little  one  milligram  if\n{ts:3021} \n that.  We  had  half  of  it  and  I  didn't \n\n{ts:3023} even  you  couldn't  even  feel  it  in  your \n mouth.  The  gum  was  so  small  and  I\n{ts:3027} \n couldn't  even  see  straight.  I  could \n\n{ts:3028} >> Me  and  Scott  are  just  like  yelling \n ideas.  You  remember  that  meeting,  right?\n{ts:3031} \n >> Yes.  Yes. \n\n{ts:3033} >> Podcast  around  that  time,  too. \n >> Maybe.  I  don't  know.  And  I  was  And  I  was\n{ts:3036} \n not  drinking  at  the  time.  So,  I'm  like, \n\n{ts:3037} \"Yeah,  I'm  going to  like  it.\" \n >> It  was  like  so  little  gum.  You  know,\n{ts:3039} \n when  you  chew  gum  for  too  long  and  it \n\n{ts:3041} turn  like  a  piece  breaks  off  and  then \n that  little  piece  is  like  it  feels  like\n{ts:3044} \n food  in  your  mouth \n\n{ts:3045} >> and  it  just  disintegrates. \n >> Yeah.  That's  how  small  that  piece  of  gum\n{ts:3048} \n was. \n\n{ts:3049} >> I  just  I  can't  do  it,  man.  And  so  I've \n just  never  gotten  into  you're  lucky.  I  I\n{ts:3053} \n listened  to  uh  KStar  published  a  little \n\n{ts:3056} sound  bite  recently  and  like  I  got \n bamboozled,  you  know,  because  there  were\n{ts:3059} \n a  couple  of  healthy  and  Yeah. \n\n{ts:3061} >> Well,  yeah,  but  at  like  1.5  milligrams \n like  you  can't  even  buy  that,  you  know,\n{ts:3065} \n >> and  so  yeah,  once  by  the  time  I  was \n\n{ts:3067} doing  god  knows  how  many  milligrams  in  a \n day,  I  was  like, \"Yeah,  this  is  the\n{ts:3070} \n opposite  of  healthy.  It's  bad  example \n\n{ts:3072} for  my  kids.\"  I'm  a  coach  at  the \n lacrosse  for  the  high  school.

And  I  don't  know if  it  actually\n{ts:3083} \n does  anything.  I  just  like  having  It's \n\n{ts:3084} like  gum.

And  so  I  was  just \n\n{ts:3196} doing  some  windmills  like  dumbbell  up, \n dumbbell  down.\n{ts:3199} \n >> Yeah. \n\n{ts:3199} >> Some  just  I  have  to  do  it.  And  uh  he  did \n not  like  that.  And  then  throwing  a\n{ts:3203} \n medball  over  the  rig.  He  was  he  was  uh \n\n{ts:3206} the  accuracy  piece  was  a  little  off. \n >> A  little  off.\n{ts:3208} \n >> Yeah.  Not  until  the  end.  I  think  that \n\n{ts:3210} was  that  was  a  little  fatigued,  right? \n Like\n{ts:3211} \n >> no. \n\n{ts:3212} >> No.  No.  That  was  You  saw  the  good  side. \n >> Okay.\n{ts:3216} \n It  looked  like  it  just  looked  like  you \n\n{ts:3218} were  late  in  the  game. \n >> I'm  thinking  okay,  you  know,  I'm  going\n{ts:3220} \n to  get  the  rotation  of  throwing  it  and \n\n{ts:3222} then  the  rotation  like  the  deceleration. \n >> I'm  catching  it,  but  you're  chasing  it.\n{ts:3225} \n But  I  was  like  bounce  bounce,  you  know, \n\n{ts:3227} whatever. \n >> It  was  more  reaction  time  than\n{ts:3230} \n >> Yeah, \n\n{ts:3230} >> the  del. \n >> Uh  we  got  another  coach's  development\n{ts:3235} \n weekend  coming  up  next  month.  That's \n\n{ts:3236} exciting. \n >> February  20  weekend  under  the  20th.  So  I\n{ts:3240} \n think  it's  202122. \n\n{ts:3242} Um,  and  then  we're  10  weeks  deep  with \n the  uh  NC  FIT  crew  coming  over  to\n{ts:3245} \n Mayhem,  which  is  awesome.  So,  um, \n\n{ts:3248} >> not  all  sunshine  and  roses,  just  a  lot \n of  a  lot  of  great  feedback,  right?  It's\n{ts:3251} \n cool  to  have, \n\n{ts:3253} >> as  like  I  was  saying  to  you  the  other \n day  with  the  coaches  notes,  it's  a  world\n{ts:3256} \n that  I  can  only  imagine  being  a  early \n\n{ts:3258} coach  and  having  those  kind  of \n resources,  but  there  is  there's  some  art\n{ts:3261} \n to  how  you  lay  it  out  and  the  NC  fit \n\n{ts:3264} folks  are  used  to  a  certain  way.  So,  um, \n trying  to  was  grown  in  just  Darren\n{ts:3269} \n needed  something  to  do  and  it  was  just \n\n{ts:3271} programming. \n >> Well,  and  to  be  fair,  like  his  his  are\n{ts:3273} \n great. \n\n{ts:3273} >> Yeah.  Great. \n >> It's  not  and  and  I  was  having  this\n{ts:3275} \n conversation  with  a  bunch  of  people \n\n{ts:3276} where  it's  like \n >> there's  no  right  answer,  right?  There's\n{ts:3279} \n but  there's  definitely \n\n{ts:3281} >> making  it  as  elegant  as  possible  to \n where  it's,  you  know,  as  plug  as  play  as\n{ts:3285} \n possible,  but  also  fits  our,  hey,  you're \n\n{ts:3287} going  to  have  to  own  your  own \n programming  to  some  degree  because  all\n{ts:3290} \n these  communities  are  different.  But \n\n{ts:3292} yeah,  it's  been  really  cool  to  to  plug \n into  that,  try  and  take  their  feedback,\n{ts:3297} \n make  sure  that  that  we  can  serve  them \n\n{ts:3298} really  well.  Um,  and  overall  making  the \n product  a  lot  better.  So  yeah,  man,  it's\n{ts:3302} \n been  it's  been  stimulating  working  with \n\n{ts:3304} coaches,  gym  owners,  that  kind  of  thing. \n Um,  but  yeah,  if  people  are  interested\n{ts:3310} \n this  time,  what's  cool,  there's  no \n\n{ts:3312} restrictions.  So  if  you  want  to  bring \n your  team  out,  you  can  bring  your  team\n{ts:3314} \n out.  If  you  want  to  buy  whatever,  buy  20 \n\n{ts:3316} tickets,  you  can  buy  20  tickets  and \n come.  Last  time  it  was  you  and  a  plus\n{ts:3320} \n one.  Uh,  so  I  think  it'd  be  cool  to  have \n\n{ts:3322} like  full  teams  come  out  where  you're \n you  got  the  owner  coach.\n{ts:3325} \n >> Oh,  yeah. \n\n{ts:3326} >> Or  coaches,  manager,  whatever.  Uh,  get \n some  more  interaction  for  like\n{ts:3330} \n >> or  coaches. \n\n{ts:3331} >> Or  coaches.  Thank  you. \n >> Um,  yeah.  And  then  we're  we  got  to  pack\n{ts:3335} \n for  it's  going  to  be  very  very  cold  in \n\n{ts:3337} Sweden. \n >> Is  it?\n{ts:3338} \n >> Yeah. \n\n{ts:3339} >> That  sucks.  We're  only  there  for  like  36 \n hours.\n{ts:3343} \n >> No,  we're  there  for  you're  not  wrong. \n\n{ts:3345} >> We're  not  there  for  long.  We  get  to \n Sweden  I  think  Friday.\n{ts:3348} \n >> 72.  We  get  to  Sweden  at  2:30  or \n\n{ts:3352} something.  Friday  and  then  we  leave \n Sunday  morning  at  or  Monday  morning.\n{ts:3356} \n Monday  morning,  right? \n\n{ts:3357} >> 7  a.m. \n >> Right.  Okay.  The  event  finishes  Sunday\n{ts:3360} \n afternoon.  And  the \n\n{ts:3361} >> go  let  Darren  see  some  things.  I've \n never  been  to  Sweden  actually.\n{ts:3364} \n >> I've  been  to  Sweden.  I've  never  been  to \n\n{ts:3365} Stockholm. \n >> Kundo  was  uh  he  was  like,  \"You're  not\n{ts:3368} \n going  to  want  to  do  anything  uh  Sunday \n\n{ts:3371} or  whatever.\"  I  was  like  I  was  like, \n \"What  else?\"  He  said,  \"What?\"  He  said  he\n{ts:3374} \n said  it  gets  dark.  He  said  it  gets  dark \n\n{ts:3376} early.  So  dark.  He  was  like  aggressively \n saying  how  dark  it  gets.\n{ts:3380} \n >> He  did  say  I  was \n\n{ts:3380} >> like,  \"What's  going  on?\" \n >> Yeah.\n{ts:3382} \n >> Is  it  Is  it  more  dark  than  here  at \n\n{ts:3383} night? \n >> Yeah.  More  dark  than  normal  nighttime.\n{ts:3387} \n >> That's  right.  Yeah.  It's  It's  pretty  far \n\n{ts:3388} up  there. \n >> So  dark.  So  So  so so  dark.  Very  dark.\n{ts:3392} \n >> Yeah. \n\n{ts:3392} >> Super  dark. \n >> The  darkest.  The  most  dark.  Um\n{ts:3397} \n actually  I  am  a  couple  days  into  no \n\n{ts:3402} whoop. \n >> Mhm.\n{ts:3403} \n >> Oh  yeah.  Yeah. \n\n{ts:3404} >> I'm  a  couple  days  back  in \n >> naked.\n{ts:3405} \n >> Uh  yeah.  It  feels  weird,  you  know,  like \n\n{ts:3408} I  was  getting  some  weird  burns \n >> from  the  white.  Uh  I  would  have  to\n{ts:3413} \n rotate  wrists,  which  you  should  probably \n\n{ts:3414} do  anyway.  Um \n >> and  you  know,  they  they  paid  us  for  a\n{ts:3418} \n long  time  and  we're  great.  Even  you \n\n{ts:3420} know,  I  used  it. \n >> Um\n{ts:3423} \n >> I  think  I  had  like  a  five  or  six  year \n\n{ts:3424} streak \n >> and  then  I  think  for  the  last  year  or  so\n{ts:3427} \n I've  just  been  doing  it  and  I  didn't  get \n\n{ts:3428} the  new  one.  and  I  just  have  the  four \n >> and  a  new  one.  The  other  day  my  band\n{ts:3433} \n broke  and  I  was  like,  \"All  right,  guess \n\n{ts:3436} it's  time.\"  So,  I'm  not  I  think  I'm  like \n four  or  five  days  clean  and  I  still  on\n{ts:3441} \n my  phone  go  to  the  Whoop  app  and  I'm \n\n{ts:3442} like  or  I  finish  a  workout  and  I'm  like, \n \"Let  me  see\n{ts:3444} \n >> let's  see  the  strains  app.\" \n\n{ts:3445} >> And  I'm  like,  \"Oh,  no,  I  don't  have  it.\" \n So,  I  bought  it's  called  fit  fit  sleep\n{ts:3449} \n or  fit  sleeps  and  it's  because  the  one \n\n{ts:3453} thing  I  I  did  use  Whoop  and  the  metrics \n and  I  didn't  really  like  move  my\n{ts:3457} \n training  around  but  it  was  a  good  thing \n\n{ts:3459} to  like  look  at  to  see  like  the  trends \n or  whatever  and  check  my  recovery  and\n{ts:3464} \n sleep.  But  the  thing  I  loved  the  most \n\n{ts:3469} was  the  silent  alarm.  Yeah. \n >> So,  um,  this  Fit  Sleep  thing,  you  just\n{ts:3473} \n buy  it  and  it's  no  subscription \n\n{ts:3476} >> and  it  just  vibrates  on  your  wrist.  It's \n You  put  it  on  at  night,  go  to  sleep  in\n{ts:3479} \n it. \n\n{ts:3480} >> And  guess  what? \n >> It  has  a  button.  You  can  see  the  time.\n{ts:3485} \n >> Ooh,  genius. \n\n{ts:3486} >> Yeah. \n >> Nice.\n{ts:3488} \n >> I  mean,  it's  like  a  calorie  counter  step \n\n{ts:3490} thing.  I'm  not  wearing  it  throughout  the \n day  cuz  I  don't  care.  It  doesn't  have\n{ts:3493} \n like  a  interface  on  the  app.  It's \n\n{ts:3495} literally  just  But  you  push  you  push  a \n button\n{ts:3498} \n >> and  it's  like  super  thin  and  like \n\n{ts:3501} whatever  and  it  not  even  a  like  it  it \n it's  weird.  I'll  have  to  show  it  to  you.\n{ts:3504} \n It  has  the  time. \n\n{ts:3506} >> The  only  thing \n >> cuz  it's  so  nice  in  the  middle  of  the\n{ts:3508} \n night  when  you  get  up  to  piss  and  you're \n\n{ts:3509} like,  \"How  much  time  do  I  have  left  to \n sleep?\"\n{ts:3511} \n >> And  you're  like,  \"Oh,  I  can  look.\"  And \n\n{ts:3514} dude,  it's  it's  like  revolutionary  that \n you  can  look  at  the  time  on  your,  you\n{ts:3519} \n know,  I've  thought  about  I'm  like,  \"God, \n\n{ts:3520} maybe  I'll  go  back  to  Apple  Watch.  Maybe \n I'll  go  back  to  Garmin.\"  And  I  think  for\n{ts:3525} \n training  for  the  Iron  Man, \n\n{ts:3526} >> you  definitely  need  a  Garmin  to  train \n for  an Iron  Man.\n{ts:3528} \n >> I  don't know  if  I  want  the  Garmin,  man. \n\n{ts:3529} They're  so  big  and  bulky,  man.  That  was \n the  one%  I  liked  about\n{ts:3533} \n >> someone  stand  with  me  please. \n\n{ts:3535} >> Um \n >> I  don't  know.\n{ts:3537} \n >> This  one's  mine's  really \n\n{ts:3539} for  example  though.  You  could  still  just \n wear  your  chest  strap.\n{ts:3543} \n >> Can  you? \n\n{ts:3544} >> Yeah. \n >> Oh  yeah.  Yeah.\n{ts:3544} \n >> And  then  it'll  it'll  store  the  info \n\n{ts:3547} >> and  communicate  to  your  watch  when \n you're  done.\n{ts:3549} \n >> Okay. \n\n{ts:3549} >> I  need  we  need  to  fact  check  all  this \n stuff.\n{ts:3551} \n >> Are  you  still  wearing  Apple  Watch,  Ben? \n\n{ts:3552} >> No,  I  sold  it  and  got  this  Garmin. \n >> You  like  it  better?\n{ts:3554} \n >> Way  better. \n\n{ts:3555} >> Can  you  put  music  on  that? \n >> Mhm.\n{ts:3557} \n >> Yes. \n\n{ts:3558} >> Also  check  it  out.  Nice  ones.  You  can \n >> as  a  light.\n{ts:3561} \n >> The  light  or  the  light  is  insane. \n\n{ts:3563} >> Which  one  is  that?  Is  that  the  like \n >> This  is  the  970  4Runner.\n{ts:3567} \n >> Okay. \n\n{ts:3568} >> What  do  you  have? \n >> This  is  the  Phoenix\n{ts:3570} \n 7X.  But  I  like  a  big  ball.  Cheapest  one \n\n{ts:3573} you  could  buy. \n >> Yeah.  But  with  the\n{ts:3575} \n >> Do  you  work  out  with  that  on? \n\n{ts:3576} >> Yeah.  Uh  it  depends  on  what  I'm  doing. \n >> Yeah.\n{ts:3578} \n >> I  I  discovered  because  I  didn't  like  it \n\n{ts:3580} was  getting  in  the  way  of  grips,  but  Dre \n actually  told  me  you  can  take  it  just\n{ts:3584} \n off  the  band  and  slide  it  as  high  as  you \n\n{ts:3587} want.  It's  like  right  here.  And  put  your \n sweatb  band  over  it.\n{ts:3590} \n >> Oh,  I  wish  like  wish  somebody  would  come \n\n{ts:3592} up  with  an  injectable. \n >> Injectable.\n{ts:3596} \n >> Like \n\n{ts:3596} >> just  inject  it  into  my  arm. \n >> Yeah.  And  you  could  just  like  tap  into\n{ts:3600} \n time. \n\n{ts:3600} >> Yeah.  That  or  even  just  a  chip  that  I \n can  like  goes  to  my  phone.\n{ts:3603} \n >> This  is  the  next  step. \n\n{ts:3604} >> Yeah.  That's  it  right  there. \n >> Actually,  it  would  be  cool  like  what's\n{ts:3606} \n that  movie  where  they  have  like  where \n\n{ts:3608} your  time  is  your  is  the  thing  you  can \n gamble  with  or  whatever  whatever  that\n{ts:3611} \n is,  but  like  the  numbers  show  up  in  your \n\n{ts:3612} arm  that  you  just  tap  it.  you  know \n exactly  what's  going  on  in  your  heart.\n{ts:3615} \n Like,  you  know, \n\n{ts:3617} >> like  puts  it  like  somehow  around  your \n veins  and  it  actually  reads  the  flow.\n{ts:3624} \n >> I'm  trying  to  remember  what  it  called. \n\n{ts:3625} Uh  I  got  the  I've  always  wanted  one  of \n them,  but  it's  the  alarm  that  like\n{ts:3629} \n basically  brings  light. \n\n{ts:3631} >> Yeah, \n >> it's  awesome.\n{ts:3632} \n >> You  like  it? \n\n{ts:3632} >> Love  it.  Absolutely  love  it. \n >> Yeah.  Um  yeah,  I  guess  I  was  looking  at\n{ts:3637} \n the  tactical  style  one  of  the  Garmin.  It \n\n{ts:3640} was  all  right.  I  just  don't  like  But  if \n I'm  not  going  to  wear  it  in  metcons\n{ts:3645} \n anyway  anymore  because  it  doesn't  really \n\n{ts:3647} matter  for  me. \n >> Yeah,  you  have  you  have  to  get  one  of\n{ts:3649} \n these  for  Iron  Man  training.  Yeah, \n\n{ts:3651} >> for  sure.  Yeah,  I  I  don't \n >> It  doesn't  get  in  the  way  for  that\n{ts:3653} \n either. \n\n{ts:3654} >> No,  I  want  for  that.  I  just  don't  like  I \n feel  like  that's  kind  of  heavy  where  it\n{ts:3657} \n might  get \n\n{ts:3658} >> Yeah,  that's  why  I  didn't  like  the \n Phoenix  cuz  they  were  they  were  a  lot\n{ts:3661} \n bigger. \n\n{ts:3662} >> How  much  was  that? \n >> I  don't  know.\n{ts:3664} \n >> Four  or  500 \n\n{ts:3665} >> Christmas  present.  Yeah. \n >> Need  to  go  I  need  to  go  somewhere  and\n{ts:3667} \n try  some  on  and  see  which  one  I  like. \n\n{ts:3669} you  know,  cuz  I  always  order  stuff  and \n I'm  like,  I  don't  like  that\n{ts:3671} \n >> and  I  don't  want  to  send  it  back.  I'm \n\n{ts:3673} too  lazy. \n >> Yeah.\n{ts:3674} \n >> Yep.  Um \n\n{ts:3676} >> I  don't  know. \n >> I  took  over.\n{ts:3678} \n >> I  I  did  like  Sorry,  I  don't  want  to \n\n{ts:3680} steal.  Are  you  going  somewhere  else?  I \n was  going  to\n{ts:3682} \n >> bring  it  back  for  one  second  and  then \n\n{ts:3683} you  can  go.  I  do  like  the  Garmin  bike. \n >> Uh  I  like  computer.  I  use  that.  So,\n{ts:3689} \n >> it's  the  same  thing.  I  think \n\n{ts:3691} >> um  Madison  accidentally  didn't  like  she \n was  going  to  cancel  her  Whoop\n{ts:3695} \n subscription  but  didn't.  So,  she  has  it \n\n{ts:3697} for  a  whole  another  year.  So,  I  took  it \n over.  Has  all  her  data  on  there.\n{ts:3700} \n >> Oh,  nice. \n\n{ts:3701} >> So, \n >> so  it  thinks\n{ts:3703} \n >> it  thinks  I'm  a  superhuman.  Yeah.  Yeah. \n\n{ts:3704} Because  like  I  because  I  uh  Well,  also \n my  strain  Well,  like  it'll  it'll  take  I\n{ts:3709} \n mean  it'll  take  a  couple  months.  Yeah. \n\n{ts:3710} The  algorithms  all \n >> Well,  new  I'm  hitting  new  maxes  for\n{ts:3714} \n resting  heart  rate.  Nice. \n\n{ts:3716} >> I'm  uh  Except  her  heart  rate  is  really \n high.  So,  when  she  works  out\n{ts:3720} \n >> Yeah.  Hillary's  just  too \n\n{ts:3721} >> her  when  she  works  out,  she's  in  the \n 180s,  190s  every  the  whole  time.  So  it\n{ts:3725} \n thinks  I'm  barely  working  out  when  I'm \n\n{ts:3727} like  dying. \n >> So  it's  like  you  get  a  six  strain,\n{ts:3729} \n >> a  nine  strain.  Yesterday  I  did  like  30 \n\n{ts:3732} minutes  of  intervals  in  the  morning  and \n I  did  like  a  40m  minute  workout  in  the\n{ts:3736} \n afternoon.  I  had  a  nine  strain. \n\n{ts:3738} >> So  So  my  strain's  really  low,  but  my \n recovery  is  97%  every  day.\n{ts:3743} \n >> Really? \n\n{ts:3744} >> Because  my  resting  heart  rate  is  a  new \n max  every  night.\n{ts:3746} \n >> Hers  her  lowest  ever  was  55  and  I  put  it \n\n{ts:3749} on  immediately  like  and  I  was  going  to \n bed  it  was  43.  So  I  was  like,  \"Oh  yeah,\n{ts:3752} \n it's  going to  be  a  good  recovery. \n\n{ts:3754} Uh,  so  yeah,  it'll  and  I  did  I  actually \n did  order  the  five  because  it  came  free\n{ts:3758} \n when  you  reup  for  another  year.  So, \n\n{ts:3760} >> yeah,  I  didn't  get  I  never  had  the  five, \n so  I  don't  even  know  what  new  metrics  it\n{ts:3763} \n gives  you  for  that. \n\n{ts:3764} >> Yeah,  we'll  see  see  if  I  the  the  newest \n the  nicer  version  of  the  five  can  like\n{ts:3769} \n do  blood  pressure  and  stuff  which  is \n\n{ts:3770} kind  of  cool.  Um,  so  yeah,  I'll  try  it \n out.\n{ts:3775} \n >> Anything  else?  Got  a  code  code  Angelo  or \n\n{ts:3777} anything? \n >> No.  Damn.\n{ts:3779} \n >> No,  just  using  it  because  we  paid  for \n\n{ts:3781} it.  Yeah.  So,  it's  almost  can't  get \n refunds,  so  might  as  well  just  keep\n{ts:3784} \n using  it. \n\n{ts:3786} >> Got  anything,  Scott? \n >> Nothing.\n{ts:3787} \n >> Anything  to  talk  about?

Excellent\n\n### Good content. A few tips though.\n\n03/23/2024\n\nL3X\n\nGreat content and discussion overall. I don\u2019t mind the ranting but people talking over each other is annoying. Audio quality is great. Maybe have a more specific agenda. Show takes twists and turns. lol\n\n### Too politically correct\n\n02/03/2025\n\nStash&Guns\n\nWhen did Rich become so afraid to talk about what he believes to be true? Catering to liberals. At least the mustache guy tries to keep it real.\n\n### Favorite podcast\n\n12/27/2023\n\nEkatlong\n\nLove all of it! So glad they are back, keep the episodes coming. Really enjoy behind the scenes stuff about competitions and what is going on at Mayhem.\n\n## About\n\n## Information\n\n- CreatorRich Froning Jr.\n\n- Years Active2017 - 2025\n\n- Episodes100\n\n- RatingExplicit\n\n- Show Website\n\n",

This is euphoric.\n{ts:6} His upper body strength is insane. [\u00a0__\u00a0] I'm learning so much. I'm so glad that's over.\n{ts:15} [Music] I don't want to [\u00a0__\u00a0] hug you or don't touch it.\n{ts:28} You guys know Hunter, [Music] multiple High Rocks world champion, avid\n{ts:34} athlete, all round badass, and one of my good mates. We're about to put through a pretty\n{ts:44} sweet simulation on a Monday. Guy's flown fresh off his efforts at Western States. Look at his beautiful face.\n{ts:51} Look at that sheen. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to make him go even more red\n{ts:54} when he takes me through an e-om workout. So, typically the way I like to land in New York City is I always call\n{ts:58} Dan. Dan and I will link up. We'll nail a hard workout. Last time I saw him, we were doing repeats around the track.\n{ts:64} Now, we're going to work out at Solace. Like, you know, this whole hybrid scene. It's like 50/50. You got to be good at\n{ts:69} endurance. You got to be good at strength. So, I'm going to put Dan through one of my strength endurance\n{ts:73} workouts. I'll kind of give you guys the details in a second. We'll get changed. We'll go to war. We'll eat some food.\n{ts:78} And then hopefully you guys can repeat the same thing. [Music]\n{ts:88} So, we'll warm up. We'll probably do sled push and TRX rows to start. And we'll go a mom style, 18 minutes. If\n{ts:99} you want, we can either go harder for 2 minutes and get a minute's rest or do you just want to keep on flowing all the\n{ts:106} way through? All the way through. 18 minutes.\n{ts:108} Let's do 18 minutes. Okay. And this is kind of a lactate workout, but since most people don't\n{ts:113} have the time, the money, the resources to do it, the reality is is like when you get to the point where you feel that\n{ts:121} that lactate is starting to form and your muscles are starting to overload a little bit, it takes a while to kind of\n{ts:126} learn this, as soon as it gets up there, push a little bit further and stay there. And don't push so far that\n{ts:134} performance starts to drop. It needs to stay. So, it's sustained burning. That's the nerdy term. If you practice this\n{ts:141} skill, you'll get better at this skill. You don't need a doctor there to prove it.\n{ts:146} Bro science. Bro science. [Music]\n{ts:162} Heat [Music] [Applause]\n{ts:167} [Music] up here.\n{ts:182} [Applause] [Music] [Music]\n{ts:203} [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]\n{ts:220} [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]\n{ts:228} [Applause] [Music] Done.\n{ts:241} [Music] That's good workout. That's a great workout. Come on.\n{ts:248} It's called It's called an espresso. 88 minutes of EON between two exercises. One of which includes a sled push. [\u00a0__\u00a0]\n{ts:260} I love that. I think what I'm learning, oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] [\u00a0__\u00a0] I'm learning so much. I think one of the biggest things you take\n{ts:268} away from these sessions is you don't want to be going over the top of that heavy feeling in your legs. And by by\n{ts:275} doing it over a minute, you're not competing with anyone but yourself. So, you're not thinking about I have to push\n{ts:280} it further than somebody. You're almost pushing it to the intensity of that feeling and flirting with it. It's\n{ts:286} really cool. Also notice that like he just reps out. I think it's more about his mental state. He's talking to\n{ts:291} himself, you know, he's pushing his ability to get an extra rep each time. You can hear it in his voice. So, he's\n{ts:298} he's got that mindset of just wanting to be better each rep. Coach Hunter has got us Coach McIntyre I should say. He's got\n{ts:304} us doing another concept again. This time it's 14 EOM. So, shorter efforts, higher intensity. I'm going to make\n{ts:311} shorter efforts. Instead of doing 18 minutes, we're doing 14. So, less reps, which means we increase the intensity.\n{ts:316} This right here, I'm just going to try to pump it out. And as soon as I get that burn, hold on for a couple more,\n{ts:321} then drop it, shake it out, and just keep on going. It's interesting like in our sport, uh, you can take micro\n{ts:328} breaks, collect yourself, and then tack again and be a lot faster than somebody who kind of just is slogging through\n{ts:334} with those slow repetitions. So, [Music] Back\n{ts:345} [Music] up on the back back.\n{ts:363} [Music] immediately things to think about. Looked over, he's\n{ts:384} pulling like 52 reps per minute. I'm low 40s and he's also pulling more power. So,\n{ts:395} what's my takeaway? I'd get faster, stronger, and a better engine better. [Music]\n{ts:407} Okay, so pretty simple. 10 minutes, five rounds. Technically, you're going to do 20 calorie on the row. You got to get to\n{ts:414} it. And then you got to do 20 burpee. That's one round. Repeat that five times. You're in the one minute time\n{ts:419} dimension of every single round. So, if you get it done in 40 seconds, you got 20 seconds rest. It's obviously like one\n{ts:425} of those kind of things. The first two rounds you're like, I'm a hot shot. Last three rounds you're suffering.\n{ts:430} 2 [Music] [Music]\n{ts:460} [Music] Holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] Oh, my heart's beating out my chest.\n{ts:470} This is euphoric. Great job, bro. Many takeaways in particular. We talk\n{ts:478} about training your lactate threshold in a high rock or hybrid environment. We really work on and understanding our rep\n{ts:484} count and rep range along with our technique on the ski because this guy is just built for it. And then truly\n{ts:489} understanding where to push it in using an e-om style simulation. So we go from a higher minute count down to a lower\n{ts:499} minute count and changing a percentage of intensity along the way. We're finished up now. We're just doing some\n{ts:506} chilled out flushing legs out effort. I'm going to go get a bite to eat and talk actually on this bloke's nutrition\n{ts:511} cuz he says he needs a bit of help. What's that? You need to work on your nutrition.\n{ts:516} I mean, I just want to have like Listen, I could eat candy all day long and still look about the same, but I think there's\n{ts:521} more to it. I mean, I believe in it. I I would rather just like get to know some things\n{ts:526} that I might be able to optimize, go into my next chapter. Being that you specialize in it, I feel good about it.\n{ts:532} But there's a difference between someone who feels good about it and an expert. Man, I'm so glad that's over.\n{ts:537} Yeah. I was like, I'm going to do this cuz I'm not going to be a pansy.\n{ts:544} [Music] [Music] Mine looks the best, dude. Check this\n{ts:562} out. Flavor, flavor, and more flavor. This is just a podge podge of [\u00a0__\u00a0] We finished the workout about 22 minutes\n{ts:571} ago. Got ourselves a smoothie. Getting that one really quickly. We're here at Sweet Green and we've got ourselves some\n{ts:577} bowls. Now, the idea is to get the smoothie in quickly. Quick acting, fast digesting option. Then more substantial\n{ts:583} whole foods, higher fiber intake on the next one. Sweet greens, all these kind of like options, fast casual environment\n{ts:590} are really good options to supply everything you need. And the whole idea was to get this first because no matter\n{ts:597} what, you're still waiting around another 30 minutes for that food. Like we'll get to I only just ordered this.\n{ts:602} So we'll get about 5 minutes, but within 30 minutes I've had smoothie and also a bowl.\n{ts:609} [Music] So Hunter eats north of 4,500 calories when he's on a regular maintenance or\n{ts:617} even loading phase for world championships when he's getting down to a little bit lighter. But lighter for\n{ts:623} him, he's still a big boy. He's doing what, 4,200 USA. I have only really two substantially solid meals a day. And you\n{ts:632} know, those two solid meals can be like, you know, a 10 oz steak and two to three cups of rice. And it could be, you know,\n{ts:640} same exact kind of thing with chicken. And it's a lot like, you know, you're just sitting there and chewing and\n{ts:646} chewing and chewing. The rate at which you're performing requires so much refueling that the rate\n{ts:652} at which you need to absorb then utilize is so quick that it has to be the simple enough\n{ts:658} [Music] Time to hit it. Now, this track session is really\n{ts:684} building into our tempo efforts. I'll explain at the end of this track session what I've learned from the London block\n{ts:691} to the Berlin block. But as we're about to experience, we're doing longer tempo efforts earlier in our block, which is\n{ts:698} really exciting. We're going to start with a 3k warmup into a 3k threshold run. It's a 358 km for myself. Then I'm\n{ts:707} going to have a 2minut jog into 41 km intervals at a 337. So that's a 550 minute mile each with a 2-minute active\n{ts:718} recovery in between. [Music] All\n{ts:729} right, coming up on our start here again. 6 and 12 laps. Holding a 358 is like 6 20 odd miles. Here we go. Let's\n{ts:739} go. [Music] Heat. Heat.\n{ts:769} Heat. Heat. [Music] I think\n{ts:815} we're getting faster. I'll keep bringing it back to like my first ever 1k intervals and it was like 415 pace\n{ts:825} and I was blowing. We just did a 326 and we did four at around 337 plus the 3k threshold. [\u00a0__\u00a0] just put\n{ts:836} the work in. Like bit by bit. And let me just like really just set the tone for the reason why I tell you my times.\n{ts:846} The the reason for me to tell you my times is not to tell you how good or how poor Dan is moving. It's to show a\n{ts:856} quantifiable example of what progress consistency is. So if I tell you I started at 415 for this 1k efforts\n{ts:864} without anything else I tell you now doing 326 it is the product of doing the same thing over and over again writing a\n{ts:873} plan adhering to that plan learning from the plan and then growing same [\u00a0__\u00a0] So my hope is whatever time you're at, you\n{ts:883} are writing a plan, you're adhering to the plan, and then you are growing and reflecting on your growth of that plan.\n{ts:892} It's come to my realization that a lot of you legends see me as like training twice a day, sometimes, most days to be\n{ts:900} honest, but you're still trying to figure out what I do for a living as a chef. But I do a lot of things, but most\n{ts:906} importantly, I help build and sometimes I build things for myself. So over the subsequent weeks during this marathon\n{ts:913} prep, I'm going to be highlighting those just kind of like how I live my life, how I still train multiple times a day,\n{ts:919} recover, but build business and what I do effectively. So really exciting to reveal in a couple weeks. We are\n{ts:927} building a product that is helping support nutrition in a personalized experience way. We also have a brick and\n{ts:934} mortar concept um that is revolutionizing longevity. But more of this to come. But\n{ts:940} ultimately, yeah, I I may try and try I may train twice a day, but we also help build and that's really exciting.\n{ts:951} [Music] Leftover meatballs would happen to be one of the best gifts on this planet.\n{ts:960} It's a hidden secret, a gem. Also share a very special relationship with them because I need more of them. They're a\n{ts:966} ground beef source and they're high in zinc and boron. And I found out that I need more of those. And the reason for\n{ts:971} that is I get my blood tested every quarter. And I do so because I want to know what's truthfully going on inside\n{ts:978} me. There's no way of hiding it, you know, just getting my blood work done. And it found out that despite having\n{ts:983} high amounts of total testosterone, my free testosterone, which is the one we actually, you know, use and not often\n{ts:990} what is tested is actually quite low. And that is because I had something binding to the total testosterone to not\n{ts:995} release it. And you need zinc and boron and other factors to help do that. So by getting my blood work done, by finding\n{ts:1002} that out and testing things that actually required cuz most places only test total testosterone, not free, I\n{ts:1008} have peace of mind. And it also allows me to understand what's going on with my micronutrients, what I'm absorbing, what\n{ts:1013} I need more of. So ultimately, I love getting it tested every quarter. And the great way to do that with Hone, company\n{ts:1019} I advise, is they come straight to your house. The phabotamist come to your house, they take your blood, they assess\n{ts:1024} it, you jump on a call with a consultant, and a doctor, and they put a plan in place for you to let you know\n{ts:1029} what you need to be working on. And it's fantastic. You know, peace of mind, action, and the numbers don't lie. So,\n{ts:1035} if you want to get your blood tested or thinking about doing it but don't know where and don't really want to go out\n{ts:1039} somewhere to do it, click the link in the description, sign up to home. Trust me, I do every call.\n{ts:1053} How about that for a way to finish a video? Hope you enjoyed today's episode and learnings from Hunter, guys. I know\n{ts:1059} I did. You know, there's so much to take away from the way he periodizes to way he programs and also just his philosophy\n{ts:1066} and he's a really smart guy. So hopefully you took a lot away from that. I know I did on my road to sub 60 and\n{ts:1072} the track work. Like I am continuing to learn every single time I step onto the road, the pavement, the track, whatever\n{ts:1078} it is more about running and my body and what I'm able to do where my weaknesses are. So hopefully you guys take that\n{ts:1085} away as well. So whether on your journeys to half marathon, 5K 10, you know, a sub3 yourself or, you know, some\n{ts:1092} sort of road to high rocks journey, there's the whole point of this. I hope you guys are learning each week from the\n{ts:1098} episodes and have some major takeaways cuz next week we are building to Berlin. We are diving deeper into the marathon\n{ts:1105} and the prep to go sub 3. My name's DC. See you in the next episode. Heat.\n{ts:1116} [Music] Heat.",

Today is all about getting the minimal\n{ts:10} effective dose. That means that we're doing the minimum possible to create the stimulus that we need for the session.\n{ts:21} This Monday morning, we're at Undefeated Gym and we're 4 days out from the solo event for Friday night. Today we've got\n{ts:28} a bit of a technique session and a little bit of an easier day. We're feeling good and it's just about\n{ts:33} brushing up on technique today. That's the main focus. So, we're still quite early in the\n{ts:43} season. There's only been one Harox Major. I obviously didn't do as well as I wanted within the singles, but the\n{ts:51} doubles we secured our spot. So, we've basically ticked one out of two boxes that we need to [music] tick for this\n{ts:58} season. It's going off to a good start. Melbourne is where I want to tick that second box and qualify for world champs\n{ts:64} in the singles. Setbacks that have shaped me was not finishing in Chicago the end of last\n{ts:74} season. And that just opened my eyes up to getting more serious about training,\n{ts:86} going more allin and being pulled of recovery. During race week, it's really important\n{ts:94} I think that athletes get that balance between the frequency, the volume, and the load. Physically and mentally, the\n{ts:100} buildup to race is stressful. It build it breaks you down a little bit. So, it's all about getting over that\n{ts:105} physical and mental fatigue cuz it is a grind when you're training 25 hours a week. No one I don't care what\n{ts:112} anyone says. No one's waking up every day thinking I can't wait to do this again.\n{ts:115} And my mindset I feel like has always been there. But for race day, we need to be rested both physically and mentally,\n{ts:125} which I've probably not done as well of a job in the past of resting mentally. So I've specifically been working on my\n{ts:136} wall balls. There has been some fast courses and some fast times. Right now, I do need a faster time to keep me\n{ts:145} secured in the Harx majors for this season. So, I'm aiming for a low 55 or a 54. I really really I want my first 54\n{ts:154} of the season. Feeling good. Feeling strong at the stations. Feeling strong with the\n{ts:162} running. Now on Friday, we just see if I'm strong with them both together. [music]\n{ts:185} [music] So obviously I placed 11th. Not super happy with that, but I was happy with my\n{ts:191} performance. [music] felt like I was fit, felt like I ran\n{ts:193} well. Um, it was a stacked heat out there. Congrats to all my competitors because they were they all performed\n{ts:200} well and it was cool to be out there. Yeah, I think we settled in to the race and I think when James set off like I\n{ts:213} realized we're we're in for it. He wants it here. I felt good yesterday. He didn't feel\n{ts:222} too good yesterday. So, coming into this race, it was like all on him whether we perform or we don't. And he had the fire\n{ts:230} in his belly today. He really did push from the start. And I just managed to keep up with him. Like, we have worked\n{ts:237} so hard for this and it's actually finally like come true. I never knew it would happen.\n{ts:247} So, for me, uh, I've got a marathon in just over a month's time, but then it's straight back to Arizona for the next\n{ts:255} major. So, we just, uh, we're qualified for the next major. So, see you in Arizona.\n",

A CrossFit Games champion comes on the show with his business (and HYROX Doubles) partner, Gabe Yanez. Together, they talk about where the explosion of HYROX crosses the current state of the CrossFit community. We dive into what CrossFit did right in the early days, some mistakes they've made, and how they might get back on track. We also dig into Jason and Gabe's doubles effort in Texas and when we might see them back on the HYROX floor.\n\n\u2026\n\n{ts:1051} what if we took away a couple of these things that are a little scary for the new person well and it added extensive amounts added the run right I think that's a that's a major factor there is that the run is long the the run is long and is hard and you know people have been trying to evolve CrossFit for a while there's been a bunch of different\n\n\u2026\n\n{ts:1088} you could you could do it easily you could train anywhere and I think hro has hit kind of like this nerve where it's a bridge of people that are coming from Crossfit and also Runners and they're kind of like this this hybrid again you have some people coming from running backround some people coming from Crossfit it's just kind of like a good blend between the two I I think what",

On race day, you realize running \u2192 immediate station work is brutal.\n\n**Why It's Bad:**\n\n**Transitions are where races are won or lost.** Going from high heart rate running to technical station work while gasping for air is a skill. If you haven't practiced it, you'll waste 10-20 seconds per transition standing around catching your breath.\n**The Fix:**\n\n**Practice \"run + station\" combos in training:**\n\n- Run 800m at race pace \u2192 SkiErg 500m \u2192 Run 400m\n\n- Run 1km \u2192 Sled Push 50m \u2192 Run 800m\n\n- Run 1km \u2192 Row 500m \u2192 Run 1km\n\nGet comfortable with the heart rate spike and the mental adjustment. Your body adapts.\n\n## 7. Skipping SkiErg and Row Practice\n\n**The Mistake:**\n\n\"I'm a good runner, I'll just push through the cardio machines.\"\n\n**Why It's Bad:**\n\n**Technique matters.** A skilled rower can finish 1000m in 4:00. A beginner with bad form? 5:30.

intrigued on uh you definitely got me intrigued on how the bill doubled um and I could see how\n{ts:13} things like that could happen anyways yeah man pay attention I'm uh I'm I'm a little bit smaller shop over here so listen we're obviously going to talk a lot about high rocks about the hybrid space we gotta talk some CrossFit first and my question for you Jason is a guy who's been around since the beginning and Gabe\n{ts:34} how long have you been around almost the beginning um 2013 so not the beginning beginning but long time long time close enough close enough the general idea of it's not as good as it was everything sucks why are they changing it where would you put that like on a level that it\n{ts:56} it's different than any other year for the last seven that I know of it's not as good as it was so you're talking your question is over the last seven years is CrossFit not as good as it was is that is that the question no M sorry let me let me rephrase the\n{ts:78} community bitching yes the general idea of it was better before they're doing it wrong why did they change the open why did they change the qualifying crossfit's dying like it it's the same argument that to me to me I'll just say for me from the somewhat outside looking in other than the Lazar piece which\n{ts:100} obviously is pretty horrible that's like an added like oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] these guys but other than that where do you see it in terms of the community and your thoughts on how they're doing oh man um I mean here's what I'd say about CrossFit CrossFit started off as the\n{ts:120} gy the culture that was set from the top down was the antithesis of what everybody else was doing we're going to go high intensity our warmup is your workout like we are we are the small guy that's fighting this battle to bring functional training to the world right that was always like the the the model\n{ts:136} right and you know I I worked for CrossFit for a while I've taught tons of seminars I mean I'm as deep in as you can get and I would say that over the years this thing that started off as small grew and grew and grew and eventually what happens is you get so big that you're no longer like this small you know outfit of people trying\n{ts:156} to do something that's against the norm you're now becoming more and more normal right like it's it's more common place to see functional training I think because of CrossFit you're seeing kettle bells in a in a hotel gym and the culture though didn't seem to um evolve with it like as CrossFit grew the\n{ts:174} culture still stayed kind of like this combative like us against you us against the world and I think that in the last couple years you've seen that kind of escalate I do think though that for most people I I think it's a handful or a small uh select group of people online that make it that become very loud I\n{ts:194} think if you go into CrossFit Gyms I think if you visit CrossFit Seminars the overall energy is very positive but it's this group of people that are online that become very loud and overwhelming which allows you to feel like over the last x amount of years the culture just gotten worse and worse and worse and I\n{ts:212} think the leadership at CrossFit needs to come in and and nip all that like just stop it all because online it's it perception becomes reality and that becomes very difficult so I would say if you ask me I think CrossFit hit a a really beautiful peak in like 13 14 15 16 it's now kind of you know kind of had\n{ts:232} a couple of rough patches along the journey just like anything and I think for them to take it to the next level they're going to need to um just they're going to need to to kind of focus on the future and not allow the people of the past to take such a microphone because the outsiders don't\n{ts:250} recognize of all this beauty that's going on in CrossFit all they hear is what you're talking about right now do you have to add gab I mean I agree with with most of that what I would add to that is that like I I also think that like CrossFit hasn't done itself any favors in many\n{ts:268} ways um and that that goes without saying but even not like the big big things even if you just talk about like when have we had two consecutive years with the same format like just a little bit of consistency a little bit of better communication even if you change all the things that you've changed as\n{ts:286} much as you've changed it but you're communicating stuff out a little bit earlier you're giving people you know a better platform to contribute to those decisions I just think that everything could have been done a little bit better and obviously that's easy to say when you're not involved but I do think that it's a vocal minority I do think that\n{ts:303} it's just people being hesitant to change and we are in a much different landscape Fitness landscape now both competitive and methodology than we were in in you know the early 2010s and people kind of stay in their ways and I I in many ways I get that I'm\n{ts:322} like one of the most like resistant people to change your meat but I think that that's kind of what fuels a lot of this is people just like just get so stuck in the good old days and it's like hey we're just it's a different time that's it it's just we we're in a different time yeah Matt like just to kind of give some more context the\n{ts:339} current CEO of CrossFit was a member of our gym for eight years and I know him really I know him well right and before he took the job at CrossFit I told him I was like hey man I'm just letting you know it's like taking over um I use the analogy and and I'm sure that someone's going to get upset with this but I use the analogy of like a church because\n{ts:357} it's like a new pastor coming into a church and the reason why it's so powerful is because people have had their lives changed through CrossFit myself included like they they became different humans they connected they they CrossFit has done so much for the fitness space it's unbelievable and\n{ts:376} within that for millions of people however I think the hard part for CrossFit and i' I've suffered for this is that your identity starts to become a part of it so for example if CrossFit changed your life and you really believe that then all of a sudden when new ownership comes or when something happens it becomes very personal for you\n{ts:394} like like it would in your faith right like if a new person comes in this is a part of your identity your culture and so any change is taken with a lot of difficulty verse like Gabe was saying like if it was just purely like this business transaction I was like Hey I just show up at this gym it would be different but a lot of people identify\n{ts:413} as this and that's what made it so difficult you at some point unaffiliated though correct yeah so I mean that's that's a complicated situation but to non short just sort of the short version and so like I mean I think\n{ts:432} my a lot of my audience is is is CrossFit or knows about CrossFit but for those that that don't know and uh uh you can correct me if I'm wrong you were one of the well first of all you're the first Champion correct or the second Champion yeah second okay uh and then you were one of the\n{ts:452} first folks to have your own not just programming but people could be affiliated with you right as your your uh your brand you were one of the early ones to to step in and go okay I can be more than just one location or or a franchise this is this\n{ts:473} is my training this is my coaching and this is my community for lack of a better word kind of kind of not not not not necessarily like our background is I started off I won the CrossFit Games opened a gym open multiple gyms got into corporate Wellness opened a bunch of those worked for CrossFit HQ um like I\n{ts:491} said I was as deep in the mix as you could possibly get competed professionally for a decade and then um as things evolved I we rebranded from NorCal cross fany fit to be more indicative of what we were offering within the gym and part of that was me being really close to HQ and just recognizing that I wanted to be control\n{ts:509} of our own destiny which was why we wanted to Rebrand it it just it allowed any like any gym owner out there any business owner out there they want to be in control of as many things as you can like you don't want your your livelihood and the livelihoods of your entire team um at Jeopardy from something else and so we want to be more in control and we\n{ts:529} wanted our programming to be indicative of what we were offering so we rebranded NC fit that ruffled a few feathers but we still stayed affiliate and then fast forward there was just some stuff that we didn't align with with with Crossfit and we decided to unaffiliated because we didn't align with them on certain things well fast forward some things changed we're now in alignment again in\n{ts:549} in many ways um and so we reaffiliation the gyms but your brand name doesn't change now still sustained NC fit and then as far as the license you referring to that was that all kind of happened around the same time we had at one point you know 30 of our own own and operated locations but a lot of those were corporate\n{ts:566} Wellness so that was a little bit different at the time right so the idea of people affiliating my understanding again correct me was that at the peak it was really important to be like type in my town on the word CrossFit right and get found right so if\n{ts:588} I live in southwest Atlanta call it Southwest Atlanta CrossFit and that was kind of the most one of the most important reasons now folks are deail they changed their name to whatever this gym was Fitness strength and conditioning whatever it is uh\n{ts:608} whether they deail because they didn't want to pay anymore because everything they went down with Greg whatever those reasons are do you think that that is going to make a difference uh in terms of how people find\n{ts:625} gyms in terms of how they find it like how like it used to be super valuable to just have the word CrossFit in your name and now I don't think it is doesn't mean crossfits not as popular but that's what I'm kind of getting your you guys take on it I think a lot of it is very and these are always unsatisfying answers but a\n{ts:643} lot of it depends on your location and where you are and I think that yeah it used to be that if you especially had the name of like CrossFit Texas or CrossFit whatever like whatever the biggest thing is it was a big big deal if you got that affiliate name first and now I think because it's so saturated you also just have to weigh\n{ts:663} the pros and cons of like in your community specifically because it's been really interesting for me moving from California to Texas where there are more people here it's almost like three or or four years behind where there's like more people here still like actively looking for CrossFit CrossFit versus all\n{ts:682} these other things and so that's where I think it varies greatly geographically to decide like hey is the fact that we say hey we offer CrossFit classes going to bring more people in the door or not and that's just an impossible thing now to say that's yes for everyone or no for\n{ts:702} everyone it's going to depend on so so so many factors um which makes it you know a not a no-brainer decision anymore but I don't think it's it's a negative for everyone either I think that there in some cases it makes a lot of sense to be the one gym that still has CrossFit on the building in your area like it absolutely makes sense does it make sense to be the one of\n{ts:725} 10 probably not you have to find a way to differentiate yourself whatever that looks like well I think this is this kind of brings us to where we are now because folks are learning about high rocks and so they're definitely going to search H Rox gym near me or where can I train for\n{ts:745} a hiero and there is uh a billion content creators online and everything in my feed is is something with the word hro on the thumbnail and it was so refreshing so many smiles to my face as I heard you appreciate all the things\n{ts:765} they do right because I've been watching it up close and I hadn't heard anybody break it down as well as you guys did you just basically talked about your whole experience and the things that for the people that want to kind of poo poo it or say like well whatever it's\n{ts:784} the latest thing just like OCR was I'm telling you so before this like I obstacle racing media that's my background I'm telling you there are so many leaps and bounds ahead of the obstacle racing industry Tia clar Tumi was not running a Spartan Race a lot of obstacle race a\n{ts:802} lot of people did a lot of people were like did try one but it was like a fun or a goof or with their friends it wasn't let me train for this let me now sell nobody like Tia was then not going to sell programming on how to train for sparter you see what I'm saying yeah so this has the ceiling is so much higher\n{ts:821} and trust me I still have that business and 300,000 people did a Spartan Race last year it's not going away but my point is you pointed out all the things they did right in terms of atmosphere how well it's organized photos like split times all the stuff that again is a no-brainer to do but most people might\n{ts:842} have the idea but miss massively on execution yeah I mean I'll just kick go ahead gab well I was just gonna say man like people just want to like people want to like look cool and feel cool and Hier roox just does that and it does it really well man like from being in that\n{ts:861} tunnel before you start to like the stage that you run on when you're done to everything in between they figured it out man and it was super interesting Jason and I um were lucky enough to have like a little walk through the day before because we bumped into the uh the COO of H rocks um\n{ts:882} yuh Jacob and just all the little details like everything that they've thought of honestly from like a business perspective like I was there was a lot to learn from just all the details matter and they've been so intentional with all the details that it makes sense\n{ts:900} that it's growing how it's growing and I have no experience with um like the obstacle racing Community aside from the fact that I never felt like I needed to try a Spartan Race but when all my friends because I'm originally from New York posted their pictures of doing last year's New York City race I felt like I\n{ts:920} had to go and try this I was like there's too many of my friends that are doing it and posting these pictures and saying that they had a great time like I just have to like see for myself I have to and that especially especially that especially that venue it was Pier 76 y it was amazing weather and it was like like everything was perfect that was\n{ts:939} like everything they could have wanted to be in more and as you might have seen they're going back instead of one day it's three days already sold out insane insane I was trying to get my my buddy to sign up to do uh Pro doubles with me and um I was like we gotta act now this\n{ts:958} thing's selling out anyway we we ended up not being able to work out but I was impressed at how quick it sold out crazy yeah and I feel like and that maybe that piece changes maybe it doesn't sell out in however many minutes that's what's been happening in England for a year year and a half they can't\n{ts:978} get tickets because they're so uh they're so um they're so hot for it here's my here's my question and again comparing it to this obstacle racing side is many people obviously uh ran to train for obstacle\n{ts:996} racing you know Trail runs outside maybe some cold weather training they certainly did people certainly worked out in the gym but the A to B of hey we just got really strong and fit in the gym now let's go run in the woods for six miles and get muddy right or go to this mountain and what is hiero but the\n{ts:1016} stuff we're doing in the gym every day anyway without the intimidating quote unquote piece of CrossFit right no lifts no Olympic movements it's kind of like what took what took somebody so long to figure this out like I was just in the working out yesterday and I just thought\n{ts:1033} even if none of these people know about Hier rocks right now if they wanted to and I said you know you could do this what you're doing but go compete with your friends and look like a rock star it just seems like what took us so long for someone to figure out if you want to use the term Fitness racing why did nobody go hey people love CrossFit but\n{ts:1051} what if we took away a couple of these things that are a little scary for the new person well and it added extensive amounts added the run right I think that's a that's a major factor there is that the run is long the the run is long and is hard and you know people have been trying to evolve CrossFit for a while there's been a bunch of different\n{ts:1069} things that have came out a lot of it still relied on the complexity I think what higho has done is they've made it almost like dude I mean Marathon running is very popular 10ks are very popular they're very popular because they're inclusive and people can set goal times and then train towards that and running is cheap you could do it outside right\n{ts:1088} you could you could do it easily you could train anywhere and I think hro has hit kind of like this nerve where it's a bridge of people that are coming from Crossfit and also Runners and they're kind of like this this hybrid again you have some people coming from running backround some people coming from Crossfit it's just kind of like a good blend between the two I I think what\n{ts:1104} they did really well though is they just made you kind of feel like you're an All-Star they they did a good job with pictures they did a good job with the environment they did a good job with the vibe I think those things go a long way for people to go home and tell their friends hey I had a good experience here I had fun everything was on time everything felt good like that's really important for the growth and the\n{ts:1122} longevity of the sport in my opinion you you can't just rely on people having like a tremendously hard event it has to also be enjoyable and exciting and fun and they do that with the spectators and the way the event is laid out but and I'm curious your guys's take I think that there was a time where all the things that quote unquote make it\n{ts:1142} intimidating for a beginner were the reason that everyone wanted to sign up for CrossFit competition like true there was a time where like people wanted to rip their hands they wanted to have a picture of them with a barbell overhead like it was the the hard aspect of it that made that incredibly incredibly you\n{ts:1162} know in enticing for people to want to compete and I think that like I think about W palooza doing a pretty good job of doing like the hero aspect of it like at the time those types of competitions did a really good job because you were competing on the same stage as the pros which is what exactly what hiero does\n{ts:1180} right like the fact that you can go to Miami and compete with your buddies in the same exact competition and venue as the CrossFit Games athletes that's why woa was like a crazy crazy successful event I'm trying to think about what changed but something definitely changed right like there isn't that same people wanting to do the CrossFit\n{ts:1199} competition but and maybe that's our perspective too gab that's a good point yeah I mean just full disclosure like yesterday I'm at the gym and um NorCal classic came out and said that the top two people there are going to qualify for the CrossFit Games and you know the comp team at the gym there's like 10 of them they were buzzing they were buzzing\n{ts:1218} about it and for me like it doesn't really it doesn't really inspire me necessarily but for them it was a really big deal so maybe I mean dude W pla had 5,000 people competing on a regular basis I don't know how many they'll have this year but I think what's unique about hrock is dude they're having 6,000 people like basically all the time and\n{ts:1237} they could run a ton of people through each event whereas some of these other CrossFit events they capped out because of the equipment the space the this or that whereas hro is is a little bit easier to do that yeah I just feel like this whole again this whole idea and it still\n{ts:1254} doesn't even quite have a term yet some people call it hybrid Fitness racing some people call it hybrid Fitness right like so if you call it Fitness race which I think kind of where we're headed so Spartan has their version called Deca which is this um I'd say considerably easier version I mean listen anything you Redline at can\n{ts:1273} be hard but it's it's about half the time of Hier roox and it's not got the same traction because they don't have the money they they might have the money but they don't put it behind it but I keep thinking one of these other big companies that does have money right A lot of these uh whether it's a clothing\n{ts:1292} and apparel Weare or people that make the the equipment to go wait a minute there's like look at all that money that's being made by H rocks why can't we go get some of that and we've still been waiting there's this other new event called deadly dozen you'll probably start hearing about that and a couple of other small ones but I keep\n{ts:1309} waiting for somebody big to like kind of like lay their uh lay their cards at the table and go okay well we're we're basically like the Spartan and the tough mutter right now there's kind of just H rocks it's just dominating yeah Nike could come in and create an event put a ton of cash behind it right that would be a big that would be a big threat um\n{ts:1328} do you do you do you see that happening I don't know I mean here's what I do know is that I coming from a background where like I was you know I was a part of CrossFit in 2006 I've seen it from like the inner workings and I watched it evolve I see a lot of similarities in the H Rock space like for example they\n{ts:1346} have a license program that they're doing right very similar to crossi they had a license program they are going to start rolling out higho type gyms similarish uh they're going to have an education series um they have programming there's a lot of similarities between them and I think that they could learn from what CrossFit did really well and they are and they're\n{ts:1365} evolving on that and but dude yeah like you're saying it just takes a competitor to come in with some major amounts of money to cause some some some disruption there so here's the interesting piece so them and both have this thing called Affiliates right but we all think of an affiliate as a like CrossFit right\n{ts:1384} you're paying for the name and then uh you can do these things with it it's almost flipped with hyox and DEA because if I have a Hier roox gym and I if sorry if I own a gym whether it's a box or um n f45 or whatever right just whatever\n{ts:1405} Joe's gym around the corner that everybody loves I probably don't need programming help I'm a coach right I just want people to come so again it's that marketing piece of being on their website so giving them it's really cheap now I think it's like 100 or 120 bucks a month yeah I want to say what was it Gabe like 1,500 a year was it the\n{ts:1425} license I I don't remember but but Jason you don't you don't need you don't need to go to their website and say oh what's what training are they offering me you know what I'm saying well here's where I think this is going to be an interesting debate right so CrossFit start off at $500 for license fee and with that license fee came the use of the mark and\n{ts:1444} that was what it was the only commitment that Greg has ever made to anybody was you get to use the mark of CrossFit and I think that was a really powerful thing at the time because he never committed anything to anybody like bro you get to use the mark and it's my job to drive value with the mark right and then over the years went from 500 to a th000 to\n{ts:1460} 1500 to 2,000 to this that and now if I'm not mistaken I think it's 5,000 and you get a $500 credit towards education so crossfit's responsibility is to drive enough value through the mark through a variety of things that you see enough value as an owner to spend $5,000 Hier Rock's gonna have to do the exact same\n{ts:1479} thing right but where I think it becomes a little bit of a slippery slope and I would recommend Hier rocks to look into this is that if you become a licens of Hier rocks you want to have some level of consistency and I think that that's an area that cross probably could have done a little bit different where it created some level of parameters but that's just my opinion right like\n{ts:1497} anybody could be hrock affiliate now as long as they pay their fee to use the Mark is that a good thing or a bad thing because over time there's G to be different expressions of hrock but H rock is different from Crossfit it's not as varied so maybe it won't be as big of a problem yeah and like there's only so I\n{ts:1515} live in Atlanta and they put on these events called uh pfts which uh I thought they were all free some people charge for them for their gym um and again Deca does this as well these gym events but the way Deca does it smartly is it's basically it's basically a qualifier if\n{ts:1532} you do it at a gym and you get judged your score goes into a thing and at the end of the year Deca which is owned by Spartan puts on this world championship hi rocks it's just hey show up here's your Mark here's your patch I just got my patch but it's just more of a community workout right but you know\n{ts:1549} what I can do since if I live in New York and High Rock only comes around once a year I can create a half rocks right and I can charge for that see what I'm saying so now I can make a few grand and put on some cool events and probably get myself a few members like there's this there's this gym in New York that actually puts on um\n{ts:1572} I forget what they call it uh Stairway To High rocks where there's no space for them to run so they go up and down stairs and you can do that kind of stuff and that's where they might eventually say okay not everybody gets to put on their own version of this but that's what I would do right Atlanta's only going to have one hro one day in April\n{ts:1592} but if I own a gym and I'm like cool let's put on you know you send them out for the run but you don't do a thousand meters right you do 250 or 500 you just go out around the gym I'm sure you guys have done this kind of stuff before right come back in then do your ski then do your sled you see what I'm saying so the value is just them like I know I\n{ts:1612} know that CrossFit was pretty hardcore with we're going to shut shut you down if you use that name I don't know some gyms might be like screw it let's just call it a high Rock event and hope they don't find us yeah I don't know I I haven't seen that stuff but that's that's interesting it's interesting it's all gonna be\n{ts:1628} interesting to see where it goes the um it fits like a little mini comp right so hey instead of you know we've got we're going to put on this one comp in the spring called you know badasses and ladies but then in March we do one called half Rock and it's a high you know see what I'm saying and that's again that's CrossFit that's f45 that's\n{ts:1646} any gym that wants to do that back in the old school days right this is this was a point of contention you couldn't call it a CrossFit competition so if we wanted to host a local Throwdown we would call it whatever right but we could not call we couldn't use the mark CrossFit for those type of events even as a even as a licensed\n{ts:1664} affiliate because and same thing on merchandise right unless it was actually your affiliate name so it couldn't just say CrossFit on the front it had to say CrossFit NorCal CrossFit it had to be attached to your actual license Mark so these are all things that h is going to have to I'm sure I'm sure they're working through all this because they've seen it already go out with Crossfit\n{ts:1682} right but that's the thing they're growing so fast that they kind of are doing it back like the affiliate stuff they're just getting around to and I know they announced 5,000 clubs I don't know if that's a real number or like when they hooked up with bft in Australia and f45 those gyms automatically became it I I have a\n{ts:1701} feeling that's it I got to do the research on their website but because they've been growing so fast in so many countries this gym piece has been almost secondary you see what I'm saying they haven't really done the Grassroots let's get this it's just hey how can we get people to these events and now these events are selling out now they're\n{ts:1719} starting to figure out like okay how can we how can we grow but again like so they launched their own thing they've got all these gym Partnerships okay let me ask you this as a as a business person Jason the the hiero in Atlanta is called The Sweat House Atlanta hiero Sweat House is like a one of those cool sauna rich people gyms right in Canada\n{ts:1741} in Toronto it was called the good life hiero because that was the local sponsor in England in Manchester it was my protein right so it could doesn't have to be a gym it could be anything but they do all these Partnerships and then on top of that they're selling their hro 365 which is oh we're GNA teach we're g\n{ts:1760} to sell you the training and we're GNA train you the methodology and I just feel like they're stepping all over each other there there's no consistency well we had a call with with one of the people on their team about the way that they roll out the programming and I will say the way they roll out the programming is light years ahead of when CrossFit originally rolled out the programming it's light years because oh\n{ts:1779} yeah that so I'm they're already because again they're learning they're seeing I mean the the the you know the top guys were CrossFit affiliate owners they've recognized that and they're probably making decisions based on what their experiences were and I think H rocks D they're just on a rocket ship they're going to figure it out and it's just for\n{ts:1797} me the way I look at H rocks I'm not even necessarily as interested in the business model I think it's interesting I think it's more like hey dude Gabe wanted to do one I went out there I had a great experience I think H Ro is on a rocket ship and I think it's fun will I do on another one sure if Gabe wants to do one I'll do it um but just like anything I think they're gonna have\n{ts:1814} their evolution as a business just like CrossFit has you know and I think that I'm only hopeful that CrossFit and H Rox can both Thrive but I do think that one will that one will grow more than the other I I'm not here to say which one but it's going to be an interesting battle over the next little bit of time\n{ts:1832} because they are very similar but again one's one's a methodology and one's an event company is it I mean yeah it's interesting I mean because they have a lot of the same you're right I think crossfit's a phenomenal methodology right constantly very function movement at high intensity and Hier rock is an events company but\n{ts:1851} then they're also putting out programming and they're opening up gyms and affiliations so how does that work I think but because because I think they think that's what you're supposed to do oh I don't know yeah what do you think G it's so tough because because CrossFit has become so like it's changed Fitness\n{ts:1869} to Jason's point it's kind of like one of those things where it what isn't CrossFit like to me you know to me people that are going out and doing High rocks are people that are training CrossFit in in many ways right like it becomes tough to Define like I'd be curious I I wasn't on the call but I'd be I'd be interested to figure out like\n{ts:1893} what is h Rock's training like what are these gyms how are these gyms training and isn't that how a lot of CrossFit boxes are now putting out programs maybe because a lot of people are moving away from the complexity for a a whole variety of reasons you know people aren't snatching and doing bar muscleups anymore not because they're training for\n{ts:1912} H rocks but because I think you know the the the time for that stuff is kind of like come and gone I think a lot of people realized that like hey you can get pretty fit without having to do the high complexity stuff so I don't know it's tough because how do you how do you distinguish what is CrossFit and what isn't when there's kettle bells and rigs\n{ts:1930} in every gym now and he laid the framework for H rocks for sure no obviously obviously laid the framework however this is where we have a bit of a bone of contention so that's what I was in I was at that fitfest in the UK and that's what Emily Ral said she said well it's all CrossFit anyway and I've heard other people say that as\n{ts:1950} well and you guys I feel like you're a little too myopic uh in that um there is an idea that it's this there you guys seem not like zealots but there are definitely zealots right and zealots and zealots are a big turnoff right obviously they think\n{ts:1972} they're not but they'll they'll they'll drop the the the Greg is of solving the world's biggest problem right and it's like well Spartan Racing is doing that too right and so are so is f45 right like what's your purpose we want to get people fit and lose weight and get out of the couch you know what I'm saying so\n{ts:1993} and then the community piece I just said this on another show but I'm gonna say it again the community piece is awesome however I wanted to do this uh like a mini documentary maybe I will one day maybe I won't but if you if I took 20 people and I said tell me what this community means to you and they said\n{ts:2011} I've never had friends like this uh I felt welcome I felt non- judged I've traveled with these people um they've they've given me a life I never knew was there like and then I would say what are they talking about and you don't know it could be Spartan it could be CrossFit it\n{ts:2031} could be their Church you see what I'm saying and I think a lot of times people in CrossFit think you guys like you're the only place that that comes from that you're solving the world's biggest problem and that there's a somebody that's a lot of places you see what I'm saying just to to pause on that for just a quick second I do think what made CrossFit so unique in its early days was\n{ts:2050} that it was one of the rare circumstances where this was happening within a fitness setting so let me give you an example I grew up in the conventional gym there was no Community Connection at all then when we had a coach it created a foster a sense of community because the coach created a class and the class then started connect with each other whereas in the\n{ts:2069} conventional gym it wasn't like that right you just show up you do your thing so I do think CrossFit for many people at the time it it became that and then then things evolved right like dude you could totally meet people through whatever means like Jiu-Jitsu for example is a phenomenal Community as well no I bet people feel that way about\n{ts:2086} their pickleball community that they've made liong friends out of right but I think CrossFit in the fitness space maybe you could you could make an argument right there was yoga gyms and spinning and pilates and like that but I think CrossFit did it different because it was so difficult it was so hard it was one of the first fitness group\n{ts:2105} settings that I could think of that was so hard that connected people since then many more things have came around right like kyrock and others but I think that hard stuff Doing Hard [\u00a0__\u00a0] together connected people I think that's what made it unique to start yeah goor Ruck thinks they did as well by the way that's another one just comes to mind right because they they suffer together\n{ts:2124} they get these lifelong friends and it does yeah rcking yeah but they think that like you talk if you talk to Jason the owner of like he thinks rucking is the solution to every every problem like I just get out put Ruck wait in your back and go out for a walk and you know what in his mind and like I I I agree with him in that sense\n{ts:2141} like dude if you can get people to Ruck every day do hard [\u00a0__\u00a0] you're probably G to make friends and do something hard and learn more about yourself like let's go I think people just need to figure out what works for them right like is it CrossFit is it High Rock is it Spartan Racing who knows who cares as long as you're doing something you know right and I just want to I that's my personal feeling is that there's more of what you\n{ts:2160} just said that people understand that nobody owns the concept of fitness and Community for sure yeah I mean I think that like what I was answering is more specific to the training methodology I mean I probably disagree with Jason on this I personally think everyone should be doing hybrid training I think\n{ts:2177} everyone would benefit from running and lifting weights that's that that if I were to say like what is the best way that you could achieve most of your goals and feel healthy and all that stuff I Honestly Love hypertrophy and\n{ts:2193} strength training combined with running and that's why like I I I love H rocks too but the tough part is that there's so many people that just as soon as they see guys shirtless pushing a sled combining it with running and doing burpees it just immediately is like oh well that's that's CrossFit whether\n{ts:2214} they're they're CrossFit zealots or not it's just it's been so baked in to the fitness culture that there's just there there's an aesthetic that you'll take 100 people out of the street and show them what are these people doing and I'd venture to say that you're going to get like a 70% oh that's CrossFit now can that change over time like could it be\n{ts:2234} that 10 years from now we run the same experiment and people are like oh they're doing High rocks possibly and I think that things maybe are trending I anybody has said it as well as that Gabe so congratulations let's go Gabe no I'm being well because listen like like people when people I started doing obstacle racing and I started a podcast\n{ts:2252} in 2012 and it's like what do you do and I have to explain what a podcast is and I have to explain what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] Spartan Racing was and then about five years later I could say have you heard of Spartan and they'd go of course and it' usually be either I did one my boss did one my girlfriend's trying to get me to do one and now I never have to explain it right and hiero I definitely still have to explain to my neighbor right\n{ts:2273} yeah hey here so so so I think whereas CrossFit again like actually know what that is so it's it's I think that's the best way to explain it is the association of well uh I don't race with my shirt off but I hear what you're saying now shirt or no shirt Gabe for your for your H rocks I went shirt on the whole time because I dude I sweat if\n{ts:2294} if sweating was a Olympic sport I would gold medal in it and I was um things tend to get slippery and very messy once you come to the wall balls I was trying to keep my shirt on to like try and help with that purely uh uh um strategic reasons my shirt came off because it got so damn sweaty I think in hindsight I don't know well maybe in the next one\n{ts:2314} I'll just start with it off I'm gonna I'm G be super jacked by that one anyway so it'll be feel good do you can can I ask you real quickly Jason how like obviously when when you know some of these games athletes have showed up uh you know they get they get fairly recognized right um and they're pretty excited like you're so old schooled do\n{ts:2332} you still and and I know your show's big but do you still get recognized like like were you able Gabe is J has said like were you able even to walk to go get change or was it constantly taking photos no I mean it's I I'd say at this point like whether I'm at the CrossFit Games crosso game is probably the most but H Rock I'd say second um and then\n{ts:2350} Jiu-Jitsu i' put as third um so like if I'm walking through an airport it'll be one or two people if I'm at a CrossFit Games it'll be ex you know a lot more than that but it's not so much to the point where like back in the day early days it would be like I couldn't walk anywhere without a bunch of people W to take a picture so I would just like have a line take a picture take\n{ts:2368} now it's a lot of like yeah pictures but then more so like stories like dude I listen to a podcast you're on I watch a YouTube video I watched a documentary of you you changed my life stuff like that and I end up having like a more of like a a real human connection with them we have a conversation so it's just changed a little bit over time right but was it\n{ts:2385} was it was it about what you thought at hro was it more was it less in terms of just being recognized in general what do you think Gabe I'd say it's about it was about on on par right than than what we expected I think it was it was a little bit more maybe even than I expected because I I I went into\n{ts:2406} it expecting it to be like all right I know there's going to be a lot of people here that have done CrossFit in the past or do CrossFit now but it seems that there's a lot of Runners getting into it and it also seems like a much newer thing and because Jason's a little bit more old school I was like maybe it's not going to be that much but it was a lot man it was the the the joke that um\n{ts:2426} I shared with a couple people is you know we did Pro doubles so we're literally on the same team we're wearing the exact same train hard tank like clearly we're teamed up for this and it was funny because we would be running the laps and just random people would be like yeah Jason because they recognize him so they were cheering for me and it\n{ts:2442} was just I was giving him a hard time after there I was like yeah you know I'm here too you know also my name's Gabe I should have put should have put a name tag on but I think that's also a good kind of a litus test for the reach of like the show in YouTube Right obviously and and social right people like because if you didn't have those things right it wouldn't just be people that recognized you from GameStops or whatever yeah yeah\n{ts:2463} for sure I mean obviously it's that reach and then it's also just like a lot of people who evolved with the sport like I did like a lot of people got into the sport I'd say 2010 through 2016 a lot of people entered CrossFit as a sport as a methodology and I was fortunate enough to be you know on TV at\n{ts:2481} that time or whatever right and since then maybe they've kept along with my journey and kind of whatever so when you got there I my training Journey has evolved from you know trying to snatch 350 pounds to and walk on my hands to now where I'm at today trying to be a capable guy a lot of those people have also evolved right where it's not\n{ts:2500} necessarily they're anti- snatching they just don't it doesn't it doesn't drive their passion anymore and HX fulfills some of those things for them like it did for me like I'm down to go run and do whatever but if you ask me to go you know compete Olympic lifting competition I'm probably not down right now it's not that's not that's not a goal of mine you know all right I'm going ask completely\n{ts:2517} completely different question now because that's how I go sometimes when you're watching you watch the games pretty regularly I assume uh I commentated on ESPN Forum last the year before last so yes okay well I don't know where to zoom where to [\u00a0__\u00a0] uh stream anymore so I just go to the YouTube ones because it's like this\n{ts:2535} one's on it you know UPN Network this one's on anyway I'm a boomer yeah anyway so when you see like mados right the first year he won do you does a part of you think like oh boy does this I hope this guy knows what he's in for all the\n{ts:2554} good and the bad and like you know what I'm saying like you know the pressures that come at that level do you think about that stuff no I I mean I'm just I'm just happy for him like I mean whatever I mean because at that point if you can go and win the CrossFit games you've probably had to go and compete in other competitions to get there you've had to overcome something and you you\n{ts:2572} you you just know right um and I think it's evolved over the years like back in the things escalated very quickly now people know that like hey if you win the CrossFit Games you're winning a quarter million dollars you're you're winning like or more and so like it's I think it just comes with the territory and I think you're just grateful to win and then you just got to stay levelheaded right because just because\n{ts:2594} you win yet one year doesn't mean you're gonna be at the top the next year um is that because you're extremely selfish uh I'm me yeah I don't maybe be like like you know what comes with being at the top and and now more than 10 years ago 15 years ago the pressures the\n{ts:2612} amount of like I cuz I putting it this way I don't spend a lot of time around games athletes and I was around a few at this fitfest and I just think I I I see the like these the people that volunteer it's strength and depth is there too right and so people volunteer and they\n{ts:2628} spend a few minutes with um with uh you know obviously Sarah's like the top top right but even just the other ones like there's some like serious worship going on right like there's the pressure of that plus you know just people in your gym plus sponsors it just feels like\n{ts:2646} it's got to be tough me we know all these mental health issues some of these younger gals are having it's a lot yeah you got to surround yourself with good people like I remember I was on the podium with Matt Frasier and he told this story later on I don't I don't remember it but he at the time I I put a social media post up and said hey you know because Frasier took second I took third that was in 2014 and I was like\n{ts:2665} hey go check out Matt Frasier great job blah blah I was just throwing him a bone because I had been in the the business for a long time he came out and got on the podium like without no one really knew he was going to take a Podium spot and I kind of gave him some words like hey man here's my phone number like it gets a little bit wild like hit me up if you ever need anything make sure you\n{ts:2682} have good and he ended up sharing that story later on because I guess it made an impact on him and we stayed in touch and I tried to like help just in some little ways and he had mat O'Keefe which played a huge role for him but I'm bringing that up only to say that like along the journey having people who have done it before you or having someone\n{ts:2699} else to lean on and everybody should have someone like that in their ecosystem that they trust because once you hit that that level of popularity there's a lot of people that are come out of the Woodworks that need something from you and there's a lot of ways they're going to pull you and distract you from your main goal but having someone to keep you grounded in my case like d my wife will come and check my\n{ts:2717} ego every five you know whenever I back then especially having someone to ground you I think is really important and if you don't have kind of what I was asking if you thought about that with like vas that's what I was getting no I mean but with him I I maybe okay let me take it back to like my day yeah I I would I would try and like go up to the younger\n{ts:2734} guys like and even Hepner brought this up on our podcast and just try and give like little words of advice little things here and there just because I had gone through that Evolution for the last 10 years I I would also venture to say and Jason you correct me if I'm wrong I think that it's so different now because the athlete has gotten younger and the stakes seem to be higher\n{ts:2756} in that back in the day when Jason was getting after it like you were competing for the CrossFit games but it was a lot of people that were also on seminar staff they owned gyms like this was onethird of their like paycheck and and like what they were about now especially in the CrossFit space like this is it like these guys are gearing up towards\n{ts:2777} the games and the purse at the games or whatever other big competition they're a lot younger they're this is like the thing that they've maybe known that they wanted to be for as long as they can remember like for a lot of the guys back then this thing came up and it was like this is fun like you know you're just kind of riding the Wave A lot of these\n{ts:2795} especially like the younger female athletes we've talked about this on our podcast it's kind of like the only thing they know and that that puts a lot of pressure in in many ways when you've been like the teen at the games and then you know the youngest women to Podium at the games and then like I can imagine that pressure being very different than\n{ts:2814} you know Jason kipa you know 2008 but I I I mean Jason I'm curious if you dis 100% I mean back in the day just things have evolved and I think I think what's really interesting is there's still a lot of crossw events that are going on and I I think High Rock is on a rocket ship I had a phenomenal a\n{ts:2831} phenomenal experience there that being said um there are a lot of CrossFit events that are still booming right now like the water plas like the Rogue Invitational I think the games dude they've had a lot of changes they got to figure out what they're going to do but the the the sport of CrossFit is still in my opinion well and Alive because\n{ts:2849} they are going to be the athletes who a make obviously a living off of it but also it's very like social media it's very like exciting for people to see them do all this crazy stuff like walking their hands doing back flips and being able to snatch 300 pounds like those are those are different skill sets that are attracting certain people to it\n{ts:2866} compared to hiero that's more of like hey like you have the endurance background you're good at these things combine it but what I do think H Rox has going for is that dude there's going to be world records that are set and people want to see those records get broken and that's exciting and so I think I'm curious how CrossFit kind of like takes\n{ts:2883} some of the what what is growing Hier rocks and maybe incorporates it and I think they could do it I think they could pull some old school like the burden run from the CrossFit Games they repeated it years later I'd be interested to see if someone could beat the previous time you know stuff like that I think is gonna be really exciting to watch in this in the landscape of\n{ts:2901} Fitness I I won't take credit for this idea um take it where did I hear it I heard it somewhere um but how cool would it be if like event one on Friday of this year's CrossFit Games was was high rocks was it was like the exact race and\n{ts:2919} you had all these guys putting up what honestly would be pretty impressive times and then go on in the rest of the weekend like it would be amazing it would be I'm sure that's that's all that's that's Jacob's and I'm sure they dream about that D like it it's just I the biggest thing and and we were\n{ts:2936} talking about this with with Chris Hinshaw is I think that there's more opportunities for both CrossFit and H rocks to help each other than for this to be like a a one to one like One's Gonna Win One's Gonna Lose know I don't I I don't think that either I I think as\n{ts:2952} usual like you talked about the loud the loud minority but again something I took offense to uh was you know people were asking Castro about it and Castro was just like oh we don't put on massive pation events but we did we crush it and it's like okay so you're saying that you\n{ts:2970} have a way to put on a mass patient event gets more people involved makes CrossFit money they're just I'm just not going to do it like do you think somewhere over there they're thinking that like can't we do something like this even at a smaller scale I don't know but I agree with Gabe\n{ts:2988} and I think my point earlier maybe I've adjusted like I do think that H Rock and Crossfit are going to like have this but I I actually think could be a friendly like I think if they if they work together they could dude the thing about it is if you look at the amount of people do H you look at the amount of people do cross it's a fraction of the people in the world like a fraction of a\n{ts:3008} fraction of a fraction and if they come together and somewhow find ways to amplify each other I think could be really successful like and I don't know what they're going to do to do that but I do know there's a lot of crossw gyms that are doing stuff like Hier Roo there's a lot of hrock gyms that are like the proof was in the pudding when we were out at the C High Rock event I'd say about half the people came from a\n{ts:3025} Crosser background half the people came from running and because of that it's like where could they do this in the future so yeah the future looks bright for I think both if they find the right way to to collaborate I'm excited about it and I'm excited for to do another hrock it was a lot of fun all right well you went from maybe I do it if Gabe asked me to I definitely want to do it I\n{ts:3044} do want to do it because I know gab already got buddies he's doing it I'll tell you why I want to do it is because bro we got 106 and I know we can get faster than that that's why I want to do it is because you know gabes running wasn't very good and so we had we had to slow down to make sure that you know he was recovering in time and so so no I'm just\n{ts:3065} kidding I'm talking about myself but I'd like to see a better time than 106 you know last time we got prepared for we we Gabe created this really cool um hybrid hybrid training ebook and so we followed it where it was running and basically some of our Flex bodybuilding combined it and it was a really good combination\n{ts:3083} of that strength conditioning and so um that's where we followed they got me ready for the race I thought we did really well but I know we could do faster Gabe would you say if I were to say to you for someone who's not as sophisticated listen you got to get\n{ts:3101} stronger and then figure out a way to keep your engine going between the stations I mean that's kind of like as simple as it gets right because you could be super fast but your hearts rate Jack and yours toast I see it all the time when I'm when I run I've run a few uh like some doubles and stuff the guys who are\n{ts:3118} shirtless even after the steer station one they went from running around the track to walking on the track so it's right yeah I mean I I mean it it it all comes down to what kind of background are you going into this race with if you're a runner going into it you need to know that like you don't\n{ts:3138} have to worry about the running and you need to Pace those stations and if you're a cross bitter going into it I think that it's it's it's the opposite where like the station are not going to be a problem for you make sure you're pacing the running um and that's a lot of that is going to be learned with you know you doing your first race and like kind of learning the hard way um because\n{ts:3159} a lot of this stuff is much easier said than done because like I said they do such a good job getting you hyped up like it takes a lot to come out of that starting shoot and not go guns blazing because they do a good job you feel like a ro breath breathe in the good [\u00a0__\u00a0] breathe out the bad [\u00a0__\u00a0] bro she was so\n{ts:3177} good man they're so good at this it was so much fun that that shoot that like that whatever you call it was like my favorite part of the whole event that and then obviously finishing but I I agree with Gabe you know like I think if you come from a Crosser background you're not gonna have a problem with any of this stuff like the sled's not that heavy like it's fine it's not it's not\n{ts:3195} the end of the world it's the running it's a lot of running you know and then if you're a runner you you have to develop the capacity in those um in those events especially like the wall balls and the sled um the sled being relatively heavy compared to the rest of the stuff in my opinion where where and I know you guys kind of broke down your\n{ts:3212} whole race but for for for my lers Gabe where were you kind of like surprised the most where where your heart went to a place that you were like oh this is it's too soon for this to be happening well I'll tell you exactly when I we had this plan the whole time because you know I came in with a little bit more running significantly more running\n{ts:3232} Fitness than Jason but Jason but Jason is we were we were making a joke if they ever make an event that is just the stations Zero running I would put Jason up against anyone on the planet to absolutely demolish those stations like all that stuff is geared for Jason's wheelhouse so we're like okay we need to\n{ts:3251} make sure that we're doing the running at a pace that's not gonna you know Crush Jay and then let him you know do his thing on the stations but get a little bit of rest before we did the runs now on the sled push and pull because that sled was honestly surprisingly heavy I would say that that was my biggest surprise was how heavy that sled was especially on the pole and\n{ts:3272} I think part of that is the sled pole specifically I think is honestly the biggest skill that you need to work on you were not 106 by the way I'm sorry you were 10713 oh man had to look it out but the ski like because we didn't have the skill we hadn't practice that and that um the the sled was Heavy Jason had to\n{ts:3291} do a lot more work than we had planned on those stations so I almost felt guilty so going into station for the burpees I was like Jay I got this and I did so many burpees and so fast that we came out of that run and I thought that our race was over I was like I think I went way too much in the red Jason was\n{ts:3310} actually pulling away from me in the run and I was like that's not good but luckily you know like half a lap in I was able to like kind of compose myself and and get after it but goes back to what we were saying before like you're going to learn some of this stuff literally just by doing your first race because everyone's going to be different\n{ts:3327} but you have to remember that in all the stations it's going to take you significant effort to maybe go 10 15 20 seconds faster and you're going to pay a lot more than 10 15 seconds on the run if you if you bake yourself too much a lot more than that you're gonna pay like\n{ts:3344} two minutes on the run so it's never worth it yeah you're you're your run after that was a 502 it looks like yeah it wasn't pretty dude we had a okay well we had a long course um it was um Jason heard that Jason heard or\n{ts:3364} read that somewhere and now whenever we talk about that High Rock race he talks about the fact that it was a long course that's that's what they said um but Matt I gotta I gotta jump onto a meeting but I wanted to say man we're I'm I'm always down to talk about high rocks I think you know come to think of it maybe Gabe what I should do is I should just in our local in the gym just do the 10 or just\n{ts:3383} do the obstacle the the the only and just like put a timeout to the world hey if you're not down with the run you just want to do these obstacles here's my score I think that's a good way to do it well real quick before I let you go when it first came to Miami in 2019 and they they they called Hunter and said hey Hunter can you get some observations to do and at the time sub hour was huge\n{ts:3403} like only one person had done it or nobody had done it and all these guys did Sims in their gyms including the runs and they all smashed it and then they got in the race and everybody got demolished because it's like you know it's a lot different like in the in the gym versus whatever but no you should definitely do a stations only uh thing I'm trying it we're going to do it we'll film it all right well listen let's\n{ts:3422} let's keep chatting thanks for coming on we'll uh we'll talk soon thank you see you guys see you all right",

And not only is Rich a fantastic Hi-Rox athlete, he also puts out some of the very best content in the Hi-Rox space. He hosts the excellent RMR training podcast along with Jacoby and Ryan Kent. Rich also has a fantastic YouTube channel, which you can find by searching Rich Ryan in YouTube. And he covers all kinds of topics such as how to improve at every single\n\nwhy you should be doing more threshold running and why high rock simulations probably aren\u2019t the best way to train. Rich Ryan, welcome to the show.\n\nRich Ryan (00:34)\n\nCool, John, appreciate it. Thank you for that intro.\n\nJohn (00:37)\n\nNow, Rich, I\u2019m curious to hear your overall reflections on your season. So you\u2019ve had some phenomenal race results. You ran a 54-28 Hirox Pro time in Chicago, which was one of the very fastest times we saw all season. You also ran the very fastest time in the men\u2019s pro doubles with a 48-31 with Pelleo Mendez in Miami. And then Hirox World Championships, you finished 11th overall. How do you reflect on your season? Are you content with how it\u2019s played out?\n\nRich Ryan (01:07)\n\nSo yeah, overall I\u2019m happy, right? Like the way that I was able to make this type of progress over the course of the past several months, like I\u2019ve been doing and involved with Hirox basically since I\u2019ve been able to in 2021 is kind of when it came state side. And I\u2019ve been trying to train and refine and just like really figure out the best way to do this. I thought it would be an avenue that I could be fairly competitive in.\n\nAnd it just took a long time to just really figure out the best route for me and not worry about what everyone else is doing and not like overthinking, not over train. And I turned 39 this year, I\u2019ll be 40 next year. And to, so to make that type of progress, it\u2019s just like very encouraging, you know, and just like being able to feel like I am able to improve in terms of like the results, you know, like the way that things kind of ended, there\u2019s something, there\u2019s, there\u2019s definitely some to be desired, but\n\nI\u2019m happy with how I raced. How I\u2019ve really had to approach this race over the course of several years is just with too much respect and just really slow playing it trying to build up. And I never really put my hat in the ring to try to win a race, especially in the biggest stage. So I\u2019m very happy that I did that. I tried my hardest to race with those guys up front. And when a group of guys go out,\n\nusually only two end up coming out the other side and one ends up ultimately winning. Very rarely you\u2019ll see a group of five or six dudes competing until the very end of a race. People get spit out and I just happen to be one of the athletes that got spit out. So 11th place I don\u2019t think is indicative in terms of where I was compared to the competitive field this year. But it\u2019s the result that I got on it. But I\u2019m happy with the race that I ran there. So, apart from reflection, it\u2019s encouraging that I...\n\nwas able to get that much better, especially at this age. And I feel like I\u2019m onto some really interesting things. had a lot of fun in training and I am just like optimistic for the next season for sure.\n\nJohn (03:04)\n\nYeah, 100%. And I definitely want to cover what you\u2019ve been learning about your training over this past year, because it\u2019s been very interesting to see how your training has seemed to evolve. But let\u2019s talk a little bit more about that World Championships. So you went into the race with this very optimistic mindset. You went in to win the race. What did that first run and that first ski-urg feel like? What was that pace right at the front of the race?\n\nRich Ryan (03:26)\n\nYeah, for sure. Like I thought I was going to win. Like in my brain, I was like, I\u2019m going to win. And I think there\u2019s a lot in these races and it doesn\u2019t, and it never comes out that way, but I still have the belief in myself to think that I have a chance to win and that I have the fitness. And when it comes down to it, have the grit of it, but yes, I was never prepared to, I was, I never had the firsthand experience of going out that hard in the first run and at world championships, that first run was actually a little bit longer in Chicago. So\n\nBut I knew I had to run fitness to engage. And I thought just the way that my training was going that I would be able to weather that storm. And I prepared for that. In my training, I would go out and run really fast up front and then just try to settle things in and then see what would happen on the back half of the race. it felt like in the moment, I was like, I\u2019m here. I can be here. I\u2019m not overextended.\n\nupon reflection, if it did feel fast, it was definitely a fast way to, enter, that race. And, but again, I don\u2019t have any regrets for it. And it\u2019s just a matter of understanding how I can then take that feeling that came of that first run, like later in the race and how I can adjust my training to kind of train for that, where this being my first crack at really going out extremely hard. I just wasn\u2019t experienced.\n\nYou know, so I didn\u2019t have a good understanding of what it was actually to feel like. So I did my best to train that way, but without the race experience hip, it was a, it was a lofty goal for sure.\n\nJohn (04:58)\n\nYeah, it\u2019s a lofty goal, but it\u2019s exactly what we want to see, like, especially as people watching you race. We want to see you race with ambition. So I\u2019m very glad as a spectator that you decided to take that approach, Rich. And \u2053 let\u2019s talk a little bit about the sleds. So you actually had the fastest time on the day on the sled push. You had the second fastest time on sled pull. What do you think enabled you to do so well on sleds?\n\nRich Ryan (05:08)\n\nAppreciate that.\n\nSo when I first started doing high rocks, the sleds were the thing that I was not sure I was gonna even be able to finish. Like I was so scared of the sleds that first race that I ran, this was like in 2021. And there wasn\u2019t as much access, right? Like an affiliate gym wasn\u2019t a thing. There wasn\u2019t really, like you could find sleds here or there, but I really had to go out of my way and I had no idea how it was gonna feel. And I just saw people getting killed by the sleds left and right.\n\nAnd that first like season, I also got killed. I was able to do it, but I was like, it really took the toll on me as a, as a runner coming into it. I didn\u2019t have like an extensive strength background. I had some for sure. So I was really cautious and concerned about what the sludge was going to be like and leading up into, like this past several seasons, I remained cautious. And there was one race that happened in, in Spain, in Madrid. went to Madrid to go get a time.\n\nIdeally to get into the majors. This was the 23, 24 season. And I went over there and just got crushed. And then I reflected and I realized that I was racing scared. I was afraid of these sleds. And in that moment, after that race, I like, just need to double down. I just need to make this. I need to be good at this. There\u2019s no reason I can\u2019t excel here if I put my attention and my physical effort here instead of just trying to manage it. And kind of like,\n\nlooking at myself and being like, I\u2019m just not good at sleds. Like, no, like I just haven\u2019t really tried to get better at the sleds. I haven\u2019t tried to train hard. I haven\u2019t tried to race them well. And so that was, so like being able to have that kind of light turn on for me, it\u2019s been about a year and half process, but like really focusing on training hard on the sleds. And that\u2019s with compromised running workouts. That\u2019s with like standalone sled workouts and figuring out the right balance of\n\nLoad and intensity and how to really improve like it just feels good, It\u2019s again It\u2019s encouraging to see what like the hard work can do even within a specific station. So And that was kind of a that was all my races this year I was able to race really well through the sleds I probably went a little bit too a little bit too hard on the sleds at Worlds and that was another reason why things kind of came out the other side but like knowing that that work pays off\n\nAgain, it leaves me optimistic. Where else can I improve then in this sport?\n\nJohn (07:42)\n\nYeah, that must be super encouraging to basically identify an issue you had and then you basically tackled it and now you\u2019re one of the very best at the sleds. So walk us a little bit more through that playbook. So if you had to summarize what it takes to get very good at sled push and very good at sled pull, what are the essential components? What do people really need to be paying attention to?\n\nRich Ryan (08:03)\n\nSo my process through this, I was like, I\u2019m just going to push it a bunch all the time. I\u2019m just going to do it four times a week. And ultimately that was too much. I started feeling a little bit lower leg pain, foot pain, and it was like, I might be overdoing it here. how it kind of looks now, it\u2019s two times per week, and it\u2019s not necessarily a linear progression. And that\u2019s something that I\u2019ve kind of leaned on a little bit too much. It\u2019s like, OK, this week we\u2019re like an example linear progression would be.\n\nThis week I\u2019m pushing it three by 25 meters. Next week I\u2019ll push it three by 37 meters and then I\u2019ll do like four by 25 meters. Something like that where it would be like continuously progressing up. I took a more undulated progression approach where it would be this week the load is gonna be very heavy for short. This week it\u2019s going to be a little bit lighter and fast. This week will be lighter and just like long. So trying to hit it from all different angles because as we\u2019re seeing, right, like it\u2019s hard to really know what you\u2019re going to get on race day.\n\nSo kind of being prepared for all of it\u2019s very helpful. And then kind of rotating between those three modalities, like heavy and short, like heavy, like heavy and short. And then I also have these workouts where it would just be like, I\u2019m going to do unbroken lengths at all costs. And just like, I\u2019m going to do 25 or 37 meters or 50 meters unbroken and then rest for however long that takes. We could be like,\n\nfour to six minutes and then try to repeat that. So there\u2019s like a strength component, there\u2019s a speed component, and then there\u2019s like a lactate byproduct tolerance component. And so trying to tackle all of those three, and if you come into the sled training session with some kind of intent that way, it\u2019s like, hey, what do need to work on? Do I need to just like get stronger globally so I can move this thing? Or is it like, do my legs start to burn up and like this byproduct is like slowing me down? Do I just need to get a little bit more tolerant at that?\n\nOr am I just like too slow? Like if I spend less time moving the sled because I\u2019m like going faster, will that be helpful? So I think it tackling it from all three of those, those directions. And then as it gets closer into like the race itself, like in like your training block, then I would do one, one of those workouts per week where it\u2019d be kind of addressing one of those three pillars. And then I would do something that is going to be a little bit more compromised. So in these compromised running workouts, I still like it to be like higher output.\n\nI found like if you\u2019re doing a workout and you\u2019re pushing a sled 30 minutes into the workout, it\u2019s just like really slow and it\u2019s really taxing. So I always try to load the sled in like the front of those like compromised running workouts, like a tempo type workouts.\n\nJohn (10:39)\n\nAmazing. So you\u2019ve got those three pillars, you\u2019ve got the strength pillar, you\u2019ve got the speed pillar, and you\u2019ve also got this lactic clearance pillar. And each of your sled workouts is designed around hitting one of those specific objectives. How do you think about the the pure strength training side of the sled training? So we\u2019ve had a lot of people say, you know, it\u2019s about improving just strength overall, maybe you need to get better at the back squat, at the deadlift. Do you feel like people really should be training the sleds directly, or do you think...\n\nSome of the supplemental training is equally or even more important.\n\nRich Ryan (11:10)\n\nI think that the specific training is going to be better bang for buck and it\u2019s going to move the needle the most. I think a lot of it comes down to just recoverability. your own sled, you\u2019re not getting any eccentric load. As your muscle is lengthening, it\u2019s not being, it\u2019s not pushing, there\u2019s not weight pushing against you. It\u2019s almost all concentric movement because it\u2019s not vertical, it\u2019s not up and down, it\u2019s horizontal. So you\u2019re just pushing into it and it\u2019s not pressing into you.\n\nJohn (11:17)\n\nOkay.\n\nRich Ryan (11:37)\n\nas your muscles are lengthening, which creates a lot of that muscle damage in a back squat or deadlift or Bulgarian split squat or lunges, right, where it\u2019s loaded directly on top of you. That\u2019s why you get that real nasty soreness. So I just feel like the recoverability from traditional strength training is, there\u2019s definitely some carryover, but if you\u2019re pinched on time and you just need to get better at the sleds, doing the sleds I think is going to just be better.\n\nJohn (12:07)\n\nSo in your own training, are you putting less of an emphasis on pure strength training than you have in the past?\n\nRich Ryan (12:14)\n\nYeah, it depends on where it is in terms of my season. When I first started, like I mentioned, I was a straight-up runner guy. I had some CrossFit background. I can\u2019t say I was a straight-up runner, but there was times where I just was focused on running when the sport happened again, and I needed to move into more of a hypertrophy phase.\n\nRight, like I identified, it\u2019s like, I\u2019m not strong enough, I\u2019m not big enough, I need to improve on that. So I\u2019ve done pieces where I needed to put on muscle and to do that, that eccentric loading that creates that muscle damage is like critical, right? Like the muscle damage is essentially what creates the muscle growth. So I did those phases because I needed to get bigger and stronger. Um, but now it\u2019s kind of like, yeah, like if I get hurt doing a deadlift, like I\u2019m just going to feel so stupid.\n\nYou know, I already know I\u2019m like strong enough. have like the requisite Strength and now if I can like put it out as much as I can like in the specifics Where I do like to do is just for the variety, right? Just for like the the palatability of training where it\u2019s like I haven\u2019t done squats in a while Let\u2019s see. Let\u2019s do some front squats. Let\u2019s put in like a metcon. I like doing deadlifts I just like enjoy it. So that\u2019s where I think there\u2019s like good place for it But I don\u2019t I don\u2019t do too too much of that and I\u2019m in like an offseason block a little bit now\n\nJohn (13:03)\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nRich Ryan (13:30)\n\nSo I\u2019ll be doing a little more frequently in strength, but come the season, I do like one strength day per week. And a lot of it is like either accessory work to build specific strength for the station work, or it is like just the station work.\n\nJohn (13:43)\n\nWow. Okay. So you\u2019ll maybe, so in terms of movements like back squat and the deadlift, what I\u2019m hearing you saying, Rich, is that during the season, you\u2019re maybe hitting this once a week, if that, is that correct? If that.\n\nRich Ryan (13:55)\n\nIf that, like back\n\nsquats in season, like I\u2019m almost not doing it all. It\u2019s just like too much and like figuring out like what the appropriate load is going to be and like how I want to approach it is a work in progress as well. Like if I can put this in place, like how does it look in terms of like volume and load and intent? but in season, like, yeah, not, not really at all.\n\nJohn (14:17)\n\nOkay, okay. And do you have a sense of what you could do for those major lifts? So even though you\u2019re not practicing them on a regular basis, what kind of strength do you think you\u2019re at during a typical high rock season in terms of what you could be placing on the bar?\n\nRich Ryan (14:31)\n\nYeah, that\u2019s a great question. So like my all time life, my lifetime PRs are in the back squat, it\u2019s 325, the deadlift is 405, I\u2019m talking pounds, and my bench is 245. So in season, I think my bench would probably be pretty close to that, like that\u2019s like a newer thing, doing more bench press. Deadlift, I could probably pull like 380 and back squat,\n\nmaybe 300, I would say 280, 285, I think, if I worked up and had a belt on and had the lifter shoes, the knees, the whole deal. So I don\u2019t know what percentage is that. You got a percentage brain like that that you can run those percentages like that?\n\nJohn (15:14)\n\n\n\nWhat is it? It\u2019s like 80 to 90 percent like like in my in my mind. thinking this isn\u2019t that far off\n\nRich Ryan (15:20)\n\nYeah, and that\u2019s something that I\u2019ve been interested in what you think on your end. And in general, to maintain strength, doesn\u2019t take that much. To maintain your speed and your turnover as a runner, or just your speed in general, that does take some frequency to maintain that, and those diminish pretty quick. But strength gains, they kind of stick around. So as long as you\u2019re doing something heavy, I found the sled push, in particular for my front squat for some reason.\n\nJohn (15:43)\n\nYeah.\n\nRich Ryan (15:48)\n\nthat translates because I think it is a little bit more quad heavy. if I\u2019m doing heavy sled pulls, it\u2019s not directly the same as a deadlift, but I\u2019m still moving something pretty heavy. So strength gains are easy to maintain, and so is muscle mass. Muscle mass is on, it\u2019s real hard to lose it unless you\u2019re actually trying to.\n\nJohn (16:05)\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah, that\u2019s actually been one of the biggest surprises for me this season. So in terms of my background, I\u2019ve typically done a lot of power lifting. So I\u2019ve really focused on that squat deadlift bench. And probably for my first year and a half, I was really focusing primarily on those movements. But over the past eight months, I\u2019ve really tried to dial in more of those high rock circuits. And in terms of doing a Dexter scan, so I did look at body composition. And one thing that surprised me is that the muscle mass pretty much did not change at all. So even though I\u2019m not doing that power lifting,\n\nRich Ryan (16:34)\n\nRight?\n\nJohn (16:36)\n\nthat bodybuilding work, the muscle mass is still staying there just from those high rocks movements. So I think that\u2019s one of the things that has surprised me about training for high rocks.\n\nRich Ryan (16:44)\n\nAnd your body fat percentage is probably down with all the aerobic and cardio stuff. Yeah, what have you found in terms of how to implement the power lifts? Like are you still trying to hang on to it or are you just kind of like, how\u2019s that looking on your end?\n\nJohn (16:46)\n\nYeah, no, it\u2019s come down a little bit and\n\nYeah. So I\u2019ve, I\u2019ve dramatically reduced the amount of powerlifting that I\u2019m doing. And for me, my, my strength numbers are similar to yours. So in terms of where I\u2019ve been in terms of my max strengths. So in a similar way, I\u2019ve realized that\u2019s definitely not the limitation for me personally. So for me personally, the limiter, it\u2019s not even the running for me. It\u2019s really just the, just the being able to go five minutes on the station without completely fatiguing. So that\u2019s been the thing that I\u2019ve been really trying to dial in. So\n\nRich Ryan (17:24)\n\nMm.\n\nJohn (17:27)\n\nSo yeah, so honestly, in terms of powerlifting, I\u2019ve just almost completely dropped it for the moment. But now that I\u2019m heading towards an off season, I will be picking some of that back up again.\n\nRich Ryan (17:35)\n\nRight, because it\u2019s almost like the opposite end of what you need to work on. You just need to work on the totality of the race and the totality of just all of the stations. So doing 20 seconds of work with two minute rest, it\u2019s like not going to do it.\n\nJohn (17:51)\n\nExactly,\n\nexactly, Okay, Rich, so the sleds, that\u2019s clearly one of these areas that you\u2019ve gotten a lot better.\n\nWhat are some of the other areas where you feel like you\u2019ve really improved and made progress this season?What do you think has really resulted in those faster times?\n\nRich Ryan (18:03)\n\nSo yeah, when I look at it all, because my background is running and then I started doing CrossFit, my strength background comes from the CrossFit world, that\u2019s where I\u2019ve done a lot of learning and practicing. So I felt like I had the pieces on both ends and then when I was looking at it was like, how is it that I could beat these athletes in a race from whatever, like 5K to half marathon and I could do\n\nlike lift as much and also do like Metcons faster than them. Like why am I like in this race, am I not performing against them as well as I think I should? And to me it really boils down to the\n\ntotality of the race. Kind of just like I saying, it\u2019s like, was, it\u2019s just long. It is just a long race. I\u2019m a runner, but I\u2019m a middle distance runner by, by my background, right? So races between, you know, four and.\n\nJohn (18:47)\n\nYeah.\n\nRich Ryan (18:55)\n\n15 minutes is really where I spent most of my athletic career in endurance. And then when I\u2019m moving into a race that\u2019s 60 minutes, 60 minutes plus, it\u2019s like, it\u2019s a different style of training. So I was trying to apply all these things that I like to do, which is middle distance, intervals, shorter pieces, and then putting that just in like building more volume around that same style. So really what I needed to do and what I wasn\u2019t that interested in doing was just like,\n\ndoing\n\nlonger grindy workouts and just like spending time in this area of discomfort that to me is not incredibly familiar. And, but like once I knew if I could just take these pieces that I had built and then just put this base of like what we call like strength in the endurance world, right? Like this, this like aerobic strength and just something that I could do for longer amounts of time. It\u2019s like, it\u2019s like, just had to suck it up and do it. You know, it like, it was right there. It like the one thing I wasn\u2019t doing. And I was like trying to work my way around it, trying to like.\n\nJohn (19:47)\n\nYeah.\n\nRich Ryan (19:51)\n\nNegotiate with myself to be like, you know what? Maybe this will this will work if I do these intervals do more of them\n\nBut it\u2019s like I just needed to go hard for 20 minutes until it felt terrible and then sit there for 30 more minutes and now it was like kind of that simple and then it just like really opened up theLike the possibilities in terms of like how I could adjust those and make training a little bit more fun because I able to kind of explore new things\n\nJohn (20:04)\n\nMmm.\n\nRich Ryan (20:15)\n\nSo I think that was a really helpful kind of realization that I had.\n\nJohn (20:20)\n\nAnd that\u2019s just giving you this overall better endurance later into the race, I imagine.\n\nRich Ryan (20:26)\n\nFor sure. with the precursor to this, was just trying to think, how could I do this smarter? Because I was just doing a lot of things, and I was thinking.\n\nAnd then I kind of turned to the triathlete world, because those athletes, it\u2019s multi-discipline, and they just do a ton of volume, and they\u2019re really dialed in.They have a lot of tech in the way that they do it. And I just thought, and what I realized, they would be.\n\ntrying to figure out what kind of metric they could follow to like guide their training. And so I decided to like really\n\nlearn more about like heart rate trainingand how we could apply it to high rocks. And then like trying to like, I understood where, kind of like energy system I needed to develop and like where I needed to be for this totality of the race, right? We want to sit like right around that anaerobic threshold zone, which is like,\n\nYou\u2019re like low zone four, it\u2019s at this piece that if you cross this line, your fatigue will jump exponentially, but if you sit right under it, you could hang there for about an hour of racing. It\u2019s like, okay, well that\u2019s what I need to do. I\u2019m gonna race for about an hour.\n\nSo I started to track how much time I was spending in this specific zone, and then just building my progression based off of that. So I was like, okay, this workout\u2019s gonna be 20 minutes at zone four, and then it was like 25 minutes, and then that was linear progression.\n\nAnd then building that up and trying to find a sweet spot for how much time I could spend there in training without cooking myself. So that was a huge shift in my training.\n\nAnd that was like basically the only metric that I really followed for the whole year.\n\nJohn (21:51)\n\nHmm.\n\nWell, yeah, that\u2019s absolutely fascinating. So, okay, so you\u2019re looking at this time spent in low zone four. So would this be a little bit of a lower heart rate compared to traditional running threshold? Or how would you benchmark it against just a pure running threshold workout?\n\nRich Ryan (22:15)\n\nSo it would be, right, so it\u2019s because we\u2019re multi-modality, the heart rate doesn\u2019t transfer like one-to-one from running into like all this stuff that we\u2019re doing. But we\u2019re doing a lot of running, right? So we can, like I have just like drew that line, be like we can make it like a one-to-one if I\u2019m running and if I cross over into this like zone four area that I need to be and then I keep my effort high.\n\nand I go do a sled push or a row or a row or a ski or whatever and my heart rate drops because the positions that I\u2019m in change, I still count it. I\u2019m like, did not, I\u2019m not going out of my threshold because my heart rate dipped. As long as my effort stays high, then I\u2019m just like counting it all the way through. And then I get back on the runner and it pops back up. And that\u2019s thing that was a little bit challenging. And there was a lot of trial and error there trying to figure out where my heart rate zones.\n\nJohn (22:51)\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nRich Ryan (23:09)\n\nwould be based off of different movements that I was doing, because as your body changes positions, your heart is going to be asked to do a different effort. So if you\u2019re sitting on the rower, you\u2019re sitting. Half of your body is horizontal, which is gonna be easier for your heart to pump blood to, as opposed to standing, like if you\u2019re running. You\u2019re not working as much gravity. So your heart rate\u2019s gonna come down a little bit. Your effort might not change, and the lactic byproduct that\u2019s happening\n\nJohn (23:29)\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nRich Ryan (23:32)\n\nthat lactate doesn\u2019t change. And that\u2019s basically what we\u2019re going for. So I kind of had to just understand how that worked across all the modalities and just be like, I feel like I\u2019m there. And then you can be a little bit RPE once I\u2019ve kind of figured that out over the course of like,\n\nseveral months.\n\nJohn (23:49)\n\nOkay. Yeah. So I really want to keep on drilling into this because I do feel like this is really a key part of training. So give us more of a sense for what exactly that RP would be. So is it like an eight or nine out of 10? And how does it compare to a race effort?\n\nRich Ryan (24:03)\n\nSo because these intervals are longer,\n\nthey\u2019re gonna be 40, 55 minutes, it needs to start at a lower RPE than say if you went to the track and did 10 by three minutes where it could be like an eight, eight and a half. This is probably gonna be like a seven, seven and a half and it\u2019s gonna take about 10 or 12 minutes for you to actually get into that zone for as opposed to doing shorter intervals where you can go a little bit faster to get.\n\nthat amount of time there. So I would say it of starts at seven and half and I try to keep my wits about me so I\u2019m not like, this is a race effort. So it\u2019s gonna be like slightly below. And so the goal for this is volume. And if we are pushing the intensity a little bit too much, it\u2019s going to reduce the amount of time we could actually spend in this zone.\n\nJohn (24:40)\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nRich Ryan (24:54)\n\nSo once we\u2019re there, and that\u2019s where the metric is a nice thing to have, like a heart rate is nice to have, so you can be like, I\u2019m still there and the work is still being done, so I don\u2019t need to go any faster. So it kind of ends up probably being like 8 and 1 by the end, but I try to keep it away from race effort.\n\nJohn (25:08)\n\nYeah.\n\nOkay, so it\u2019s slightly below race effort, but if people out there are listening and they\u2019re starting to do these kinds of workouts, maybe the feeling is that it\u2019s similar to a race. So it\u2019s not quite a race effort, but it\u2019s gonna feel hard. It\u2019s gonna feel like you are really working and this is the type of workout you\u2019re gonna get a benefit from. Is that a good way to think about it?\n\nRich Ryan (25:28)\n\nYeah, that\u2019s like if you want to just make it straight up intuitive, right? Like we want to try to chase the feeling of the race, you know.\n\nJohn (25:35)\n\nYeah, so you\u2019re\n\nchasing the feeling of the race. Maybe you\u2019re not quite getting there, but it\u2019s getting close. It\u2019s getting close and yeah.\n\nRich Ryan (25:39)\n\nYou\u2019re getting close. You\u2019re just not gritting your teeth so that you\u2019re like,\n\nyou\u2019re not like, like, I need to push through this, whatever.\n\nYou\u2019re just like, I\u2019m just going to sit here. I\u2019m just going to sit here. I\u2019m just going to take it.\n\nJohn (25:46)\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay. And Rich, obviously you\u2019ve built up your capacity to be able to do workouts like this. So give us a sense of, you know, in that peak block leading up to Worlds,\n\nhow many days a week were you doing workouts like this? And give us a sense for the total amount of volume that you were doing on a weekly basis in this zone. Were you tracking that?\n\nRich Ryan (26:06)\n\nI was tracking that. was really the main metric that I was tracking was how much time I would accumulate here.\n\nSo at its peak, if I was getting like 100 minutes, so like it would be like two efforts of, yeah, like 50 minutes, that\u2019s about as much as I could really tolerate there.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve played around with different frequency, Doing it like a double threshold, right? We\u2019ll just call that what it is. Doing a threshold session in the morning and the evening. It\u2019s a great way to accumulate more time.\n\nBut I found the recoverability from that was harder on me, because I got less recovery time, than actually the huge dose.So the dosage, I like to be a little bit bigger. Whereas some people do respond a little bit better to the shorter doses more frequently. But that just didn\u2019t work for me.\n\nJohn (26:50)\n\nSo looking at the other competitors in the elite 15, do you have a sense that this type of workout has also been critical for their success as well? So maybe let me phrase the question this way. Do you feel like you could pretty much align people up in terms of their race performance by how much time they\u2019re spending executing?\n\nthis type of workout. How predictive do you feel like this is in terms of ultimate performance?\n\nRich Ryan (27:14)\n\nthat I\u2019ve honestly never even thought about that. I, don\u2019t know. I think there, and this is, this comes away for like my theory on this is there are different types of athletes in terms of what they can tolerate from like a physical, like discomfort standpoint that I think some athletes, they might do better with the smaller frequencies. And then on race day, can like,\n\nwith more frequency, I\u2019m sorry, with smaller dosage, that they can just kind of run through a wall if they need to. If called upon, they\u2019ll be able to just really grit their teeth and have this fire in them that no matter what, I think Hunter\u2019s a great example. I think Lauren Weeks is a great example of that. Where it\u2019s just like, they\u2019re just so tough that they can just blast through it. So they might do better with these smaller doses of threshold and higher intensity pieces because when push comes to shove, they\u2019re just gonna be able to do it.\n\nAnd maybe there\u2019s some genetic component that like of aerobic capacity or maybe they have a bigger aerobic base or whatever that allows them to do that. But for me, I need to like feel it and I need to feel like pretty often, like if I\u2019m not doing like the specific feeling, like I don\u2019t respond very well, like emotionally. So like this is less of from like the nuts and bolts of like how well people are going to respond to actual training. So I think it\u2019s, so.\n\nJohn (28:17)\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nRight, right.\n\nRich Ryan (28:30)\n\nanswer your question. No, I don\u2019t think, I don\u2019t think so. think some people might do this and they might just like feel sluggish, might not feel fast enough or they might want to go harder. other people might, might like how I am like who need to like sit there and feel it. And that might be, be predictive, but, I I wouldn\u2019t think so. I w I\u2019m going to go, I\u2019m going to say no, I don\u2019t think that is how it can be.\n\nJohn (28:48)\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nIt\u2019s so interesting how there seems to be many different pathways towards getting a very fast high rocks time. And it doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s a uniform optimal athlete profile yet, which I think is what makes the sport so interesting.\n\nRich Ryan (29:01)\n\nSo you\u2019re talking to people, what are you thinking? Where are you leaning on this?\n\nJohn (29:04)\n\nSo I think you see a lot of different backgrounds coming into Hirox. You definitely see people coming more from the CrossFit side. And I think on the surface level, a lot of people would expect those athletes to do better. They see the strength component of Hirox, they see the sleds, they see the lunges, they see the warbles. think someone from a CrossFit background, they\u2019re the ones who are going to do well. I think in reality, what we\u2019re seeing is that the triathletes and the people more from the endurance background tend to have an easier transition. I\u2019d say runners tend to do\n\npretty well also, but the thing about triathletes is that they also have this strength endurance side, which they\u2019re getting from the cycling in particular, which seems to be making the transition even easier. So, so far I\u2019m thinking that kind of background might have a slight benefit, but yeah, I think in terms of the specific program that\u2019s right for a specific person, it really does depend on their background as well.\n\nRich Ryan (29:57)\n\nYeah, that\u2019s a great way to put it. And I\u2019ve thought about this too, right? Like if you take a triathlete straight off of a triathlon and take a crossfit athlete straight off a crossfit competition, you make them do a high rocks. The crossfitters probably going to win the first one. But if you haven\u2019t trained for high rocks for a year, the triathlete is going to win the next one. Just once they get a feel for like, once they can get the required strength and figure out what the actual demands are, their aerobic base and capacity is just like so much more elevated.\n\nYeah, it\u2019s interesting. I don\u2019t think the high level runners haven\u2019t, and like, yeah, I was thinking that like, I think I was the only collegiate runner in the Elite 15. And on the women\u2019s side, I think it is just Meg. I know Sinebent is a pretty, pretty accomplished runner, but it\u2019s not as many runners as you would think. That it is just like, such a running dominated sport. But yeah, and I think as we progress, right, like kind of how we saw in CrossFit.\n\nJohn (30:46)\n\nAll\n\nRich Ryan (30:56)\n\nlike younger athletes see it and then they start training for it. So we\u2019re going to start to see people without broad backgrounds and their background is going to be high rocks. So then\n\nJohn (31:06)\n\n100%. Yeah.\n\nWe really haven\u2019t seen this generation of athletes come in that are focused on high rocks from the get go. Like we haven\u2019t seen any 13 to 14 year olds like really commit to taking up high rocks and then really peeking in their early to mid twenties. Like that just hasn\u2019t happened yet.\n\nRich Ryan (31:20)\n\nIt\u2019s actually, like I was looking back at some old results and the first Hi-Rox event in 2018 was won by Lucas Storath and Alex Ronkovich got second. He must have been at the time, Alex I think is like 32 now, so how many years, seven years, so what was he? Early, mid-20s or whatever. Still not his background. But Tim Vynas ran that race and he must have been, yeah, he was basically a kid, right? So and now.\n\nJohn (31:39)\n\nYes, yes, yes. As an 18 year old, I believe.\n\nRich Ryan (31:45)\n\nHe\u2019s the world champ. So that could, in like four or five years, there could be like three or four Tim Vineshes each year. And all of a sudden, Thiele 15 is 15, 27 to 25 year olds. know, so I think it will happen, but, but right now it\u2019s like, you got old guys like me out there that, that are still just plugging away. But, but yeah, cause everyone has a different background, but soon it\u2019s going to be like their background is high rocks.\n\nJohn (32:00)\n\nYeah, I think so too.\n\n100%. Yeah, it\u2019s coming. It\u2019s coming. Yeah. yeah, in some ways it\u2019s a very special era to see the average age of the elite athletes being 32 years old. yeah. And then we got Rich Ryan, 39, still plugging away and still doing it exceptionally. \u2053\n\nRich Ryan (32:23)\n\nRight.\n\nHangin\u2019 in there. Hangin\u2019 in there. Yeah, so\n\nwe\u2019ll definitely see how that changes in the next, like, this is, yeah, this is the early era stuff. In 10 years, if this is still a thing, it\u2019s not gonna be like this.\n\nJohn (32:38)\n\nYeah, okay. So, Rich, let\u2019s talk a little bit more about that age side. I think on the one hand, I think a lot of people are very inspired by your example. think, you know, me personally, I\u2019m in my early thirties, but I see what you\u2019ve been able to do as a 39 year old. And it just, it gives me incredible motivation to know that that\u2019s possible, but help me understand like, what are some of the challenge or the limitations that you feel like you\u2019ve been running into as, as you have been approaching this new era?\n\nRich Ryan (33:03)\n\nYeah, like and how we touched in the beginning I feel like I\u2019m still improving right I feel like if I put my focus towards something I am able to Improve at the rate at what rate am I improving versus what rate could I have improved? In my like mid 20s who\u2019s to say right?\n\nBut I think a lot of limitations in this sport in general do come from over training I think one of the hardest things about high rocks is not over training\n\nJohn (33:08)\n\nYes, yes.\n\nRich Ryan (33:33)\n\nthat honestly, and I think a lot of the younger athletes who are coming in don\u2019t have a specific maturity level in terms of their training. So they just run into setbacks.And I\u2019m at this point now where I think it\u2019s an advantage to understand like what I am capable of doing in training and doing it repeatedly and not being able to not having to have some injury pop up or have to miss workouts. Like two or three years ago when I was doing a little bit, I was doing a lot more just like\n\neverything. I was just doing a ton of everything and I just was like missing all my workouts but didn\u2019t really realize it because I was still completing them but I wasn\u2019t hitting them with the intent that I really needed to like the intensity wasn\u2019t there to really move the needle. So that is something that I\u2019ve actually used to my advantage and taking like strategic rest days making sure that when I show up to a quality session that I\u2019m going to be able to put out everything that I can.\n\nOr in the past I was kind of like, yeah, I\u2019m working on fatigued legs, that\u2019s good. In retrospect, that\u2019s not good. If the workouts aren\u2019t going well, that\u2019s bad. So understanding that that is really the thing that I need to put a focus on. For most athletes my age, it\u2019s gonna be time. For most athletes who do have regular jobs, it\u2019s time. I\u2019m lucky enough, I wouldn\u2019t consider myself a full-time athlete, but I have a lot of time to train, so I...\n\nI\u2019m able to craft that into my life. One thing that will start, that does seem, again, I\u2019m not sure, because I\u2019ve never, as we get older, the movement quality piece kind of suffers. Our patterns are just wired and we just kind of continuously move in ways that are less advantageous and it just makes the movement quality worse and worse and worse. And the longer time that we\u2019re alive, the more time that we have.\n\nto move poorly. And this is something that I feel like I\u2019ve just had to do a lot of undoing with pain in lower back, knee pain, ankle pain. So general pain, I think, is a limiter for a lot of athletes who are in their mid to late 30s, mid to late 40s and above. So making sure I\u2019m spending time undoing those things. And if I run out of time there, that I think could be an issue.\n\nJohn (35:32)\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nYeah, I think you\u2019ve mentioned a little bit of struggling with the lunges in particular this season. yeah, yeah. So how did you, how were you able to work around that? Or what was your strategy for dealing with some of that pain?\n\nRich Ryan (35:50)\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nIt\u2019s just like taking time. just takes time. My warmups are longer. I\u2019m trying to find tactics that work really well, finding resources that might be less than traditional. The Knees Over Toes guide, I\u2019m familiar with him. His stuff\u2019s great. I\u2019ve used a lot of his stuff. And there is a movement specialist out here in Boulder. name is Lawrence Van Lingen, who just like...\n\nJohn (36:14)\n\nThen Patrick.\n\nRich Ryan (36:23)\n\nThese practitioners who are talking a lot more about kind of how to move and like creating space so that you\u2019re moving properly and just like really buying into just like weird stuff honestly has been and like being open-minded instead of just like doing like this traditional physical therapy stuff or just like what you learned in like a NASM handbook like being able to look beyond just like knowing that I don\u2019t really know how to do any of this stuff but some people do.\n\nSo just trying to find answers and just being very open-minded around what could potentially work. Because I\u2019ve played around with a lot of weird stuff. And it all works to a certain degree. And then just having different tools in my tool belt because I am trying to continuously feel better.\n\nJohn (37:06)\n\nYeah, 100%. Yeah. And definitely that continuous experimentation, that\u2019s something I really respect from you as well, Rich. I think anybody who\u2019s listened to the RMR training podcast, we\u2019ve seen your journey and we\u2019ve seen just how much you\u2019ve changed and adapted over the last few years. So that\u2019s always really cool to see. One other side I want to touch on, it\u2019s this mindset side. So, you know, you\u2019ve talked about these 40 to 60 minute grindy workouts. We know that HiRox in itself is a grind. A lot of people don\u2019t want to go into that pain.\n\nAs soon as they get there, it\u2019s so uncomfortable that they want to stop. You\u2019re obviously somebody who can push through this. And so I\u2019m curious, what are your tips in terms of the mindset? Like how can you help someone to really enjoy or want to go into that hard space?\n\nRich Ryan (37:51)\n\nMmm. Yeah, that\u2019s tough one, right? Because the way I look at it and the way I can justify it to myself is that it\u2019s part of the process, right?\n\nLike I really enjoy being engaged in some kind of process and the process of improving for high rocks, like this is required. Like having to be there is required. And a lot of times when I\u2019m doing these workouts and say it is a linear progression, right? Say like last week I did 40 minutes, this week I\u2019m doing 45 minutes. As soon as I hit that 40 minute mark,\n\nthe discomfort is like exponential, right? It\u2019s like beyond where I\u2019ve gone before. But I know that\u2019s where I need to go. Like I know that\u2019s where we\u2019re gonna make our money here. Like this is where the improvement happens because this is where we haven\u2019t been, right? So like I like to engage in that process and knowing that there\u2019s like pieces that I have to, that I have to move around to really continue to improve. So that\u2019s how I really like to think of it. I like to be like process oriented.\n\nwhere if it\u2019s this big thing where I used to get into these moments and just try to mentally buckle down or think about what this means about me as a person if I can\u2019t do it, it\u2019s too weighty, it\u2019s too much. And it\u2019s like, am I a failure if I don\u2019t wanna sit here? It\u2019s like, nobody wants to sit here. Nobody wants to do this. This is uncomfortable. You want the byproduct, you want the results, and you want to be done and feel good about what you accomplished. So that\u2019s why you have to do it.\n\nJohn (38:56)\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nRich Ryan (39:11)\n\nLike you can\u2019t get that feeling of accomplishment. You can\u2019t get that byproduct of being better than you were before if you\u2019re not just willing to go there a little bit at a time. And it doesn\u2019t mean anything in the moment when you don\u2019t want to and if you want to quit, but knowing that you have to do it to get where you ultimately want to go is just something that I always am thinking about in these workouts.\n\nJohn (39:34)\n\nDo feel like this is something that you\u2019ve increased your tolerance for over time or has it been more difficult to get there? What is your sense?\n\nRich Ryan (39:44)\n\nYeah,\n\nit goes back to like the maturity as an athlete, right? Like in, when I was first really into all this stuff, endurance in general, like my goal was to win. Like if I didn\u2019t feel like I was winning, I didn\u2019t feel like I had value and I didn\u2019t feel like anything that I didn\u2019t want to do anything else. like it was actually a detractor. It\u2019s a very, it\u2019s a strong motivator when you\u2019re winning, but when you\u2019re not winning it\u2019s,\n\nJohn (39:55)\n\nYeah.\n\nRich Ryan (40:09)\n\nit\u2019s just incredibly distracting because it\u2019s not realistic. So then the why I\u2019m doing it has had to change. And then leaning into this process part and like, I actually just love doing this. I love having a project. I love being able to feel progress and feel like that I\u2019m bettering myself as I go. Then it just makes it easier.\n\nSo yeah, think as a maturity of as a, as an athlete going through this multiple times and just like really engaging with the process and an understanding that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing it makes it a lot easier. Where before I wasn\u2019t quite sure. Like I came in I was like, I\u2019m doing this cause I\u2019ve always been an athlete. Like this is something that I just do. And then like when the results didn\u2019t come the way that I wanted them to come, just, it got like harder. But now that I\u2019m like on the other side of it and I\u2019m like, no, I just like the process. I like this project.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t feel as hard. It feels more exciting.\n\nJohn (41:02)\n\nAmazing, Okay, let\u2019s let\u2019s pivot a little bit. So I want to talk about doubles as well. So you ran a 48 31. Is that still the world record time for doubles rich?\n\nRich Ryan (41:08)\n\nyeah, for sure.\n\nIt is, and it was a faster time than, so Pallion and I, had the open doubles record as well, and I think our time was like 48.38. We actually ran faster in pro. The open record since been broken twice. The Sutherlands broke it, and then later that weekend in Berlin, Fabi Eisenhower, I think, I think something, and our guy Jake Williamson took it down. And they\u2019re the first athletes under 48, I think, or 47 something.\n\nJohn (41:15)\n\nOkay.\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nOkay, okay. But as of now, you currently hold the men\u2019s pro doubles world record along with Palaio in Miami. So what do think you figured out about doubles? What do you think has enabled you to do so well in that event?\n\nRich Ryan (41:55)\n\nI mean, having a great partner is really nice. Having someone that matches my strengths almost to a T, the running really matters a lot. And if you can have a partner that you can trust that if they push, you can go with, and if you push, they can go with you, is really helpful. So it\u2019s a bit of a cheat code. And it goes back to the mid-distance. Having a little bit of break is really nice for me. That\u2019s how I would prefer it.\n\nWe talked about it a couple times now. It\u2019s like the grind is hard and I\u2019ve had to like really Take this process of like enjoying it, but I really enjoy the high end and the rest So it\u2019s like it just kind of fits the skill set a little bit more and that the running is a little bit more important It has is really helpful. So I mean our first time we ran doubles together. We set that open record So I don\u2019t necessarily know if we figured anything out other than just like\n\nimproving our own own fitness and like being able to kind of like refine a little bit\n\nJohn (42:52)\n\nOkay, yep. So making those incremental improvements and perhaps this is just the event that\u2019s really tailored towards you and play those strengths. It might just be the perfect event for your\n\nRich Ryan (43:00)\n\nYeah,\n\nit might be. it\u2019s gonna be fun to watch how the doubles evolves in terms of like strategy. Like you\u2019re starting to see that everybody kind of does everything the same way in the individual race, you know? Like people kind of all do the burpees the same. Like if you are not moving well in wall balls, like you\u2019re gonna be left behind. So people kind of look the same in wall balls. People kind of look the same on the sleds.\n\nAnd doubles, there\u2019s just a lot more nuance, a lot more transitions, a more strategy. So that\u2019s gonna be fun to see how that kinda comes along and see how things kinda change.\n\nJohn (43:32)\n\nOkay, okay. And so I also want to talk about just this overall picture about your life for rich. So you said that you don\u2019t consider yourself to be a full-time athlete right now. You have other responsibilities. You have a coaching business. You run a podcast. You create these YouTube videos as well. Are those other things your main responsibilities or do you have other major components outside of that as well?\n\nRich Ryan (43:56)\n\nSo yeah, the business, like how I make my living is by like working in, having my own little like fitness business. Um, so that\u2019s been able to sustain since 2000. went full time with an online fitness business in 2017 and I was working in the fitness business as like a trainer and like group fitness instructor, uh, starting in like 2014 or 2015. So yeah, that\u2019s, that\u2019s, that\u2019s number one.\n\nAnd I feel like I can justify that they are kind of the same. Like my training is good for the business and my performance is good for business and I feel like the more I\u2019m sitting and thinking about this type of stuff for the business side of things with the content, that directly relates to how well my training goes and how well I\u2019m racing. So it\u2019s kind of the same now.\n\nBut, and that\u2019s how I justify it anyway. it\u2019s like not full-time athlete, but kinda. It\u2019s like athlete, content creator, coach, kinda thing is kind of I guess where I\u2019m at.\n\nJohn (45:02)\n\nIt\u2019s yeah, it\u2019s a very unified life at this point. It feels like every single component is reinforcing each other and you\u2019ve kind of set yourself up for the long term as well. So yeah.\n\nRich Ryan (45:11)\n\nI hope. Yeah, yeah.\n\nThat\u2019s the plan. But yeah, that\u2019s, that is like, wouldn\u2019t have, my wife would call, would say that I\u2019m like a professional. She would tell people that and I\u2019d be like, no, I\u2019m not like, stop saying, stop saying that to people. But now like, I do feel like when I go to these races, it\u2019s my job for sure. Like when I\u2019m training, it\u2019s like, okay, yeah, this is like actually part of my job, which is awesome. Which was a kind of like the idea in the first place. I go, it to like be.\n\nJohn (45:26)\n\n100%.\n\nRich Ryan (45:35)\n\nan athlete more than anything else, just like who I was. I just like tried to build a business so I can do it. And yeah, it\u2019s kind of worked so far.\n\nJohn (45:41)\n\nOkay,\n\namazing, so obviously, Hirox has gone through this tremendous explosion. Just the number of people racing has grown tremendously. We\u2019ve also seen a lot more sponsors come into the picture as well. Has that changed the game for the pro athletes or the elite athletes in Hirox? How much has this growth really impacted you guys?\n\nRich Ryan (45:58)\n\nIt\u2019s definitely starting to, in years past, there would be deals for the top one or two people in either gender. And even those, don\u2019t think were necessarily enough to sustain 100 % a professional lifestyle in terms of an athlete. But now there\u2019s a little bit of something for everyone. And it does take the stress off of training, off of the workload, I suppose, people could put on. They could maybe do a little bit less or.\n\nor even think about going full-time. So it is absolutely going to change the game. I think this is gonna be the first year where we see most people in Elite 15, like the majority of Elite 15 not having like a full-time job. But I think right now, I don\u2019t know. that\u2019s most, lot of people are like me, like they are doing some coaching or they\u2019re like working at gym, they\u2019re gym owners. So they can\u2019t, they aren\u2019t sustaining 100%.\n\nJohn (46:41)\n\nYeah.\n\nRich Ryan (46:55)\n\noff of their athletic performance. But I think this is a year where we\u2019re going to see, you know, whatever, more than 15 people of the 30 kind of being able to live off of just like their racing.\n\nJohn (47:07)\n\nYeah, it definitely seems like a transitional season in that sense.\n\nRich Ryan (47:11)\n\nAnd that\u2019s gonna be, it\u2019s better, but it\u2019s also gonna be stressful for people, For racing, for their livelihood, that\u2019s hard. That\u2019s hard to do something like that, you know?\n\nJohn (47:22)\n\nThat is hard. is hard. Okay, Rich. So another one of the most interesting things of this last season was seeing Nick Bear enter the picture. And obviously you got to train very closely with Nick Bear. So tell us that story. So how did you come to work alongside Nick Bear for this season?\n\nRich Ryan (47:30)\n\nYeah.\n\nSo if anybody follows Nick Baer and his content, Right, right. So Nick Baer is a fitness entrepreneur. He started and is CEO of a wildly popular supplement company here in the United States called BPN Baer Performance Nutrition. But he\u2019s also what would be considered an influencer. He has a huge YouTube channel of\n\nJohn (47:44)\n\nmaybe first of all, like who is Nick Bear? Like maybe help set that scene for us as well.\n\nRich Ryan (48:08)\n\nbig Instagram and he\u2019s a very inspirational figure for a lot of athletes and he\u2019s kind of like the OG hybrid athlete where he was a big bodybuilder, huge jack guy and then just decided he wanted to take on new challenges and endurance is something that he\u2019s like really dove into. And then like as he, so he\u2019s like a massive dude, right? Like he\u2019s super jacked. He probably like weighs 200 or some pounds but he\u2019s just like yoked.\n\nAnd so like people see him and are very inspired by him because he is able to kind of put his passion and focus on a specific goal. And it like works out for him generally because of this work ethic that he has. So he\u2019s been doing these two things like super jacked. He ran like two or two thirty nine in a marathon, I think. And then like Hierox came out, it\u2019s kind of like this perfect blend of both things for him. Right. So he decided that he was going to start training for a Hierox. And he\u2019s also because he\u2019s an avid\n\nlearner and a podcast listener, he found arm our training podcast. So he\u2019d be like listening to the podcast as he was doing his like zone two stuff and just kind of like enjoy the content, reached out. was like, Hey, like what you guys are doing. we had him on the show. Then he was like, Hey, come down to like, I\u2019d to have you and Ryan come down to HQ and we\u2019ll do like his YouTube type of stuff and, being able to just kind of,\n\nlearned from each other. So it was really cool opportunity, right? Like he was getting into high rocks and we were happened to be like the domestic athletes that, he.\n\nlike, engaged with the content the most. And it was just like a good fit. So we just kind of went down there, hung out with them, threw down, and it was awesome.\n\nJohn (49:42)\n\nOkay, okay. And what did you learn about training from watching the way that Nick approaches things?\n\nRich Ryan (49:48)\n\nHe\u2019s so locked in with nutrition, it\u2019s crazy. There\u2019s just so much more that we can do with nutrition in terms of timing and being intentional. And he does it all. And I think he does it a lot because, well, he came from bodybuilding background. He\u2019s done some bodybuilding shows and power lifting. So he kind of knows how that all works. And he\u2019s applied a lot of that to endurance. And he\u2019s just super locked in. And the results that he gets physically,\n\nand like aesthetically and also performance wise, I think he\u2019s a huge byproduct of like how locked in he is on the nutrition side. So that was one thing that I was, cause I think I\u2019m pretty locked in, but like not compared to him. He was like really locked in. Yeah, for sure.\n\nJohn (50:30)\n\nDialed in.\n\nOkay. Yeah. And obviously, Nick has a tremendous presence on YouTube. But Rich, you\u2019ve also been growing your presence this year. You passed the 10K subscriber mark on YouTube. It seems like your content, it was already very good, but it seems like it has dialed up in terms of quality and in terms of just overall production over this past year. So what are some of the things that you\u2019ve really learned about creating content over this past year?\n\nRich Ryan (50:42)\n\nYep.\n\nYeah, that was also something that was really cool to see how they do things down at BPN where like it\u2019s a team. It\u2019s not like Nick\u2019s not like doesn\u2019t have his DJI pocket Osmo like doing stuff. He has like professional people following and like it\u2019s a whole thing. It\u2019s really planned out. So that was something that I was like, you know, like I can\u2019t do this all on my own. Like if I\u2019m going to, it\u2019s just not going to be good or it\u2019s going to be too much work. Right? Like it\u2019s not too much work to the point where it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t want to do work. It\u2019s just like,\n\nBut it\u2019s too much work for me to do a good enough job to like my standard, right? I don\u2019t wanna be a full-time video editor. I don\u2019t wanna learn all these things. I don\u2019t mind it, I like it a little bit. But I like the concepts and the thinking, I like the training, like how it\u2019s all gonna come together. But the nuts and bolts of it, I\u2019m not that good at it. So I needed to find help. I had to actually take time to invest in it.\n\nAnd is something that I\u2019ve done business-wise for the past year or so, is really just like, I can\u2019t do everything. can\u2019t, like I am the bottleneck and understanding that and trying to outsource and finding people that I work really well with and that we have like the same type of vision and who can make the things that I want in my brain to come to life. And just like collaborating with them has been huge. So like, yeah, I\u2019ve just like.\n\nhired people to help me with the production and the shooting and editing. And it more just like reinvesting back into that space and just understanding what can be done and it can\u2019t all be done by me.\n\nJohn (52:32)\n\nAmazing. Amazing. So yeah, so it\u2019s really taking that team approach. And how do you think about balancing the podcasts that you\u2019re doing? So obviously you have one of the biggest podcasts in the high rock space. You also know how one of the biggest YouTube channels as well, especially around the educational side. So how do you think about balancing those two areas that you have?\n\nRich Ryan (52:49)\n\nYeah, it\u2019s...\n\nThey\u2019re like the information although is Similar right like I can repurpose something I can have a concept yeah, say whatever it could be whatever a bunch of stuff we just talked about is stuff there\u2019s content that like I\u2019ve been able to kind of think and talk about and Say it\u2019s like okay. We\u2019re gonna do a threshold for high rocks right like I can just kind of dump all my thoughts out in this way that\u2019s like non-formal on a podcast and it\u2019s like it\u2019s just\n\nThe format is looser, right? It\u2019s conversational. It\u2019s just like we\u2019re hanging out. We\u2019re just talking about what\u2019s going on. But the YouTube is like very much storytelling driven, right? And we were talking a little bit before we even popped on, like being able to hook people in early. And like, I wanted it just be like, this is good content. I think this is stuff that people will learn. But if they don\u2019t watch the video, they won\u2019t get what I think is beneficial for their high-rex results.\n\nSo I gotta play the game, right? I gotta like try to figure out these thumbnails, try to figure out these titles, work the first 30 seconds and like make sure that they feel like the time that they\u2019re gonna spend clicking on this video is gonna be worth it. And like that\u2019s how you do, like the packaging and like the hook has been just like a completely different side of content creation. And think of it more of a storytelling. Where podcasts, just like, it is more...\n\nIt is more just informal. It\u2019s loose, right? Like people are along with you and they opt in. This is an hour long, right? They\u2019re like, I\u2019m in for this hour. Whatever. here. Like I\u2019m gonna, gonna, I trust that this is gonna be fine. YouTube is like, it\u2019s shorter and the attention span is shorter. So like locking people in has been a challenge. Like trying to figure out like the best route from a storytelling perspective is something I never had to do before. But the content is still the same content, but just like how it\u2019s packaged is just like so much different.\n\nJohn (54:45)\n\nInteresting, interesting. which video are you most proud of from the last year? So for those listening, if they wanted to check out one Rich Ryan video, which one would it be?\n\nRich Ryan (54:56)\n\nSo the video that seems to be doing the best is about the threshold training and what that means and how that concept works. And then also there\u2019s a secondary video under it that is how then to put it into practice. And those type of training concepts I feel like is where I excel the most. the viewership proves that. I really like the race recap ones. I think that those are fun. It\u2019s a little bit of behind the scenes and just like,\n\nbeing able to talk through the race strategy. Everything I do, I\u2019m gonna come at it with a lens of like, I want the viewer to come away with something that\u2019s gonna make them better at high rocks. I\u2019m not here to be like, I think I\u2019m awesome, so check out how awesome I am during my awesome content. As far as like, hey, here\u2019s some stuff that I learned in my last race in high rocks, so I feel like this could help you as well.\n\nSo I like the race recap ones. I thought the world\u2019s one was good. I like the doubles one. think doubles one was really good. Because then I started to get editors for that. Before that, not so good. But the ones where they have editors in the past three months are all way better.\n\nJohn (55:59)\n\nAmazing, Okay, Rich, final question. So you\u2019re a person who\u2019s constantly learning, you\u2019re always discovering new things. What is at the edge of your curiosity right now? What are you really curious about? What are you looking into? What has been capturing your attention recently?\n\nRich Ryan (56:17)\n\nYeah, really good question. Because it\u2019s off season, I like to have time to... This isn\u2019t a great off season. I gotta be ready for October. I\u2019m looking at 12 weeks right now for the first major. I would like to have a little bit more time. Two concepts that I\u2019ve been diving into are velocity-based training, VBT, which is basically how fast you\u2019re moving during your strength. I have a sensor, it\u2019s called output.\n\nThere\u2019s a different sensors that work and you can like strap it to your barbell, can strap it to your wrist, you can strap it to your foot and then it like kicks to an app and tells you how fast you\u2019re actually moving. So this is almost like heart rate training for strength, right? Because then you can kind of set a goal, like if you\u2019re safe for back squat, you\u2019re gonna want to move at 0.8 to one meter per second, right? And that\u2019s kind of in this velocity-based training like block, like bucket.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t hit that, say you\u2019re too fast, you put more weight on until you\u2019re in that zone. And if you\u2019re not fast enough, you take weight off. So it\u2019s a way to kind of undulate your training so that you\u2019re hitting the marker and you\u2019re not just like, all right, last week was 225, this week\u2019s 230, no matter how I feel or no matter what\u2019s gonna happen, right? So like, I\u2019m very interested in the velocity-based training. I\u2019ve been playing around with it and it\u2019s been making me feel like I\u2019m able to do these lifts and not...\n\nfeel like I\u2019m overdoing it and I\u2019m still hitting the target. So it\u2019s a more objective way for weight training, which has been an interesting shift because it\u2019s so objective because it\u2019s pounds and kilos. But having the speed part has been kind of cool. Another thing that I\u2019m just thinking about a lot is what\u2019s actually happening lactate-wise in all of the movements.\n\nWhat happens when you push the sled and like these, measurements are millimoles, right? And usually in these like in our threshold, if we\u2019re like sitting there and it\u2019s like a zone four, we want to be between two and four millimoles. But when you push a sled globally, how much more lactate is, is like presented? Is it very local or, do you go from like four to 10? And then what\u2019s that do to that run? And then when you do that run, does it stay elevated or does it drop down below? So I want to start playing around with some lactate testing.\n\ndone that but just like straight single modality like on a bike or run and I\u2019ll be able to tell me like what my heart rate is based off my lactate whatever I want to know exactly what I was doing in high rocks so I think I\u2019m gonna get one a meter and kind of play around with that and then see like how it works and so I can be like a little bit more dialed in to understand like what what\u2019s happening fatigue wise during the stations of high rocks\n\nJohn (58:55)\n\nYeah, that\u2019s fascinating. That was actually, so I recently spoke to Gommar from WAD science and that was one of the areas we talked about a lot. There actually are some studies now that are looking at both that lactate and VO2 in a high rock setting. And those are very new to come out and it\u2019s absolutely fascinating to look at. And the other thing you might consider getting is one of those portable VO2 masks, but that would be like going to like the next level. I don\u2019t know if you want to go there, Rich.\n\nRich Ryan (59:00)\n\nMm. Mm-hmm.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nWe could, I can\u2019t say never. There\u2019s gonna be something, right now I\u2019m gonna be like, nah, but in like a year I\u2019ll probably be like, yeah, I should probably get one of those things.\n\nJohn (59:20)\n\nYou can\u2019t say no.\n\nAmazing. Well, it\u2019s going to be super fascinating to track your progress this season. Highly recommend the RMR training podcast, highly recommend Rich\u2019s YouTube channel. Definitely if you\u2019re listening, go and check those out. But Rich Ryan, thanks so much for being part of the podcast.\n\nRich Ryan (59:38)\n\nYeah, thanks for having me. It super fun,\n\n",

A proven approach can be the difference between standing on the podium or leaving the\n{ts:8} race feeling disappointed. In this video, I'm going to talk to you about the things that I've done in the past\n{ts:13} that have moved the needle and things that I've tried that you need to completely avoid. My name is Rich Ryan.\n{ts:18} I am a threetime High Rocks Elite 15 World Championships qualifier with a pro PR of 5428. The first thing that you\n{ts:27} want to consider is how you're going to come into the wall balls in terms of sets and reps. So, is it better to do a\n{ts:34} bigger set or to come in and have smaller chunks that you're able to execute throughout the entire duration?\n{ts:40} I've gone back and forth between this and I've landed on if you have the ability to do a big set, then you should\n{ts:47} do the big set. But what exactly would be considered a big set? To me, it's 50 plus. If you can come in there and knock\n{ts:54} out half of the wall balls right away, you're setting yourself up for such an easier time in the long term. But if you\n{ts:61} don't have 50 wall balls, that's just not something that's in your ability. Then you should do smaller sets and\n{ts:66} reps. And having a plan during this portion so that you understand how many you can do while maintaining consistent.\n{ts:73} So that could pick any number. It really doesn't matter as long as you know that you can do it and you can rest for the\n{ts:80} same amount of time all the way through the entire set of wall balls. So it could be 25 reps, it could be 15 reps,\n{ts:87} it could be five reps, whatever it is, it's better to have that plan than to come in on race day and just hope to do\n{ts:94} a big set when you don't really have the ability level to do a big set yet. Not that you can't, but you don't have it\n{ts:102} right now. So, it's good to stay within your ability and count off the rest each time and stay consistent from zero to\n{ts:111} 100. The nature of the movement makes resting feel a bit demoralizing. But as long as you can\n{ts:118} stay disciplined and stay just under your threshold for your high-end ability on the wall balls, then you're going to\n{ts:124} be okay no matter what your plan is. As long as you understand where that threshold is and you stay disciplined\n{ts:130} when it comes to your rest. Generally, when we've been taught how to squat, there is a maneuver called the valava\n{ts:135} maneuver. That is a big deep breath in and pressing out into your ribs to create internal pressure and stability\n{ts:142} as you're squatting. Now, this is almost required for moving heavy loads. And because we take the squat pattern from\n{ts:150} moving heavy into something like wall balls, we we end up having the same type of breathing pattern where it's a\n{ts:156} breathe in, a squat, and then a breathe out at the top. So, one thing that I recommend that you do is play around\n{ts:163} with the breathing sequence to make sure that what you're doing is optimal and to not just like fall into these patterns\n{ts:169} because that's the way you think that they should be. So, really what I would recommend is completely flipping it.\n{ts:174} Something that's been very helpful for me is being able to breathe throughout the entire motion of the wall ball and\n{ts:180} not holding my breath and constricting my midsection. and it's going to just restrict blood flow and reduce the\n{ts:187} amount of CO2 that I'm able to expel and the amount of oxygen that I'm able to bring in. So, if you can breathe\n{ts:192} throughout the entire range of motion of this movement, it's going to make for a much better experience. So, next time\n{ts:198} try this. As you're releasing the ball, breathe out. So, and then as you catch the ball, breathe in. When you flip the\n{ts:206} breathing pattern, you'll actually see that you can breathe throughout the entire time. And when you breathe\n{ts:212} unloaded, you're just going to be able to get more oxygen in. And if you can exhale on your way down, you're just\n{ts:219} going to be in a better rhythm and it's just going to reduce the amount of stress that you start to feel\n{ts:225} emotionally and mentally because your ventilation rate isn't going to jump incredibly high right away. So being\n{ts:231} able to flip that breathing pattern and have it having it be much more natural and kind of easy is something you need\n{ts:239} to play around with in training if you want to make sure that what you're doing during the wall balls is actually\n{ts:244} optimal for you. It's natural when doing the wall balls to toss the ball up and just hold your arms up over your head\n{ts:250} and wait for the ball to come back to you. I would recommend not doing this and bringing your arms down or back so\n{ts:257} that you can improve the blood flow into these extremities and help with the lactic acid that is going to build up in\n{ts:264} your shoulders. If blood can't pump into those areas, we're going to have a harder time clearing that and that's\n{ts:270} when that feeling of the kind of shoulder burn ends up happening. So, as you're going through your wall balls, I\n{ts:275} do recommend throwing it and either dropping your arms down as low as they can, swinging your arms out and around\n{ts:281} to help improve that blood flow and to bring your arms down a little bit and to get back into a catch position, which is\n{ts:286} just underneath your chin. You don't need to catch the ball up over your head. You just need to catch the ball in\n{ts:291} the proper position. So, once you throw it, you can put your arms right back in that position or drop them quickly and\n{ts:297} get them back to underneath your chin and to help guide that ball directly where it needs to go. Now, often times\n{ts:303} when the women are competing, the target's a little bit lower, so the ball comes back a little bit faster. So,\n{ts:309} being able to drop your arms and then bring it bring it back up is a bit of a challenge. Something I've seen athletes\n{ts:313} do is bring your arms up and kind of drop them back this way so that you're not dropping them all the way down to\n{ts:318} your your hips that it just kind of comes down behind and then you can catch the ball back in that under chin\n{ts:325} position. Once you're proficient in the movement of wall balls, then you can start to work on how fast you're moving\n{ts:331} through them. When I first started doing wall balls in training, I didn't realize that there was a cadence element to wall\n{ts:338} balls. I just thought you just did them and everybody was kind of the same and it was a matter of who didn't break\n{ts:344} first. But really, the cadence in which you drop down and pop back up is going to make an incredible difference for how\n{ts:352} long you're under load and for how long you're it takes you to do the whole set. So working on a fast descent is very\n{ts:360} important when it comes to maximizing your ability to do wall balls. So I would recommend practicing dropping into\n{ts:367} the the squat position even before the ball gets there. At first there's going to be a strength and stability issue\n{ts:373} that you're going to have and a bit of a speed issue. But if your mobility is strong and your positional awareness is\n{ts:379} really good that you start to drop down, you can have the ability to go faster. Now, during the race, you might not want\n{ts:386} to do this because it's it's going to ramp up your cadence and and potentially make you more tired, but it's nice to\n{ts:392} have that and to create kind of gears for yourself. Being able to do speed work is just going to help your ability\n{ts:399} to go faster. So, working on your cadence in that squat is very helpful. Outside of the actual tactics, what I\n{ts:406} like to do is think about some sort of visualization that is going to help me move through the wall balls during the\n{ts:411} station. It's hard because there is no forward movement. Pretty much with every other station in Hierrox, we're able to\n{ts:420} either see the pace move forward while on the machines or there's actual movement that helps break up what's\n{ts:428} happening in a station so that we're not sitting there thinking about the number of reps. We're thinking about the amount\n{ts:433} of space that we're covering, which is just more helpful from a mental standpoint than sitting there and doing\n{ts:439} 100. when you really break things out, the amount of reps that you're doing on wall balls isn't that much different\n{ts:444} than the amount of reps that you're doing in any of the other stations that like we can really account for. So like\n{ts:449} the strokes on the on the ski, the strokes on the row, the amount of lunges that we're doing, they're all right\n{ts:454} around 100 or even more. So coming into wall balls, the number of 100 shouldn't really be that daunting, but there's no\n{ts:463} movement to help us break up the actual station. So, I like to visualize this movement, and you can do this in a many\n{ts:470} in many different ways, but the way I like to do it as a runner who spent hours and hours and hours doing laps on\n{ts:476} a track, I break down my progress like I'm running on a track. So, every 10 reps, I visualize myself completing 100\n{ts:483} meters. And every rep I do after that, I'm completing some 10 m, 20 m, 50 m on the track as I'm going through each rep.\n{ts:492} So, by the time I get to 60, it's like, oh, I just have 40 left, which is like 400 m. And I know that I can always do\n{ts:499} 400 meters on a track. I will never stop in my last 400 or my last 200. So having this mental reframe and visually\n{ts:507} watching myself cover distance is really helpful when it comes to breaking out the chunks of work needed to do on the\n{ts:517} wall balls. So for you, it doesn't necessarily have to be that if you're not that familiar with the track. It\n{ts:521} could be like lengths of carpet on the actual race course. could be whatever you want it to be. It could just be a\n{ts:528} meter moving. It could be anything that in your head signifies progress. So, I'd really recommend some kind of\n{ts:535} visualization to help you move that needle forward. And finally, this really is the most important part to your race\n{ts:545} success when it comes to wall balls. It's the pacing of the race itself. So, as a runner, I like to think of things\n{ts:553} in distance running terminology. And this is not that much different than any given distance running event. In a\n{ts:560} distance event, a kick is where you start to kind of go a little bit faster, go a little bit harder from a certain\n{ts:567} point until the finish. So, as we kick in an endurance event, it's usually going to be from 1 to two minutes out\n{ts:576} from the finish. That seems to be the amount that is doable to kind of hold and sustain. A monster kick is about\n{ts:583} five minutes out. So if we take the time domain and move that into high rocks, really we're not even kicking until we\n{ts:591} get to the wall balls. And from this perspective, we should have some juice coming into the wall balls. Too often\n{ts:599} athletes are just attacking the race from the start into the middle and at the end they're just hanging on or\n{ts:605} they're bleeding time. And this happens on the lunges and the wall balls. So you come into there and you're just hoping\n{ts:611} you can finish. There is no kick. There is no more energy and you do not get the result that you want. And this is why\n{ts:618} the variance is so wide. It's not that one person's ability to do wall balls is better than another person's ability to\n{ts:623} do wall balls. It's just that some people are just timing it better and are having more success with the duration of\n{ts:630} the race. So, I would recommend giving back two minutes on the course of your effort so you can come into wall balls\n{ts:636} and gain two and a half, right? And it's hard to do in the moment because you want to maximize that. But if it's all\n{ts:643} going to come back at the end, then it doesn't even matter what you did before. So, making sure that your pacing is on\n{ts:648} point so you can come into the wall balls with a little bit left is the best bet. So, these are my main tips when it\n{ts:654} comes to strategy for wall balls and high rocks. If you don't have a strategy, make one. Take some of these\n{ts:660} pieces. Make sure that you are doing everything in your ability not just to physically prepare, but to mentally\n{ts:665} prepare. Both of those aspects need to be accounted for if you want to come into this race and do the best that you\n{ts:671} possibly can. And if you're not wanting to do the best that you possibly can, I don't know why you're doing this in the\n{ts:676} first",

          "snippet": "### Chapter 1: Programming Principles: The Backbone of Froning's Success\n\nRich Froning's training isn't random; it's strategically structured around periodization, cycling intensity and volume to optimize results and prevent overtraining. His programs incorporate distinct phases, often featuring:\nBase Phase: This foundational phase focuses on building a strong base of general physical preparedness (GPP). It emphasizes foundational movements like squats, presses, deadlifts, and pull-ups at moderate intensities and volumes. The goal is to establish a solid foundation of strength and endurance before progressing to more specialized training. Think high reps, moderate weight, and a focus on technique refinement.\n\n\u2026\n\nPower Phase: This phase incorporates plyometrics, Olympic lifts (like cleans and snatches), and high-intensity movements designed to increase power output. The focus shifts from simply lifting heavy weights to explosively moving weight. This phase builds the capacity for rapid force production, crucial for CrossFit's dynamic movements.\n\nCompetition/Peaking Phase: This phase meticulously tapers the training volume while maintaining intensity. The goal is to peak physically and mentally for competitions or major fitness goals. This phase often incorporates specific workouts simulating the demands of the competition or target event. This phase requires careful monitoring to avoid overtraining or injury.\nThis cyclical approach prevents plateaus and ensures the body is adequately prepared for the demands of each training phase. The constant variation prevents adaptation and fosters continuous improvement.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Chapter 3: Metabolic Conditioning: Building Unrivaled Endurance\n\nFroning's conditioning isn't just about running; it's about building a highly efficient cardiovascular system and exceptional work capacity. His program uses various high-intensity interval training (HIIT) methods:\n\nAMRAP (As Many Rounds/Reps As Possible): This time-based format pushes athletes to complete as many rounds or repetitions of a given workout as possible within a set timeframe. This maximizes caloric expenditure and cardiovascular stress.\nEMOM (Every Minute On the Minute): This involves completing a set number of repetitions of an exercise within each minute, resting the remainder of the minute. This is excellent for building both strength and endurance simultaneously.\n\nFor Time: These workouts are designed to be completed as quickly as possible, maximizing both strength and conditioning simultaneously. The focus is on speed and efficiency.\n\nInterval Training: Alternating high-intensity bursts with periods of active or passive recovery. This method improves both aerobic and anaerobic capacity.\n\nThe intensity of these workouts is high, but the programming is carefully designed to prevent overtraining and allow for adequate recovery.",

In one documentary I watched about him, when asked how he does his programming he replied \u201cby the seat of my pants\u201d. It\u2019s the embodiment of listening to your body.\n\nDaily workouts are adjusted depending on how he feels on a given day. This almost casual approach to programming means stress levels are kept lower as he won\u2019t ever feel as though he didn\u2019t do what he\n\n\u2026\n\n## Clear Workout Focus\n\nRich Froning trains multiple times per day (3-6 daily workouts), and each one has a clear focus. He doesn\u2019t seem to \u2018mix modalities\u2019 within a workout, for example he keeps his strength workouts and his conditioning workouts separate.\n\nContrast this with a typical gym goer, who may spend 20 minutes on a bike or treadmill and then try to lift weights. Would they be lifting as well as they possibly could having already done 20 minutes work? I doubt it. That means the potential improvements in stamina and strength have both been blunted.",
