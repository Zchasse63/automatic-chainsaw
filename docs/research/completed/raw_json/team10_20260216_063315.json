          "snippet": "### The Format:\n\n**Running:**\n\n- Both athletes run ALL 8 x 1km runs\n\n- You run 8km total (same as Singles)\n\n- You MUST run together as a team (this is a rule)\n\n**Stations:**\n\n- ONE athlete works while the other rests\n\n- You complete the SAME total volume as Singles (split between you)\n\n- You decide how to divide the work at each station\n\n\u2026\n\n### 4. Different Challenge\n\nSome athletes prefer the team dynamic and strategic complexity of Doubles over the pure individual grind of Singles. It's not easier or harder\u2014it's different.\n\n### 5. Entry Point\n\nFor athletes not quite ready for full Singles volume, Doubles offers a way to experience HYROX competition while splitting station work. You still run 8km, but station recovery is built in.\n\n## Singles vs Doubles: What Actually Changes?\n\nUnderstanding these differences is critical for strategy.\n\n### Running Demands\n\n**Singles:** You run 8km, resting during stations\n\n**Doubles:** You ALSO run 8km, but your partner is working stations during your run\n\n**Implication:** Running fitness matters just as much (maybe more) in Doubles. You can't hide a weak run.\n\n### Station Recovery\n\n**Singles:** Brief rest between runs and stations\n\n**Doubles:** Extended rest during partner's station work (30s-3min depending on station)\n\n**Implication:** You can go harder on your station work because you get built-in recovery.\n\n### Energy Management\n\n**Singles:** Pace conservatively to finish all 8 stations\n\n**Doubles:** Can push harder on your assigned station work since you rest while partner works\n\n**Implication:** Strategic aggression pays off more in Doubles than Singles.\n\n\u2026\n\n- Partner A: Stronger on power stations (Sleds, Wall Balls, Farmers)\n\n- Partner B: Better engine (SkiErg, Row, Burpees, Running)\n\n- Requires careful station division strategy\n\n**Advantage:** Higher ceiling if executed well. Each athlete plays to strengths.\n\n**Option C: Power/Bodyweight Split**\n\n\u2026\n\n### Strategy 1: Even Split (50/50)\n\n**How it works:** Divide every station exactly in half.\n\n- SkiErg: 500m each\n\n- Sled Push: 25m each\n\n- Rowing: 500m each\n\n- Wall Balls: 50 reps each\n\n**Pros:**\n- Simple to execute\n\n- Fair workload distribution\n\n- Easy to pace\n\n- Minimal mid-race decisions\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Doesn't capitalize on individual strengths\n\n- More transitions = more time lost (5-10 seconds per switch)\n\n- Requires both athletes to be competent at everything\n\n**Best for:** Evenly matched teams, first-time Doubles, or when consistency matters more than speed.\n\n**Pro Tip:** The athlete finishing their portion should immediately prep for partner (adjust erg height, move equipment, etc.).\n\n### Strategy 2: Strength-Based Division\n\n**How it works:** Each partner \"owns\" their best stations and does significantly more volume there.\n\n**Example Division:**\n\n- Partner A (stronger): 100% Sled Push, 100% Sled Pull, 70% Wall Balls, 60% Farmers\n\n- Partner B (better engine): 100% SkiErg, 100% Row, 70% Burpees, 40% Farmers, 30% Wall Balls\n**Pros:**\n\n- Maximizes team efficiency\n\n- Each athlete plays to strengths\n\n- Faster potential finish time\n\n- Less time standing around\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Requires deep knowledge of each partner's abilities\n\n- Risk of one partner hitting complete failure\n\n- Harder to pace\n\n- Communication critical\n\n**Best for:** Experienced teams with clear, complementary strength/weakness profiles.\n\n**Warning:** If the \"strong\" partner gasses out on their assigned stations while the \"cardio\" partner is fresh, you've lost your advantage. This strategy has high ceiling but high risk.\n\n\u2026\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Balances total effort across all stations\n\n- Prevents any one athlete from completely emptying the tank\n\n- More flexibility than 50/50 but less chaos than alternating\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Requires trial and error in training to find right percentages\n\n- Hard to adjust mid-race\n\n- Need to track distances/reps carefully\n\n**Best for:** Teams with moderate fitness differences looking to equalize total workload across the race.\n\n\u2026\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Zero transition time at most stations\n\n- Maximum efficiency\n\n- Each athlete \"owns\" their domain\n\n- Very fast when executed perfectly\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Extremely high risk of failure\n\n- No backup plan if one athlete struggles\n\n- Requires elite fitness and mental toughness\n\n- Not adjustable mid-race\n\n**Best for:** Elite Pro Doubles teams with extensive race experience together. **We don't recommend this for 95% of teams.**\n\n## What We're Seeing in Competition\n\nBased on observation of Doubles teams at races, here's how competitive teams approach station division:\n\n### The Even Split Paradox\n\n**50/50 with one switch (traditional approach):**\n\n- Minimizes transition time (only 1 switch per station)\n\n- BUT typically results in slower overall pace\n\n- Each athlete working longer intervals = more lactic acid buildup = pace drops\n\n**Why this is slower:** When you work a long interval without switching, intensity drops to manage fatigue. You're forced to go slower to complete your full portion.\n\n\u2026\n\n**SkiErg:**Alternate every 100-200m (3-5 switches total) **Sled Push:**Switch every 12.5m or even 6.75m (very frequent - 4-8 switches) **Sled Pull:**Switch every 12.5m or 6.75m\n\n\u2026\n\n**Why This Works:**\n\n- Maintains much higher intensity throughout the station\n\n- Short work intervals = less lactic acid accumulation\n\n- Partner gets brief recovery while other works\n\n- Can push near-maximal effort for short bursts\n\n- Overall station time is faster despite more transitions\n\n**The trade-off:** Requires excellent communication and smooth transitions, but the intensity benefit far outweighs the small transition time cost for most competitive teams.\n\n\u2026\n\n### The 4-Station Rule\n\n**Stations 1-4:** Attack at 85-90% effort. Build confidence. Establish momentum.\n\n**Stations 5-6:** Maintain 80-85%. This is the danger zone\u2014don't implode, but don't coast.\n\n**Stations 7-8:** Empty the tank. Give everything left. Nothing to save for.\n\n**Running:** Just because your partner is working doesn't mean you jog your run. Maintain steady pace at 75-80% effort. Your rest comes during their station work, not during your run.\n\n\u2026\n\n**30 Minutes Before:**\n\n- Light mobility only\n\n- Visualize first three stations\n\n- Check equipment locations together\n\n- Mental preparation: positive self-talk\n\n**At the Start Line:**\n\n- You'll run all laps together as a team (required by rules)\n\n- Agree on target run pace beforehand\n\n- Quick fist bump: \"Trust the plan. Support each other. Let's execute.\"\n\n\u2026\n\n**Station 5: Rowing (1000m total)** **Goal:**Use legs, not just arms. Hold split pace. **Division:**600/400 or 500/500 based on rowing ability **Technique:**Legs-back-arms on drive, arms-back-legs on recovery **Recovery:**Partner 1 actively breathes during partner 2's row **Common Mistake:**All arms, no legs. Split pace falls apart.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Communication Protocol\n\n**Before Each Station:**\n\n- Quick reminder of division plan\n\n- \"I'm taking first 500m\" or \"You're doing 30m\"\n\n- No long discussions\u2014you decided this in training\n\n**During Station:**\n\n- Encouragement only: \"Good pace!\" \"Strong!\" \"Almost there!\"\n\n- Zero negative comments\n\n- Don't coach technique mid-race (too late)\n**Between Stations:**\n\n- \"You good?\" (quick status check)\n\n- Adjust next station if needed: \"I'm gassed, you take more\"\n\n- Hype each other up: \"We're on pace!\" \"Crushing it!\"\n\n**Final 2 Stations:**\n\n- \"Leave it all out there!\"\n\n- \"Everything we've got!\"\n\n- Maximum encouragement and support\n\n\u2026\n\n### Together Training (1-2 days/week):\n\n- Station transition practice\n\n- Communication drills\n\n- Race pace simulation\n\n- Strategy testing and refinement\n\n- Mental preparation and team building\n\n### Monthly Benchmark (Critical):\n\nOnce per month, do a race simulation together:\n\n**Full Sim (Weeks 6, 10):**All 8 stations + 8km running each **Half Sim (Weeks 3, 7):**4 stations + 4km running each\n\nTrack total time, identify bottlenecks, adjust strategy, test different station splits.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Doubles vs Singles: Which Should You Choose?\n\nStill not sure if Doubles is right for you? Here's a decision framework:\n\n### Choose HYROX Doubles If:\n\n\u2705 You want the social/team aspect of racing with a partner\n\n\u2705 You have a compatible training partner (similar fitness, aligned schedules)\n\n\u2705 You enjoy strategic planning and teamwork dynamics\n\n\u2705 You want built-in station recovery (rest while partner works)\n\n\u2705 You're introducing someone to HYROX\n\n\u2705 You prefer accountability and shared goals\n\n\u2026\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Q: Do we both run all 8km, or do we split the running?**\n\nA: Both athletes run the FULL 8km (8 x 1km runs each). You do NOT split the running. The advantage in Doubles is that ONE person works at stations while the other rests, but running volume is the same as Singles.\n\n\u2026\n\n**Q: Do we have to run together during the race?**\n\nA: Yes, you MUST run all laps together as a team. This is a rule in HYROX Doubles. You need to agree on a sustainable pace that works for both partners. This is why running compatibility is so important when choosing a partner.",

In solo events, the individual must do everything themselves.\n\nIn a doubles format, the team divides the workload based on strategy, strength, and personal preferences. It allows a partner to take a break while the other completes a functional exercise. There is no rule governing how to split the workload, but each partner must perform a fair share of work. In some cases, they can split each station between them, such as switching every 15 reps on Wall Balls.",

          "snippet": "A HYROX Relay (aka: HYROX Team Relay) is a great way to experience a race with 3 of your friends, and share both the running & station work. In a HYROX Relay, you build a team of 4 members, and each athlete is responsible for 2 runs and 2 stations. Each athlete ends up completing about 2.2km of running and 25% of the station work.\n\n\u2026\n\n## HYROX Relay Format\n\nSo how does a HYROX Relay work? The running & stations are the same as all HYROX races, but you build a team of 4, and each athlete is responsible for 2 runs & 2 stations, or 25% of the overall work.\n- The full race consists of the same 8.7km of running & same 8 stations as all HYROX races\n\n- Each athlete runs about 2.2km in total, split up into two 1.1km sections\n\n- Your team decides which 2 stations each athlete completes\n\n- Each athlete must complete the run immediately preceding their assigned station\n\n- Each athlete is on their own during their run + station\n\n- Non-working team members wait in a transition zone, where they are tagged in by their teammate after he/she finishes their station\n\n\u2026\n\n- Teammate A will then run until they reach the Relay Transition Zone\n\n- At this point, Teammate A will tag Teammate B\n\n- Teammate B starts their 1km run\n\n- Teammate B will enter the Roxzone, and run to the start of the sled push\n\n\u2026\n\n## Rules\n\nThe rulebook for a HYROX Relay is a little different from that of a HYROX Doubles or solo race. The movement standards are the same, but there are some extra things to keep in mind.\n\n- Your team must complete the runs and stations in the designated order\n\n- Each team member must complete a run, immediately followed by the next station\n\n- Each team member must complete 2 runs & 2 stations\n\n- A team member may complete both runs & stations consecutively, or they can tag a different team member and come back to complete a run+station at a later time\n\n\u2026\n\n**IMPORTANT:**If a team member is doing 2 runs & stations back-to-back, they must run through the transition zone between each leg.\n\nThe relay transition will go like this:\n\n- Team Member 1 is almost finished with their station work\n\n- Team Member 2 is now allowed to enter the transition zone\n\n- Team Member 1 finishes their station work and runs into the transition zone\n\n- Upon entering the transition zone, Team Member 1 taps Team Member 2 on the shoulder\n\n- Team Member 2 takes off on their run, and Team Member 1 promptly exists the transition zone\n\n\u2026\n\n### Can a Mixed HYROX Relay team be comprised on 3 men & 1 woman, or 3 women & 1 man?\n\nNo. All HYROX Mixed Relay teams must be made up of 2 men and 2 women.\n\n### HYROX Mixed Relay\n\nAll HYROX Mixed Relay teams are made up of 2 men & 2 women.\n\nIn the Mixed Relay, all men use the men\u2019s weights and women use the women\u2019s weights. The same goes for wall ball target height.",

CONCEPT\nHYROX, an indoor mass participation fitness competition, is based on an idea by co-founder \nChristian Toetzke and involves a combination of running and functional movements. The race \nwas designed by Mintra Tilly, who also wrote the rulebook.\nHYROX consists of a 1 km run followed by one workout, repeated 8 times. In order to complete \nthe entire HYROX race and receive a valid finishing time, the racers must complete the runs \nand s in the specific order (run, run, etc.) until they have completed a total of 8 km running \nand 8 workouts. \nWhilst the repetition range and/or weights differ between the divisions, the running distance \nremains the same across all divisions: each participant must run 1 km before each workout, \ni.e. a total distance of 8 km.\nThe results and ranking system are based on the fastest time in each respective division. \nResults are sorted from the fastest to the slowest time. In addition to the overall fastest men\u2019s \nand women\u2019s times, results are also ranked in age groups (see below), also sorted from the \nfastest to the slowest time.\n\nRULEBOOK DOUBLES_\nHYROX EN Doubles Rulebook R1 Season 2025/26\n5\n2.CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION\n2.1 Conditions of participation in HYROX\nHYROX is a race open to everyone, qualifications are not required. \nBy participating in HYROX you are agreeing to the following conditions, which include the \nexclusion of liability and the terms of the Privacy Policy which can be read at  \n \n \nhttps://hyrox.com/terms-and-conditions/.\n2.2 Preconditions for participation\n \u2022\nIn order to participate in a HYROX event, \nracers must be at least 16 years old on \nthe day of race.\n \u2022\nOfficial rankings will be based on racers\u2019 \nbiological gender at birth.

DIVISIONS AND RANKING SYSTEM\n4.1 HYROX Divisions\n(a) WOMEN\n(b) MEN\n(c) MIXED\n(d) WOMEN PRO\n(c) MEN PRO\nHYROX offers five divisions. The divisions differ in gender, repetition and/or weight. The \nrunning distance remains the same across all divisions: everyone must run 1 km between each \nfor a total distance of 8 km. Racers start in waves based on their division. The start always takes \nplace exclusively with racers of the same division.\n \n4.2 HYROX age groups (excluding PRO Divisions*)\na) Under 24 (16 - 24) \nb) 25 - 29 \nc) 30 - 34 \nd) 35 - 39 \ne) 40 - 44 \nf) 45 - 49 \ng) 50 - 54 \nh) 55 - 59 \ni) 60 - 64 \nj) 65 - 69\nk) 70 - 74* \nl) 75 - 79*\nm) 80 - 84*\nn) 85 - 89*\n*Pro Divisions end at Age Group (h) 70-74\n\nRULEBOOK DOUBLES_\nHYROX EN Doubles Rulebook R1 Season 2025/26\n9\nAge groupers aged 70+ are not eligible to race in the Pro divisions and will not receive an \nofficial ranking, flag, or a World Championship slot.\nAge groups are determined by the racer\u2019s age at the date of the event. In addition, the age \ngroups are classified based on the average age of the two DOUBLES racers at the time of the \nevent. E.g. Doubles Team Member 1 is 24 years old and Doubles Team Member 2 is 38, the \naverage age is 31, hence they will be classified into age group (e).  \n4.3 Ranking System\nThe ranking system and the resulting overall ranking is based on the fastest time in the \nrespective division of each event. Results are sorted from the fastest to the slowest times. In \naddition, there is a ranking within the age groups, also sorted from the fastest to the slowest \ntimes.\nIf a racer competes twice within the same division, only their fastest time will be considered \nfor ranking purposes, and they are not eligible to podium more than once in that division for \nthe same race.\nThe results will be published immediately after each event ends, and will be available at \nresults.hyrox.com. \nAny incomplete running laps or deviation from the prescribed repetition range or movement \nstandards will result in a penalty (see Penalties) and/or disqualification. Penalties may be \nadded or amendments made for up to 48 hours after each event ends.\n\nRULEBOOK DOUBLES_\nHYROX EN Doubles Rulebook R1 Season 2025/26\n10\n5.

Any HYROX racer \nstarting at a regular HYROX event can qualify for the annual HYROX WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS \n(hereafter referred to as WORLDS). \nThe qualification slots are limited to a specific number for each division at an event. The number \nof qualification slots per division will be announced on the event page of each event city. \nIf a racer is placed within their age group and earns a designated slot, they will be notified via \nemail shortly after the event.\nThe racer will receive an official email with an invitation to register for the WORLDS within a \nstated time frame, otherwise their slot will roll down to the next best placed finisher in that \nsame division. The successful racer will participate at the WORLDS in the age group that they \nqualified in, regardless of their birthday.\n5.2 Qualification as an Individual Starter\nAll racers who have qualified in the age groups (a) - (j) as an individual/single (HYROX MEN / \nHYROX WOMEN / HYROX MEN PRO / HYROX WOMEN PRO) have to complete the distances, \nreps and weights of the PRO division at the championships.

Only results from the Doubles Pro Division are \neligible for consideration.\nPlease note: the qualifying pair must remain unchanged - substitutions are not permitted for \nElite 15 Doubles qualification.\nThis 365-day window is a rolling period, meaning it updates daily. At midnight (GMT) on each \nnew day, the earliest day in the previous 365-day period \u2018expires\u2019 and any new results from \nthat day become eligible for consideration. \nThis is a dynamic ranking that will be updated with each race to always reflect the past 365 \ndays from that particular date. Times achieved in Major races and WORLDS will be included \nin this ranking.\n\nRULEBOOK DOUBLES_\nHYROX EN Doubles Rulebook R1 Season 2025/26\n15\n7.1.3 Qualification via Major races \nThe winning Doubles Team of each Major earns an auto qualification slot for the remaining \nMajors of the current as well as the upcoming season - no roll downs.\nPodium place 1, 2 and 3 of each Major event directly qualify the racers for the Doubles Elite \n15 race at WORLDS - if these racers have already qualified, the slot will roll down to the next \n3 pairs of racers in line, so that at every Major, 3 female pairs and 3 male pairs of racers will \nqualify for the DOUBLES ELITE 15 race at WORLDS. If a pair of racers finishes in the Top 3 but \nwas already automatically qualified, the slot will roll down to the next pair of racers of that \nrespective major.\n7.2 Qualification via Regional Championship Races\nOnly individuals who are citizens or legal permanent residents of a designated country within \neach region are eligible to race. This excludes temporary visa holders such as tourists, students, \nor other non-resident classifications (commonly referred to as legal aliens). \nProof of eligibility must be provided through an original government-issued ID - such as a \npassport or permanent residency card. Driver\u2019s licenses or photocopies of any documents will \nnot be accepted.\nRacers who hold dual or multiple citizenships are only eligible to qualify in one Regional \nChampionship; if they race in more than one Regional Championship, only the time from their \nfirst race will be considered for qualification purposes.\nThe pairs of racers who achieve Podium place 1 of each Regional Championship becomes \ndirectly qualified for the Double Elite 15 race at WORLDS - if these racers have already qualified, \nthe slot will roll down to the next racers in line, so that at every Regional Championship, 1 pair \nof female and 1 pair of male racers will qualify for the Double ELITE 15 race at WORLDS. \n7.3 The HYROX World Elite 15 Doubles Championships\nThe only way to qualify for the WORLDS is by placing at a Major Championship or REGIONALS. \nThere is no direct qualification to the WORLDS based on a finishing time in a regular season \nrace.\n\nRULEBOOK DOUBLES_\nHYROX EN Doubles Rulebook R1 Season 2025/26\n16\n8. THE RACE\n8.1 HYROX DOUBLES Race\nHYROX DOUBLES is a two-person team format. \nTeams may consist of:\n \u2022\nTwo male racers (Opens \nMen\u2019s Doubles / Pro \nMen\u2019s Doubles)\n \u2022\nTwo female racers \n(Women\u2019s Doubles / Pro \nWomen\u2019s Doubles)\n \u2022\nOne male and one \nfemale racer (Mixed \nDoubles)\nA HYROX race consists of a 1km run followed by one workout, repeated 8 times.\nIn order to complete the entire HYROX race and receive a valid finishing time, the racers must \nstart at the designated start time, complete the runs and workouts in the designated order \n(Run 1, workout station 1, Run 2, workout station 2, etc.) until they have completed a total of \n8 km running and 8 workout stations whilst wearing their issued timing chip on an ankle at all \ntimes.\nA HYROX race operates using wave starts at regular scheduled intervals (e.g., every 10 \nminutes). Each racer is assigned an official start time, which is communicated prior to race day \nand confirmed again at check-in.\nRacers must have their official start time clearly visible on their arm.\nNote 1: Any racer who starts in an earlier or later wave than their official assigned start time \nwithout prior approval from the Race Organisers will be Disqualified (DQ).\n\nNote 2: It is the racer\u2019s responsibility to wear their timing chip on an ankle at all times while \nracing. Failure to do so will result in a \u2018Did Not Start\u2019 (DNS) leaderboard result.\nNote 3: Racers must avoid entering the Roxzone or run course before their official start time, \nas doing so may trigger their timing chip and result in an incorrect race time. \n8.2 Station Rules and Regulations\nFor Doubles, the 8 runs and workout stations must be completed together.\nIt is up to each Doubles Team member (DTM) to determine how far in distance or how many \nreps they complete. Hyrox Doubles workstations follow the principle of \u2018You Go/I Go\u2019 (YGIG) \nwhich means whilst one DTM works, the other DTM rests and vice versa.\n\nRULEBOOK DOUBLES_\nHYROX EN Doubles Rulebook R1 Season 2025/26\n17\nYGIG Example 1,000 meter Row: \nDTM 1 starts rowing whilst DTM 2 waits\nAfter a self selected distance (for example 250 meters) DTM 1 switches with DTM 2. \n\nDTM 2 continues to Row whilst DTM 1 rests\n\nThis process is repeated until the entire distance of 1,000 meters is covered \n \u2022\nComplete all workout stations in the \ncorrect order.\n \u2022\nEnter and Exit each workout station via \nthe correct routes. \n \u00bb\nExiting a workout station via the \nworkout station \u2018IN\u2019 arch will result in \na 2 minute time penalty.\n \u2022\nComplete the prescribed number of \nrepetitions and/or distances.\n \u2022\nPerform each exercise according to the \nmovement standards.\n \u2022\nPerform the exercises/movements using \nthe correct weight(s).\n \u2022\nOnly use a piece of equipment/lane/wall \nball station assigned by a member of \nthe Race Crew. Failure to do so will incur \na 2-minute penalty per infringement.\n \u2022\nOnly event-provided chalk may be used, \nand only at the workout stations where it is \nprovided. Chalk is not to be taken to any \nother workout stations or used at different \nworkout stations. Doing so will incur a \n2-minute penalty per infringement.\n \u2022\nTo avoid creating slip hazards for other \nracers and staff, the fluids provided at \naid stations are for drinking only. They \nare not to be used for active cooling \n(e.g. pouring water over the head or \nbody). Doing so will incur a 2-minute \npenalty per infringement.\n8.2 Running\nAll HYROX courses comprise the same distances and combine the Run Course, Roxzone and \nworkout station distances.\n\nBoth Doubles Team Members (DTMs) must run together for the entire 1,000m between each \nworkout station. If one team member runs ahead, a 1-minute penalty will apply, as this changes \nthe dynamic of a Doubles race. \nImportant 1: After the run, both team members must enter the workout station together. The \nworkout cannot begin until both are present. The station can only be exited once all reps or \ndistance are completed, and both team members must leave together.\n\nImportant 2: If a Doubles Team accrues more than 3 penalties for not staying together, they \nwill be deemed Out Of Competition and will not receive a ranking.\n\nRULEBOOK DOUBLES_\nHYROX EN Doubles Rulebook R1 Season 2025/26\n18\nThe running splits are always around 1,000 meters; depending on the venue, this may be split \nbetween 1-5 running laps. \nIn some cases, the first/last running lap may be less than 1,000 meters due to the location of \nthe start tunnel. In these cases, these missing meters will be balanced out during the last lap.\nOn the run course, there is a line dividing the running course into two zones: Fast Lane (smaller, \non the inside line) and Running Lane (larger, on the outside line). Racers running at a 4/km \npace or faster are required to use the Fast Lane, while other racers should stay in the Running \nLane. In the event that HYROX crew are directing the Fast Lane, all racers must comply with \ntheir instructions.\n8.3 Judging Teams\nA Judging Team will be responsible for ensuring all racers complete the race/each workout \nstation in the correct and safe manner. The Judges do this in coordination with the Head \nJudge of the respective station. \nThe Head Judge of each station is managed by the Race Directors, who oversee all sporting \naspects of the race and make the final decisions on all judging matters. \nAll decisions of the Lead Race Director are final.\n\nRULEBOOK DOUBLES_\nHYROX EN Doubles Rulebook R1 Season 2025/26\n19\n9. MOVEMENT STANDARDS, DISTANCES AND WEIGHTS\nIt is the responsibility of each pair of racers to complete all run segments and workout stations \nas prescribed, in the correct sequence, and to clearly demonstrate that all required movement \nstandards are being met throughout the race.\nAny execution of a run or movement that deviates from the prescribed standards, appears \nunusual or uncommon, or appears to provide a competitive advantage will not be recognised. \nSuch actions may result in either a no rep or a time penalty, depending on the station.\nAdditionally, equipment and lane assignments for each station will be determined by the \nHead Judge and their team. Racers are not permitted to choose their own equipment or lane \nunder any circumstances.\n9.1 SkiErg\nDistance 1,000 meters.\n \u2022\nPrior to starting, the monitor will be (re)\nset by a Judge.\n \u2022\nThe racer must have both feet on the \nSkiErg platform at all times during the \nexercise.

It must remain on both \nshoulders at all times throughout the \nstation, including in the turn zones. \n \u2022\nThe racer starts by standing tall with \nboth feet behind the line before \nbeginning their first lunge across the \nstart line.\n \u2022\nDuring each lunge, the trailing knee \nmust clearly touch the ground.\n \u2022\nEach repetition ends with the racer \nstanding tall, knees and hips fully \nextended.\n \u2022\nLunges must be alternating i.e. \nalternating knees touching the ground.\n \u2022\nThe racer can either lunge continuously \nor stop between each lunge with both \nfeet parallel on the ground.\n \u2022\nIt is not permitted to take any steps or \nshuffles between repetitions.\n \u2022\nIt is required that the racer\u2019s front foot \nmust completely cross the white line at \nthe end of each lane, and the finish line. \n \u2022\nThe racer does not have to lunge \naround the turning points at the end of \neach lane. However, they are required to \nrestart each working section by lunging \nacross the white line.\n \u2022\nDuring each sandbag transition \nbetween the DTM\u2019s, the sandbag must \nnot be passed forward. Sideways or \nbackwards is permitted, never forwards.\n \u2022\nThe resting DTM must walk behind \nthe working DTM at all times. It is not \npermitted to obstruct other racers \ne.g. walking alongside the working \nDTM. Doing so will be treated as an \ninfringement. \n \u2022\nThe station is complete once the racer\u2019s \nleading foot completely crosses the \nfinish line. They must then return the \nsandbag to the correct marked area.\nFig: 010\n\nRULEBOOK DOUBLES_\nHYROX EN Doubles Rulebook R1 Season 2025/26\n27\nSandbag Lunge Penalty Protocol\n \u2022\nIf the racer fails to return their sandbag \nto the correct area, a 30-second penalty \nshall apply. If a racer returns to correct \ntheir infringement before exiting the \nRoxzone, this penalty will not be applied. \n \u2022\nIf a racer completes all/part of the \nSandbag Lunge using the incorrect \nweight, they are required to repeat the \nentire workout station using the correct \nweight. Failure to do so will result in \nDisqualification (DQ). \n \u2022\nThe sandbag must remain on both \nshoulders at all times and the racer is \nnot permitted to put the sandbag down \nat any time during the workout station, \nincluding the turn zones.\nRemoving the sandbag from the shoulders will result in a 15-second penalty i.e. no warning. \nA second infringement will result in disqualification.\nDISTANCE \n100m\nWOMEN \n10 kg (white marking)\nWOMEN PRO / MEN\n20 kg (grey marking)\nMEN PRO \n30 kg (black marking)\n9.8 Wall Balls\n \u2022\nIt is the racer\u2019s responsibility to ensure \nthey have selected the correct weight of \nwall ball relevant to their division (see \nbelow).\n \u2022\nThe racer must start by standing tall \n(hips and knees extended), holding the \nwall ball with both hands i.e. it is not \npermitted for racers to pick the wall ball \nup from the ground and immediately \nthrow it at the target. \n \u2022\nThe racer then squats below parallel and \nthrows the ball (with both hands) as they \nstand up, striking the correct target on \nthe wall ball rig - this is counted as one \nrepetition.\nFig: 011\n\nRULEBOOK DOUBLES_\nHYROX EN Doubles Rulebook R1 Season 2025/26\n28\n \u2022\nEach wall ball throw must strike the \ndesignated target i.e. female racers \nmust hit their target in the strike zone, \nmale racers must hit their target in the \nstrike zone.\n \u2022\nAfter the ball touches the target, the \nracer either catches the ball and initiates \nthe movement again or alternately, \nthe racer allows the wall ball to hit the \nground before starting the movement \nagain i.e. standing tall, hips and knees \nextended before commencing the \nsquat. Racers are not permitted to catch \nthe ball after it bounces and continue \nwith the next repetition. \n \u2022\nAt the bottom position of the squat, \nthe racer\u2019s hips must descend lower \nthan their knees (also known as; below \nparallel or below 90\u00b0).\n \u2022\nThe resting DTM must remain in the \nmarked area underneath the rig without \nobstructing other racers. Failure to do so \nwill result in no-rep(s) for as long as the \ninfringement occurs.\n \u2022\nThe transition of the wall ball between \nDTM\u2019s is by either allowing the ball to \ngo to the floor or by handing it between \nthemselves. A flying transition where one \nDTM throws the ball to the target and \nthe other DTM catches it in the squat and \nkeeps moving is not permitted. Doing so \nwill result in a no-rep. \n \u2022\nWhere no digital targets are in use, \nracers may only proceed to the Finisher \nStage once their Judge confirms that \n100 valid Wall Ball repetitions have been \ncompleted.\n \u2022\nRacers are permitted to remove \ntheir shoes once they arrive at their \ndesignated target. The racer must \nplace the shoes under the rig. After \ncompleting 100 valid wall balls the racer \nis required to take their shoes with them \nto the Finisher Stage - racers are not \npermitted to return to the wall ball area \nafter completing their race. \n \u2022\nRacers must NOT run underneath the \nwall ball rig when making their way to \nthe Finisher Stage - they must go via the \noutside of the wall ball rig.\n \u2022\nIf a team breaches any of these \nrequirements, that repetition will be \ndeemed a \u2018no rep\u2019.\nFig: 013\nFig: 012\n\nRULEBOOK DOUBLES_\nHYROX EN Doubles Rulebook R1 Season 2025/26\n29\nWOMEN \n100 reps with 4 kg (white marking)\nWOMEN PRO / MEN \n100 reps with 6 kg (grey marking)\nMEN PRO \n100 reps with 9 kg (black marking)\nTarget height WOMEN and WOMEN PRO  \n2.70 meter\nTarget height MEN and MEN PRO  \n \n3.00 meter \nNote 1: Digital Wall Ball Target Protocol\nWhen digital Wall Ball targets are in use, the system will automatically register both valid reps \nand no-reps. These will be displayed in real-time on the racer interface.\nJudges are responsible for assessing the racer\u2019s starting position and squat depth. If a no-rep \nis identified by the Judge, it will be recorded using their digital interface and displayed on the \nracer\u2019s screen.\nRacers may only proceed to the Finisher Stage once they confirm their digital interface shows \nthat 100 valid Wall Ball repetitions have been completed.\nIf the racer leaves their station before reaching 100 valid reps, they will not be called back to \ncomplete the remainder. Instead, a 15-second time penalty will be applied for each incomplete \nrepetition.\nNote 2: Squat Depth Boxes\nA squat depth box may be used at the Judge\u2019s discretion to assist in assessing whether a \nracer\u2019s squat meets the required depth. They cannot be requested by a racer. These boxes are \nnot to be used for resting or sitting - they serve solely as a depth indicator, not as a resting \nopportunity during the workout.\nWall Ball Penalty Protocol\n \u2022\nNo warnings are given, it is either a rep \nor a no-rep.\n \u2022\nEach missing rep will incur a 15-second \npenalty.\n \u2022\nIf a racer uses powdered chalk at the \nwall ball workout station, a 2 minute \npenalty will apply.\n\nRULEBOOK DOUBLES_\nHYROX EN Doubles Rulebook R1 Season 2025/26\n30\n10.

EVENT DAY SCHEDULE\nOn event day, participants will encounter the following areas.\n12.1 Registration, Timing Chip and Wristbands\nOnce racers arrive at the venue, they will need to attend the racer Check-in area where they \nwill receive their timing chip/ankle strap, racer number and wrist lanyard. \nRacers need to bring a government issued photo ID and their registration confirmation.\nDepending on the division, the wristband will be either white, grey or black and/or green. This \nis used to identify the participant\u2019s start wave and division during the race and must be worn \nvisibly on the wrist. \nEach racer also receives a timing chip for recording the racer\u2019s time(s) during the race. This \nchip must be attached to an ankle. \nAny other position may lead to an invalid or incomplete time record - it is the racer\u2019s \nresponsibility to wear the timing chip correctly on an ankle throughout the race. Doubles and \nrelays must carry one chip per participant. Doubles = 2 Timing Chips; Relay = 4 Timing Chips.\n12.2 Changing Rooms and Bag Drop Area\nChanging rooms and a secure bag drop will be available at the venue.

Time penalties depend on the \ninfringement and Station. \nMany penalties are automatically detected by the timing system using chip reads \u2014 for example, \nincorrect use of the IN/OUT arches or missing sled laps.\nInfractions related to movement standards or rep counts \u2014 such as using the wrong weights, \nfailing to return kettlebells correctly, or a no-rep on wall ball squats \u2014 can be penalised in real \ntime by Judges or Head Judges.\nOnly Race Directors have the authority to disqualify (DQ) a racer, based on input from Head \nJudges, Judges, or their own direct observations.\nFor Stations 1\u20137, racers will receive one warning per station for not meeting movement \nstandards. On the second infringement - regardless of type - the repetition is deemed invalid \nand the racer will receive the associated time or distance penalty. Any further violations within \nthe same station will incur additional penalties. \nNote: Certain violations may result in immediate penalties without warning, depending on \ntheir severity.\n13.1.1 Missing Run Laps\nIf a racer does not run the correct number of laps, a time penalty of 3-7 minutes per lap will be \napplied and added to their final result time.\nFor example: For a specific venue, the time penalty could be 5 minutes. The racer\u2019s final result \ntime is 1:24 but if they missed 2 run laps throughout the race their final result time will be 1:34 \n(2 x 5 minute penalties).\n\nRULEBOOK DOUBLES_\nHYROX EN Doubles Rulebook R1 Season 2025/26\n36\n13.1.2 Completing the Stations in the Incorrect Order\nIf a racer does not complete the station in the correct sequence (1-8), they are permitted to \ncomplete missing stations prior to entering Station 8 (Wall Balls). \nCompleting the stations in the incorrect order will result in a 3-minute penalty. If more than \none is completed out of order, the participant will automatically be disqualified.\n13.1.3 Missed / Missed 1K Run\nMissing an entire station or 1K run will lead to a disqualification.\n13.1.4 Confusion of Roxzone IN and OUT\nEach time a racer runs into the Roxzone via the OUT arch, or out of the Roxzone via the IN arch \nthey will receive a 2-minute penalty.\n13.1.4 Doubles Partners Not Staying Together\nIn the Doubles division, both partners must remain together at all times during the race, \nincluding all running segments and workout stations. The automatic timing system continuously \nmonitors partner proximity.\n\nEach time the system detects that partners are not together, a 1-minute time penalty will be \napplied - per run segment and/or workout station where the infringement occurs. A maximum \nof three penalties is allowed per team. \nIf a fourth infringement is recorded, the team will be classified as Out of Competition and will \nnot appear in the official rankings.\n\u201cRemain together\u201d is defined as being no more than five seconds apart at any time. Best \npractice is to stay within arm\u2019s reach of each other throughout the race to avoid triggering a \npenalty and to maintain smooth transitions between segments.\n13.3 Did Not Finish\nIf a participant does not finish a station they will not receive any results data and will be \nexcluded from all rankings and awards. However, they may continue with the race (without a \nfinal time).\n\nRULEBOOK DOUBLES_\nHYROX EN Doubles Rulebook R1 Season 2025/26\n37\n13.4 Disqualification\nIf a participant has been disqualified by a Race Director during a race, they will not receive \nany results data from that race and will be excluded from all rankings and awards related to it. \nOnce disqualified, the participant may not continue competing in that specific race.\n13.5 Deviations from the Movement Standards\nAny execution of a movement that either deviates from the movement standards, and/or is \nunusual or uncommon and/or results in a time advantage will not be recognised and will \nresult in an invalid repetition (no rep) or a time penalty.\n\nRULEBOOK DOUBLES_\nHYROX EN Doubles Rulebook R1 Season 2025/26\n38\n14. RULES OF CONDUCT\n\nBy registering for a HYROX event, racers are agreeing to compete in a fair and honorable \nmanner. Poor sportsmanship e.g., attempts at deception, manipulation, excessive disputes as \nwell as disrupting and/or obstructing other participants can lead to penalties, disqualification, \na lifetime ban from HYROX races and/or legal action. \nAny participant who is disqualified from a HYROX race or banned from future events will not \nreceive a refund for any fees or dues. This also applies to behavior that could harm or disturb \nparticipants, volunteers, staff, sponsors and spectators. Any of the aforementioned actions \nmay be taken against any participant at the discretion of event organisers.",

The race was \ndesigned by Mintra Tilly, who also wrote the rulebook.\nHYROX consists of a 1 km run followed by 1 station, \nrepeated 8 times. In order to complete the entire \nHYROX race and receive a valid finishing time, the \nracers must complete the runs and stations in the \nspecific order [Run 1, workout station 1, Run 2, \nworkout station 2, etc.] until they have completed a \ntotal of 8 km running and 8 stations.\nWhilst the repetition range and/or weights differ \nbetween the divisions, the running distance remains \nthe same across all divisions: each racer must run 1 \nkm before each, i.e. a total distance of 8 km.\nThe results and ranking system are based on the \nfastest time in each respective division. Results \nare sorted from the fastest to the slowest time. In \naddition to the overall fastest men\u2019s and women\u2019s \ntimes, results are also ranked in age groups [see \nbelow], also sorted from the fastest to the slowest \ntime.\n\nHYROX EN DOUBLES RULEBOOK_25/26\n5\n2 CONDITIONS OF \nPARTICIPATION\nHYROX is a race open to everyone, qualifications are \nnot required.\nBy participating in HYROX you are agreeing to the \nfollowing conditions, which include the exclusion of \nliability and the terms of the Privacy Policy which can \nbe read at https://hyrox.com/terms-and-conditions/.\n1 \nIn order to participate in a HYROX event, racers \nmust be at least 16 years old on the day of race.\n2 \nOfficial rankings will be based on racers\u2019 biological \ngender at birth. However, individuals who wish to \nparticipate for recreational purposes only, without \nbeing included in the official ranking, may register \nunder their gender identity.\n3 \nEach racer must agree to the terms and conditions \nof participation.\n4 \nThe only way to register for a HYROX event is via \nwww.hyrox.com.\n2.1 CONDITIONS OF \nPARTICIPATION IN HYROX\n2.2 PRECONDITIONS FOR \nPARTICIPATION\nPregnant women are welcome to participate. However, \nthe participation in any race during pregnancy \nremains solely at the discretion and responsibility \nof the pregnant individual.

The divisions differ in gender and/\nor weight being moved, pushed or pulled. The RELAY split remains the \nsame across all divisions: each RELAY Member (RM) has to run 2x 1 k and \nperform 2 workout stations. \nBelow are the required weights/distances for the RTMs:\n\nHYROX EN Relay Rulebook R1 Season 2023/24\n 3\n  RULEBOOK TEAM RELAY_\n\n3.2 HYROX TEAM RELAY Age Groups (applies to all divisions)\n(a) U40 \n(b) 40+\nAge groups are determined by the participant\u2019s age at the date of the \nevent. In addition, the age groups are classified based on the average age \nof the four RELAY participants at the time of the event. E.g. RELAY \nMember (RM) 1 is 24 years old, RM 2 is 38, RM 3 is 48 and RM 4 is 40, the \naverage age is 37.5, the RELAY Team will be classified into age group (a). \u2028\n3.2 Ranking System\nOur ranking system and the resulting overall ranking is based on the \nfastest time in the respective division of each event. Results are sorted \nfrom the fastest to the slowest time. In addition, there will be a ranking \nwithin the age groups, also sorted from the fastest to the slowest time.\nThe results will be published immediately after the event ends and \navailable at hyrox.com. \nPenalties, etc. may be added up to 48 hours after the event ends. Any \nincomplete running laps or improperly executed repetition or deviation \nfrom the prescribed standard of movements is considered invalid and \nleads to a penalty (see penalties).\nHYROX EN Relay Rulebook R1 Season 2023/24\n 4\n  RULEBOOK TEAM RELAY_\n\n4. THE COMPETITION\nHYROX TEAM RELAY is a 4-person-team competition. The RELAY Team \ncan consist of 4 male athletes, 4 female athletes or 2 female and 2 male \nathletes.\nThe competition consists of a 1 k run followed by one workout, repeated 8 \ntimes. In order to complete the entire HYROX TEAM RELAY Race and \nreceive a valid finishing time, the participants must complete the runs and \nworkouts in the designated order (run, workout 1, run, workout 2, etc.) \nuntil they have completed a total of 8 k running and 8 workouts as a team.\nEach RELAY Member (RM) has to run 2x 1 k and perform 2 workout \nstations.  The use of each RM is entirely up to the team. However, the relay \nalways starts with 1 k of running followed by the workout station.\nThis means one RM can either perform 2x 1 k runs and 2 workout stations \nconsecutively or can come back into the relay at another point. \n4.1 Workout Stations\nThe Team must complete 8 workout stations in total in the designated \norder 1-8. Each RM has to complete 2 workout stations. A workout station \nis completed when the entire distance or repetitions are covered. \n4.2 Workout Station Rules and Regulations\n\u2022\nComplete all workouts, in the correct order.\n\u2022\nPerform each exercise according to the movement standards.\n\u2022\nUse the correct start and finish points of the workout-station.\n\u2022\nComplete the correct number of repetitions and/or distances.\n\u2022\nPerform the exercises/movements with the correct weight in kg or lbs.\nHYROX EN Relay Rulebook R1 Season 2023/24\n 5\n  RULEBOOK TEAM RELAY_\n\n4.3 Running\nThe running distance is always 1,000 m, and depending on the venue it \nthis will be split into 2-4 running laps. In some cases the first/last running \nlap may not be exactly 1,000 m due to a staggered start. In this case, the \nmissing metres will be balanced out during the last lap.\nOn the run course there is a line dividing the running course into two \nspeed zones: fast lane, and regular speed. Faster athletes should run in \nthe fast lane and slower athletes in the regular speed lane.\n4.4 Transition Zone\nThe Transition Zone (TZ) is where the RM exchange takes place. Up until \nthe actual exchange, only one RM is allowed in this zone per RELAY Team. \nThe RM who is up next is only allowed to enter shortly before the \nexchange. No loitering is allowed in this zone. It is the responsibility of \neach RELAY Team to make sure their RTMs get into the TZ on time. \nOnce a RM has finished his/her workout station, they must run into the TZ \nto meet with the RM who is up next.\nIMPORTANT: If a RM performs 2 runs and workouts back to back, they \nneed to run through the TZ after each workout due to timing chip reasons.\nThe exchange must follow this protocol: \nRM 1 finished the workout and enters the TZ. He/she then taps RM 2 on \nthe shoulder.  This is the signal for RM 1 to leave the TZ as fast as possible. \nOnly after RM 1 entered the TZ and performs the shoulder tap, RM 2 is \nallowed to leave the TZ and start the run. This is the only time that 2 RM\u2019s \nof the same team are allowed to be in the TZ.  \nThe TZ is located inside the Roxzone and can be entered from the \nspectator area by passing the crossing point. The exact location of this \nzone will be posted on site and will be marked in the venue map.\nHYROX EN Relay Rulebook R1 Season 2023/24\n 6\n  RULEBOOK TEAM RELAY_\n\n4.5 Referees and Head Judges\nFor each workout a referee will be responsible for ensuring all participants\ncomplete the workout in the correct and safe manner. The referee does \nthis in coordination with the head judge of the respective workout station. \nThe head judge of each workout station is managed by the race director, \nwho oversees all sporting aspects of the competition and makes the final \ndecisions on all judging matters.\n \nAll decisions of the Race Director and event organisers are final.\n6.  MOVEMENT STANDARDS, DISTANCES AND WEIGHTS\nAny execution of a movement that either deviates from the movement \nstandards, and/or is unusual or uncommon and/or results in a time \nadvantage will not be recognised and will result in an invalid repetition \n(no rep) or a time/distance penalty depending on the workout station.\nIn addition, The assignment to the equipment or lane for each workout \nstation will be allocated by the respective Head Judge and his team.\nHYROX EN Relay Rulebook R1 Season 2023/24\n 7\n  RULEBOOK TEAM RELAY_\n\n6.1 SkiErg*\n\u2022\nPrior to starting the workout the monitor must be (re)set by a referee.\n\u2022\nThe athlete\u2019s feet must remain on the SkiErg platform at all times during \nthe exercise.

          "snippet": "# HYROX Doubles Strategy Guide: How to Race as a Team\n\nThink HYROX Doubles is just \"Singles but with a friend\"? Think again.\n\nHYROX Doubles is a popular and growing format that fundamentally changes race strategy, demands different training approaches, and requires teamwork skills that Singles athletes never develop.\n\nHere's what most people get wrong: they assume Doubles is easier because \"you split the work.\" But the reality is that\n\n**both athletes run the full 8km**, and success depends on strategic station division, communication, and complementary strengths\u2014not just fitness.\n\nIn this guide, we'll show you exactly how to approach HYROX Doubles using data-backed strategies and proven tactics from thousands of successful teams.\n\n## What is HYROX Doubles? (The Actual Format)\n\nLet's start by clarifying the format, because there's a lot of confusion about what Doubles actually involves.\n\n### The Format:\n\n**Running:**\n\n- Both athletes run ALL 8 x 1km runs\n\n- You run 8km total (same as Singles)\n\n- You MUST run together as a team (this is a rule)\n\n**Stations:**\n\n- ONE athlete works while the other rests\n\n- You complete the SAME total volume as Singles (split between you)\n\n- You decide how to divide the work at each station\n\n**The Work (Total Team Volume):** **SkiErg:**1000m total (split however you want) **Sled Push:**50m total **Sled Pull:**50m total **Burpee Broad Jumps:**80m total **Rowing:**1000m total **Farmers Carry:**200m total **Sandbag Lunges:**100m total **Wall Balls:**100 reps total\n\n**Key Insight:** You're running the FULL 8km like Singles, but you can rest during stations while your partner works. This fundamentally changes energy management and strategy.\n\n## Why HYROX Doubles is Popular\n\nHYROX Doubles has become an increasingly popular format among HYROX athletes. Here's why:\n\n### 1. Social Appeal\n\nTraining for HYROX can be lonely and grueling. Doubles adds a social component that makes the journey more enjoyable. You're accountable to someone besides yourself, and shared suffering builds bonds.\n\n### 2. Strategic Depth\n\nThe best Doubles teams aren't just two fit people\u2014they're strategically matched athletes who complement each other's strengths and cover weaknesses through smart station division.\n\n### 3. Mental Support\n\nYour partner can push you through those dark moments that would break you in Singles. When you're suffering at station 6, having someone there who believes in you makes all the difference.\n\n### 4. Different Challenge\n\nSome athletes prefer the team dynamic and strategic complexity of Doubles over the pure individual grind of Singles. It's not easier or harder\u2014it's different.\n\n### 5. Entry Point\n\nFor athletes not quite ready for full Singles volume, Doubles offers a way to experience HYROX competition while splitting station work. You still run 8km, but station recovery is built in.\n\n## Singles vs Doubles: What Actually Changes?\n\nUnderstanding these differences is critical for strategy.\n\n### Running Demands\n\n**Singles:** You run 8km, resting during stations\n\n**Doubles:** You ALSO run 8km, but your partner is working stations during your run\n\n**Implication:** Running fitness matters just as much (maybe more) in Doubles. You can't hide a weak run.\n\n### Station Recovery\n\n**Singles:** Brief rest between runs and stations\n\n**Doubles:** Extended rest during partner's station work (30s-3min depending on station)\n\n**Implication:** You can go harder on your station work because you get built-in recovery.\n\n### Energy Management\n\n**Singles:** Pace conservatively to finish all 8 stations\n\n**Doubles:** Can push harder on your assigned station work since you rest while partner works\n\n**Implication:** Strategic aggression pays off more in Doubles than Singles.\n\n### Pressure and Accountability\n\n**Singles:** Only accountable to yourself\n\n**Doubles:** Don't want to let your partner down\n\n**Implication:** Mental game shifts dramatically\u2014some thrive on team accountability, others crumble under pressure.\n\n## Choosing the Right Partner: Data-Driven Selection Criteria\n\nThe #1 mistake we see? Choosing a partner because they're your friend/spouse/training buddy without considering compatibility.\n\n### Fitness Level Matching\n\n**General guidance:** Aim for partners within **15-20% of each other's fitness level** for best compatibility.\n\nToo close = limited complementary strengths\n\nToo far apart = frustration, imbalanced workload, poor race execution\n\n**How to Test Compatibility:**\n\n**Test 1: Benchmark Workout**\n\nFor Time:\n\n- 1km run\n\n- 500m row\n\n- 40 wall balls\n\n- 500m row\n\n- 1km run\n\nCompare times. If you're within 3-4 minutes, you're well-matched.\n\n**Test 2: Individual Station Tests**\n\nTest each station at race weight:\n\n- SkiErg 1000m\n\n- Sled Push 50m\n\n- Sled Pull 50m\n\n- Row 1000m\n\n- Wall Balls 100 reps\n\nIf both athletes complete within 25% of each other on most stations, good compatibility.\n\n**Test 3: Running Pace Compatibility**\n\nDo a 5km run together at \"comfortably hard\" pace. Since you MUST run together in Doubles, this test is critical. Can you maintain the same pace without one partner struggling?\n\n**Critical Point:** If one partner is a 45min 5K runner and the other is a 30min 5K runner, Doubles will be challenging. You'll be forced to run at a compromise pace\u2014the faster runner will be held back, the slower runner will be pushed beyond comfortable pace. Aim for partners with similar running ability.\n\n### Complementary Strengths Strategy\n\n**Option A: Balanced Team (Recommended for Most)**\n\n- Both athletes proficient at all stations\n\n- Similar running speed\n\n- No major weaknesses\n\n- Consistent, predictable performance\n\n**Advantage:** Flexibility. Any station split works. Low risk.\n\n**Option B: Strength/Endurance Split**\n\n- Partner A: Stronger on power stations (Sleds, Wall Balls, Farmers)\n\n- Partner B: Better engine (SkiErg, Row, Burpees, Running)\n\n- Requires careful station division strategy\n\n**Advantage:** Higher ceiling if executed well. Each athlete plays to strengths.\n\n**Option C: Power/Bodyweight Split**\n\n- Partner A: Explosive power, heavy lifting strength\n\n- Partner B: Bodyweight efficiency, cardio endurance\n\n- Most complex to plan and execute\n\n**Advantage:** Maximum efficiency on paper. Can shave 2-3 minutes off time.\n\n**Risk:** If one partner hits failure, the whole plan collapses.\n\n### Age and Gender Considerations\n\n**Mixed Gender Teams:**\n\nConsider weight differences for weighted stations. Many successful mixed teams have the male partner handle more Sled Push/Pull and Farmers Carry volume, while the female partner takes more Burpees, Wall Balls, and machine work where technique and pacing matter more than absolute strength.\n\n**Same Gender Teams:**\n\nEasier to match fitness levels, but requires more strategic thinking about station division since you can't rely on natural strength differences.\n\n**Age Gaps:**\n\nA 25-year-old and 45-year-old CAN team successfully if fitness levels align. Age matters less than current fitness and recovery capacity.\n\n## Station Division Strategy: The 5 Approaches\n\nHere's where Doubles gets interesting. You have\n\n**five main strategies** for dividing station work, each with trade-offs.\n\n### Strategy 1: Even Split (50/50)\n\n**How it works:** Divide every station exactly in half.\n\n- SkiErg: 500m each\n\n- Sled Push: 25m each\n\n- Rowing: 500m each\n\n- Wall Balls: 50 reps each\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Simple to execute\n\n- Fair workload distribution\n\n- Easy to pace\n\n- Minimal mid-race decisions\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Doesn't capitalize on individual strengths\n\n- More transitions = more time lost (5-10 seconds per switch)\n\n- Requires both athletes to be competent at everything\n\n**Best for:** Evenly matched teams, first-time Doubles, or when consistency matters more than speed.\n\n**Pro Tip:** The athlete finishing their portion should immediately prep for partner (adjust erg height, move equipment, etc.).\n\n### Strategy 2: Strength-Based Division\n\n**How it works:** Each partner \"owns\" their best stations and does significantly more volume there.\n\n**Example Division:**\n\n- Partner A (stronger): 100% Sled Push, 100% Sled Pull, 70% Wall Balls, 60% Farmers\n\n- Partner B (better engine): 100% SkiErg, 100% Row, 70% Burpees, 40% Farmers, 30% Wall Balls\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Maximizes team efficiency\n\n- Each athlete plays to strengths\n\n- Faster potential finish time\n\n- Less time standing around\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Requires deep knowledge of each partner's abilities\n\n- Risk of one partner hitting complete failure\n\n- Harder to pace\n\n- Communication critical\n\n**Best for:** Experienced teams with clear, complementary strength/weakness profiles.\n\n**Warning:** If the \"strong\" partner gasses out on their assigned stations while the \"cardio\" partner is fresh, you've lost your advantage. This strategy has high ceiling but high risk.\n\n### Strategy 3: Alternating Reps (Tag-Team Style)\n\n**How it works:** Switch frequently\u2014every 5-10 reps or every 100-200m.\n\n**Example Wall Balls:**\n\n- Partner A: Reps 1-10\n\n- Partner B: Reps 11-20\n\n- Partner A: Reps 21-30\n\n- Continue alternating to 100 total\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Constant recovery for both athletes\n\n- Maintains high intensity throughout\n\n- Good psychological boost from frequent switches\n\n- Works well for long, grinding stations\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Lots of transitions (can cost 15-30 seconds per station)\n\n- Requires perfect communication\n\n- Can disrupt rhythm\n\n- Chaotic equipment management\n\n**Best for:** Wall Balls, Burpees, Lunges, SkiErg, Rowing.\n\n**Not recommended for:** Farmers Carry (awkward to switch mid-carry).\n\n### Strategy 4: Volume-Based Uneven Split\n\n**How it works:** One athlete does 60-70%, the other does 30-40%, based on who's stronger at that specific station.\n\n**Example:**\n\n- SkiErg: Partner A 700m, Partner B 300m (A has better pull power)\n\n- Sled Push: Partner B 35m, Partner A 15m (B is stronger)\n\n- Row: Partner A 650m, Partner B 350m\n\n- Wall Balls: Partner B 65 reps, Partner A 35 reps\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Balances total effort across all stations\n\n- Prevents any one athlete from completely emptying the tank\n\n- More flexibility than 50/50 but less chaos than alternating\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Requires trial and error in training to find right percentages\n\n- Hard to adjust mid-race\n\n- Need to track distances/reps carefully\n\n**Best for:** Teams with moderate fitness differences looking to equalize total workload across the race.\n\n### Strategy 5: \"Specialist\" Approach (Advanced)\n\n**How it works:** One athlete does 100% of certain stations, partner does 100% of others. Zero splits.\n\n**Example:**\n\n- Partner A: 100% SkiErg, 100% Row, 100% Burpees, 50% Lunges\n\n- Partner B: 100% Sled Push, 100% Sled Pull, 100% Farmers, 100% Wall Balls, 50% Lunges\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Zero transition time at most stations\n\n- Maximum efficiency\n\n- Each athlete \"owns\" their domain\n\n- Very fast when executed perfectly\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Extremely high risk of failure\n\n- No backup plan if one athlete struggles\n\n- Requires elite fitness and mental toughness\n\n- Not adjustable mid-race\n\n**Best for:** Elite Pro Doubles teams with extensive race experience together. **We don't recommend this for 95% of teams.**\n\n## What We're Seeing in Competition\n\nBased on observation of Doubles teams at races, here's how competitive teams approach station division:\n\n### The Even Split Paradox\n\n**50/50 with one switch (traditional approach):**\n\n- Minimizes transition time (only 1 switch per station)\n\n- BUT typically results in slower overall pace\n\n- Each athlete working longer intervals = more lactic acid buildup = pace drops\n\n**Why this is slower:** When you work a long interval without switching, intensity drops to manage fatigue. You're forced to go slower to complete your full portion.\n\n### High-Frequency Switching (Most Popular Among Competitive Teams)\n\n**Volume-based uneven split with tag-team style:**\n\nShort work intervals with frequent transitions allow athletes to maintain much higher intensity without accumulating excessive lactic acid. Most competitive teams use this approach:\n\n**SkiErg:**Alternate every 100-200m (3-5 switches total) **Sled Push:**Switch every 12.5m or even 6.75m (very frequent - 4-8 switches) **Sled Pull:**Switch every 12.5m or 6.75m (4-8 switches) **Burpees:**Alternate every 5-10 burpees (8-16 switches across the 80m) **Row:**Alternate every 200-250m (4-5 switches) **Farmers Carry:**Switch at 100m (turnaround) or more frequently **Lunges:**Switch every 20-25m (4-5 switches) **Wall Balls:**Alternate every 10-20 reps (5-10 switches for 100 total reps)\n\n**Why This Works:**\n\n- Maintains much higher intensity throughout the station\n\n- Short work intervals = less lactic acid accumulation\n\n- Partner gets brief recovery while other works\n\n- Can push near-maximal effort for short bursts\n\n- Overall station time is faster despite more transitions\n\n**The trade-off:** Requires excellent communication and smooth transitions, but the intensity benefit far outweighs the small transition time cost for most competitive teams.\n\n## Pacing Strategy for Doubles\n\nSingles athletes often go out too hard and blow up. Doubles teams often make a different mistake:\n\n**they pace too conservatively because they fear \"letting their partner down.\"**\n\n### What We Observe in Competition\n\n**Fast-finishing teams:** Tend to be aggressive early, establishing rhythm and confidence from the start\n\n**Conservative teams:** Often start cautiously but still end up fatigued because they never found momentum\n\n**Common pattern:** Teams that push harder intensity early (while staying controlled) often report feeling better throughout the race than teams who \"save energy\"\n\n**Why Higher Intensity Can Work:** Since you get built-in recovery during your partner's station work, you can afford to push harder during your working intervals than you would in Singles. The frequent switches in popular strategies also provide micro-recovery.\n\n### The 4-Station Rule\n\n**Stations 1-4:** Attack at 85-90% effort. Build confidence. Establish momentum.\n\n**Stations 5-6:** Maintain 80-85%. This is the danger zone\u2014don't implode, but don't coast.\n\n**Stations 7-8:** Empty the tank. Give everything left. Nothing to save for.\n\n**Running:** Just because your partner is working doesn't mean you jog your run. Maintain steady pace at 75-80% effort. Your rest comes during their station work, not during your run.\n\n## Race Day Execution: Station-by-Station Tactics\n\n### Pre-Race Preparation\n\n**60 Minutes Before:**\n\n- Both warm up together (same area, similar protocol)\n\n- 10-15 min easy jog together\n\n- Dynamic stretching\n\n- 2-3 practice reps on each station at 50% effort\n\n- Final strategy review: station divisions, who starts what\n\n**30 Minutes Before:**\n\n- Light mobility only\n\n- Visualize first three stations\n\n- Check equipment locations together\n\n- Mental preparation: positive self-talk\n\n**At the Start Line:**\n\n- You'll run all laps together as a team (required by rules)\n\n- Agree on target run pace beforehand\n\n- Quick fist bump: \"Trust the plan. Support each other. Let's execute.\"\n\n### Station-by-Station Breakdown\n\n**Station 1: SkiErg (1000m total)** **Goal:**Establish rhythm without overcooking **Division:**600/400 or 500/500 based on pulling strength **Pacing:**Controlled first 200m, steady push rest of the way **Transition:**Second athlete adjusts erg height BEFORE first finishes **Common Mistake:**Going too hard, blowing up the arms early\n\n**Station 2: Sled Push (50m total)** **Goal:**Maintain leg drive, don't blow up quads **Division:**Stronger pusher does 30-35m, partner does 15-20m **Technique:**Low pad position, short choppy steps, drive through legs **Transition:**Minimal. Second athlete ready to go immediately. **Common Mistake:**Standing up too tall, using arms instead of legs\n\n**Station 3: Sled Pull (50m total)** **Goal:**Consistent hand-over-hand rhythm **Division:**Similar to push (stronger partner does more) **Technique:**Lean back, use bodyweight, smooth pulls **Transition:**Clean rope management **Common Mistake:**Going too hard early, arm fatigue ruins you\n\n**Station 4: Burpee Broad Jumps (80m total)** **Goal:**Maintain pace, don't slow down **Division:**Alternate every 10 burpees (roughly 10m each) OR 50/30 split **Technique:**Chest to floor, explosive jump forward, find rhythm **Mental:**This is where races separate. Stay aggressive. **Common Mistake:**Starting too fast, death marching the last 30m\n\n**Station 5: Rowing (1000m total)** **Goal:**Use legs, not just arms. Hold split pace. **Division:**600/400 or 500/500 based on rowing ability **Technique:**Legs-back-arms on drive, arms-back-legs on recovery **Recovery:**Partner 1 actively breathes during partner 2's row **Common Mistake:**All arms, no legs. Split pace falls apart.\n\n**Station 6: Farmers Carry (200m total)** **Goal:**Don't set weights down **Division:**100m each (switch at turnaround) OR 120/80 if grip strength differs significantly **Technique:**Small quick steps, upright posture, controlled breathing **Strategy:**Whoever has weaker grip goes first (slightly fresher) **Common Mistake:**Too long steps, holding breath, setting weights down\n\n**Station 7: Sandbag Lunges (100m total)** **Goal:**Consistent step count, no stopping **Division:**50m each (switch at turnaround) **Technique:**High carry position, back knee touches ground, stay tall **Mental:**You're in the home stretch. Dig deep. **Common Mistake:**Bag slips low, posture collapses, steps get shorter\n\n**Station 8: Wall Balls (100 reps total)** **Goal:**Finish strong, unbroken sets **Division:**Alternate sets of 10 (5 switches total) OR 60/40 based on leg endurance **Technique:**Catch low, use leg drive, steady rhythm **Final Push:**Last 30 reps\u2014empty the tank completely **Common Mistake:**Breaking too early, losing rhythm, missing target\n\n### Communication Protocol\n\n**Before Each Station:**\n\n- Quick reminder of division plan\n\n- \"I'm taking first 500m\" or \"You're doing 30m\"\n\n- No long discussions\u2014you decided this in training\n\n**During Station:**\n\n- Encouragement only: \"Good pace!\" \"Strong!\" \"Almost there!\"\n\n- Zero negative comments\n\n- Don't coach technique mid-race (too late)\n\n**Between Stations:**\n\n- \"You good?\" (quick status check)\n\n- Adjust next station if needed: \"I'm gassed, you take more\"\n\n- Hype each other up: \"We're on pace!\" \"Crushing it!\"\n\n**Final 2 Stations:**\n\n- \"Leave it all out there!\"\n\n- \"Everything we've got!\"\n\n- Maximum encouragement and support\n\n## Training Together vs Training Apart\n\n**The Ideal Split:** 70-80% separate training, 20-30% together.\n\n### Separate Training (4-5 days/week per athlete):\n\n- Individual running workouts (see our running structure guide)\n\n- Personal strength sessions\n\n- Station technique work\n\n- Individual weaknesses focus\n\n- Allows each athlete to train at their own pace and intensity\n\n### Together Training (1-2 days/week):\n\n- Station transition practice\n\n- Communication drills\n\n- Race pace simulation\n\n- Strategy testing and refinement\n\n- Mental preparation and team building\n\n### Monthly Benchmark (Critical):\n\nOnce per month, do a race simulation together:\n\n**Full Sim (Weeks 6, 10):**All 8 stations + 8km running each **Half Sim (Weeks 3, 7):**4 stations + 4km running each\n\nTrack total time, identify bottlenecks, adjust strategy, test different station splits.\n\n## Sample 12-Week Doubles Training Plan\n\nHere's a framework for training as a Doubles team:\n\n### Weeks 1-4: Build Base + Find Compatibility\n\n**Individual (4-5x/week per athlete):**\n\n- Follow standard HYROX running structure\n\n- 2 strength sessions per week\n\n- Individual station work at sub-race intensity\n\n- Build aerobic base\n\n**Together (1x/week):**\n\n- Practice 4 stations together (rotate which ones each week)\n\n- Focus: communication, finding natural division strategy\n\n- 60-90 minute sessions\n\n**Week 3 Benchmark:** Half simulation (4 stations + 4km each)\n\n### Weeks 5-8: Build Intensity + Refine Strategy\n\n**Individual (4-5x/week per athlete):**\n\n- Increase interval intensity (tempo runs, VO2 max work)\n\n- Race-weight station work\n\n- Strength maintenance (not building\u2014maintaining)\n\n**Together (1x/week):**\n\n- Saturday or Sunday: Practice full 8 stations (not racing, just executing)\n\n- Test different station division strategies\n\n- Time each station individually\n\n**Week 6 Benchmark:** Full simulation (all 8 stations + 8km each) at 85% effort\n\n### Weeks 9-10: Race Simulation + Peak\n\n**Individual (3-4x/week per athlete):**\n\n- Maintain intensity, slightly reduce volume\n\n- Focus on recovery\n\n- Dial in nutrition and hydration strategy\n\n**Together (1x/week):**\n\n- Week 9: FULL race simulation at 95% effort (treat like a race)\n\n- Week 10: Half simulation at race pace\n\n- Focus: execution, communication, final strategy tweaks\n\n**Week 10 Benchmark:** Final full simulation\u2014everything dialed in\n\n### Weeks 11-12: Taper + Race\n\n**Individual:**\n\n- Week 11: 2-3 easy runs, 1 light strength session, extra rest days\n\n- Week 12: 1-2 easy 20-30min runs, mobility only\n\n**Together:**\n\n- Week 11: One 30-minute session practicing ONLY transitions\n\n- Week 12: Race week\u2014one final strategy meeting 2 days before race\n\n**RACE DAY:**Execute the plan\n\n## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them\n\n### Mistake #1: Not Practicing Transitions\n\n**The Problem:** Transitions waste 30-60 seconds per station. Fumbling with equipment, confusion about who goes next, awkward handoffs.\n\n**The Fix:** Dedicate one training session per month JUST to transitions. Practice switching on wall balls 50 times until it's automatic. Practice sled handoffs. Make it muscle memory.\n\n### Mistake #2: No \"Plan B\"\n\n**The Problem:** Partner hits unexpected fatigue, gets a cramp, or performance drops. Team panics. Race implodes.\n\n**The Fix:** Discuss contingencies before the race:\n\n- \"If I'm gassed, you take 70% of next station\"\n\n- \"If I cramp, I go easy pace but keep moving\"\n\n- \"If one of us is crushing it, we adjust stations 6-7-8\"\n\nFlexibility wins races. Rigid plans break under pressure.\n\n### Mistake #3: Poor Communication Under Fatigue\n\n**The Problem:** At station 6, when you're both suffering, communication breaks down. Assumptions are made. Plans fall apart.\n\n**The Fix:** Practice communication protocols in training simulations. Use simple, clear language. \"You good?\" \"I'm taking more here.\" No complex discussions during the race.\n\n## Doubles vs Singles: Which Should You Choose?\n\nStill not sure if Doubles is right for you? Here's a decision framework:\n\n### Choose HYROX Doubles If:\n\n\u2705 You want the social/team aspect of racing with a partner\n\n\u2705 You have a compatible training partner (similar fitness, aligned schedules)\n\n\u2705 You enjoy strategic planning and teamwork dynamics\n\n\u2705 You want built-in station recovery (rest while partner works)\n\n\u2705 You're introducing someone to HYROX\n\n\u2705 You prefer accountability and shared goals\n\n### Choose HYROX Singles If:\n\n\u2705 You want complete control over pacing and strategy\n\n\u2705 You don't have a compatible partner or schedules don't align\n\n\u2705 You prefer solo training and independent racing\n\n\u2705 You've done Doubles and want to test yourself individually\n\n\u2705 You're targeting elite times or podium finishes (more competition in Singles)\n\n\u2705 You like the simplicity of \"just you vs. the course\"\n\n**Pro Tip:** Many athletes do Doubles for their first 1-2 races to learn the HYROX format with built-in support, then transition to Singles once they understand the demands. There's no wrong path\u2014both are legitimate challenges.\n\n## The Mental Game of Doubles\n\nRacing with a partner adds psychological complexity. Here's how to navigate it:\n\n### Positive Self-Talk Template:\n\n**When you're struggling:**\n\n\"I've trained for this. One rep at a time. My partner needs me. I can do hard things.\"\n\n**When partner struggles:**\n\n\"I've got this. I can pick up the slack. We're a team. I'll carry us through.\"\n\n**When both are suffering:**\n\n\"Everyone hurts at station 6. We push through together. We trained for exactly this moment.\"\n\n### Managing Partner Dynamics:\n\n**If you're the stronger athlete:**\n\n- Don't show frustration if partner is slower than expected\n\n- Focus on encouragement, not criticism\n\n- Be ready to adjust strategy and take more volume\n\n- Remember: they're doing their absolute best\n\n**If you're the weaker athlete:**\n\n- Don't apologize or self-deprecate mid-race\n\n- Focus on your job, execute your reps, give maximum effort\n\n- Communicate honestly: \"I'm good\" or \"I need you to take more\"\n\n- Your partner respects effort and grit, not just speed\n\n**For balanced teams:**\n\n- Stay positive even when things go sideways\n\n- Adapt together without blame\n\n- Celebrate small wins between stations\n\n- Finish strong regardless of placement\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Q: Do we both run all 8km, or do we split the running?**\n\nA: Both athletes run the FULL 8km (8 x 1km runs each). You do NOT split the running. The advantage in Doubles is that ONE person works at stations while the other rests, but running volume is the same as Singles.\n\n**Q: How do we decide how to split the stations?**\n\nA: Test in training. Try 50/50 splits first, then experiment with 60/40 or 70/30 on stations where one partner is significantly stronger. The division that lets you finish fastest while both athletes maintaining effort is optimal.\n\n**Q: Do we have to run together during the race?**\n\nA: Yes, you MUST run all laps together as a team. This is a rule in HYROX Doubles. You need to agree on a sustainable pace that works for both partners. This is why running compatibility is so important when choosing a partner.\n\n**Q: What happens if one partner can't continue mid-race?**\n\nA: The other partner can complete the race solo, but you'll likely be marked DNF as a team. Better strategy: injured/struggling partner moves slowly but keeps going. A slow finish beats a DNF.\n\n**Q: Is Doubles easier than Singles?**\n\nA: Different, not necessarily easier. You run the same 8km, but you get built-in recovery during stations. For athletes who struggle with running, Doubles doesn't really help. For athletes who struggle with station endurance, Doubles can feel easier since you rest while your partner works.\n\n**Q: Can we change our strategy mid-race?**\n\nA: Absolutely! The best teams adapt in real-time. If the plan was 50/50 Wall Balls but Partner A is crushing it, audible to 60/40 or 70/30. Communication and flexibility are critical.\n\n**Q: How close in fitness do we need to be?**\n\nA: Within 15-20% of each other's fitness level is ideal. Test with benchmark workouts. If one partner would finish a Singles race in 1:20 and the other in 1:50+, that's a challenging gap. Aim for closer alignment.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nHYROX Doubles is a unique race format that rewards:\n\n\n\n**Strategic planning** (station divisions that play to strengths)\n\n\n\n**Communication** (real-time adjustments under fatigue)\n\n\n\n**Teamwork** (supporting each other through suffering)\n\n\n\n**Adaptability** (flexibility when things don't go to plan)\n\nSuccess in Doubles isn't about having two elite athletes\u2014it's about two well-matched partners who train smart, communicate clearly, execute a solid plan, and support each other when it gets hard.\n\nWhether you're building up to Singles or Doubles is your preferred format, the key is intentional preparation. Test your strategy in training. Know your strengths. Trust your partner. Execute the plan.\n\nTrain smart. Communicate clearly. Trust each other. Go crush it together. \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**Related Articles:**\n\n- How to Structure Your HYROX Running Training\n\n- HYROX Beginner Training Plan\n\n- What is a Good HYROX Time?\n\n- Station Performance Analysis\n\n- Common Beginner Mistakes in HYROX\n\n*Analysis based on 700,000+ HYROX race results including thousands of Doubles teams.

          "snippet": "**Divisions: Open vs. Pro, Men/Women/Mixed Doubles**\n\nHYROX offers several divisions to suit different athletes. In addition to individual (solo) races, there is a Doubles division open to everyone. In doubles, you and your partner (either two men, two women, or one of each in mixed teams) run the entire course together and split the exercises however you choose. There's no rule that you must split the work evenly \u2013 one partner can even do all the reps of a station if that makes tactical sense. The key is that only one partner works at a time, following a \u201cyou go, I go\u201d principle, while the other rests or gets ready to swap in.\nPro vs. Open: For experienced athletes seeking an extra challenge, HYROX also offers Pro Doubles divisions (for same-sex teams). Pro doubles follow the exact same format but with heavier weights at the workout stations. For example, in an Open Men's doubles race the wall ball weight is 6 kg, whereas in Pro Men's doubles it's 9 kg, and other stations have similarly increased loads for pros.\n(Women's Pro doubles use weights equivalent to the Open Men's standards in many stations, such as a 6 kg ball instead of the usual 4 kg.) Mixed doubles teams only compete in the Open category (there is no separate \u201cPro Mixed\u201d division at regular events), but note that the mixed teams use a hybrid weight setup \u2013 essentially male Open weights (and female Pro weights) for all stations.\n\n\u2026\n\nFor Doubles, both partners must accept within the deadline. As of Season 2025/26, qualification is generally tied to the Pro division (with exceptions such as 60+ athletes and Mixed Doubles, plus Regional Championship qualifiers). At the World Championships, most athletes race with Pro weights/reps; exceptions include Mixed Doubles and 60+ age groups (who race Open weights). Partner substitutions at World Championships are generally not permitted, and any exception (e.g., proven illness/injury) requires HYROX approval\u2014always check the latest official communications for your event.\nWorld Championship Racing: At the Worlds, all doubles competitors race on the biggest stage for the title of World Champion in their category. Notably, every doubles team at Worlds uses the Pro weights, regardless of whether they qualified through an Open division (the idea is to have a level playing field of max difficulty at the championship).\nThe only exceptions are mixed doubles and the oldest age groups: Mixed teams at Worlds use the men's Open weights (slightly lighter than full pro) to account for the gender difference, and any 60+ age group athletes also stick with Open-level weights. Within each age group at Worlds, the fastest team is crowned that Age Group's World Champion \u2013 a prestigious title on its own.",

          "snippet": "The Vienna race in late-February also featured many of Europe\u2019s best Hyrox athletes in the Pro division dropping down to the Open division. How did their performances compare to those we saw in Washington, DC just 5 weeks later? Most of the women in Vienna with a Pro PR under 75:00 tended to have an Open/Pro ratio closer to 0.90, but many of those with slower Pro PRs had a much lower ratio in Vienna, meaning they performed much better with Open weights compared to Pro.\n\n\u2026\n\nHowever, he isn\u2019t as heavy as a lot of the top men, so he often has slower zone times with the heavier Pro weights than top Pro athletes with similar run ability. A high-level runner, like Derek, can fight for an overall podium in the Open division at nearly any race due to lighter weights and his fast running, but it typically doesn\u2019t work the other way around when similar athletes move up to the Pro division. **Vienna**\n\n\u2026\n\nThat means less than 1/3 of your total time on course is spent in zones with heavier Pro weights (sled push, sled pull, farmer\u2019s carry, lunges, and wall balls). The athletes who tend to \u201cover-perform\u201d relative to their Pro PR when they switch to the Open division are the fastest runners.\n\nMaybe we\u2019ll never know the perfect ratio to predict an athlete\u2019s fastest Open time vs. their fastest Pro time. However, at least Lauren Weeks and Alexander Roncevic finally answered the question about how much faster a former Hyrox world champion can run using Open weights vs. Pro weights.\n\n## Discussion",

HYROX DOUBLES \u2014 OFFICIAL RULES\n\n### 1.1 The Fundamental Running Rule\n\n**Source: Official HYROX Doubles Rulebook Season 25/26, Section 8.2 (Running)**\n\n> *\"Both Doubles Team Members (DTMs) must run together for the entire 1,000m between each workout station. If one team member runs ahead, a 1-minute penalty will apply, as this changes the dynamic of a Doubles race.\"*\n\n**Key rules:**\n- \u2705 **BOTH partners MUST run ALL 8 \u00d7 1km runs TOGETHER**\n- \u274c You CANNOT split, alternate, or divide the runs in any way\n- Both partners must remain together throughout each 1km run segment\n- **\"Remain together\" is officially defined as being no more than FIVE SECONDS apart at any time**\n- **Best practice (per the rulebook): stay within arm's reach of each other**\n\n**Penalty for not staying together:**\n- Each infringement detected = **1-minute time penalty** (per run segment and/or workout station)\n- Maximum of **3 penalties** allowed per team\n- **4th infringement \u2192 Out of Competition** (no ranking, no official result)\n- The automatic timing system **continuously monitors partner proximity** via timing chips\n\n**What if one partner is significantly faster?**\n- The faster partner MUST slow down to match the slower partner\n- The faster partner effectively gets \"easier\" runs (running below their capacity)\n- The slower partner is pushed harder (running at or near their capacity)\n- This is why **running compatibility is the single most important factor** in partner selection\n\n### 1.2 Station Rules \u2014 The YGIG (You Go / I Go) Principle\n\n**Source: Official HYROX Doubles Rulebook Season 25/26, Section 8.2 (Station Rules)**\n\n> *\"It is up to each Doubles Team member (DTM) to determine how far in distance or how many reps they complete. Hyrox Doubles workstations follow the principle of 'You Go/I Go' (YGIG) which means whilst one DTM works, the other DTM rests and vice versa.\"*\n\n**CRITICAL CLARIFICATION: Both partners go to ALL 8 stations together. They do NOT each \"take\" separate stations.**\n\n**How it actually works (official example from rulebook):**\n> *\"YGIG Example 1,000 meter Row: DTM 1 starts rowing whilst DTM 2 waits. After a self selected distance (for example 250 meters) DTM 1 switches with DTM 2. DTM 2 continues to Row whilst DTM 1 rests. This process is repeated until the entire distance of 1,000 meters is covered.\"*\n\n**Key station rules:**\n- Only ONE DTM may be active (working) at any time\n- The other DTM must rest in the designated area\n- The split of reps/distance is **entirely up to the team** \u2014 no required ratio\n- One partner CAN do 100% of a station if desired (but the other must be present)\n- Both partners must **enter the station together** and **exit the station together**\n- The workout **cannot begin until both partners are present**\n- The station can only be exited **once all reps/distance are completed**\n- There is **NO required alternating pattern** \u2014 teams choose freely how to divide work at each station\n- The split does **NOT need to be decided in advance** \u2014 teams can adjust mid-race\n- Rest times during stations can be taken as needed, concurrently as well\n\n### 1.3 Station-Specific YGIG Rules\n\n**Source: Official HYROX Doubles Rulebook Season 25/26, Sections 9.1\u20139.8**\n\n| Station | Total Work | Resting DTM Position | Special Transition Rules |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **SkiErg** | 1,000m | Must remain in marked area | NOT allowed to pass SkiErg handles from one DTM to another |\n| **Sled Push** | 50m (4 \u00d7 12.5m) | Must walk immediately behind working DTM | Must not walk in neighboring lane |\n| **Sled Pull** | 50m (4 \u00d7 12.5m) | Must remain behind working DTM at all times | May NOT assist with rope management in any way (hands or feet). MAY offer verbal and physical guidance as long as they don't step on/in the Racer's Box |\n| **Burpee Broad Jump** | 80m | Must walk behind working DTM | When transitioning, resting DTM places hands where working DTM's feet landed (toes and fingers in line) |\n| **Rowing** | 1,000m | Must remain in marked area behind working DTM | NOT permitted to pass the rower handle, adjust damper, or adjust footstraps for each other |\n| **Farmers Carry** | 200m | Must walk behind working DTM | Kettlebells must NOT be passed forward during transitions (sideways or backwards only) |\n| **Sandbag Lunges** | 100m | Must walk behind working DTM | Sandbag must NOT be passed forward during transitions (sideways or backwards only) |\n| **Wall Balls** | 100 reps | Must remain in marked area underneath the rig | Transition of wall ball by allowing ball to hit floor or handing between DTMs. A \"flying transition\" (one throws, other catches in squat) is NOT permitted = no-rep |\n\n**Can you coach/encourage your partner during their station?**\n- \u2705 Yes \u2014 verbal encouragement is permitted and recommended\n- \u2705 At Sled Pull: \"It is permitted for the resting DTM to offer verbal and physical guidance\"\n- \u274c The resting partner must NOT obstruct other racers\n- \u274c The resting partner must NOT physically assist with the work (e.g., no touching rope, equipment)\n\n### 1.4 Complete Weight Table \u2014 ALL Doubles Divisions\n\n**Source: Official HYROX Doubles Rulebook Season 25/26, Sections 9.1\u20139.8 (full weight chart on p.8)**\n\n| Station | Women Open | Women Pro / Men Open / **Mixed** | Men Pro |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| SkiErg | 1,000m | 1,000m | 1,000m |\n| Sled Push | 102 kg incl. sled | 152 kg incl. sled | 202 kg incl. sled |\n| Sled Pull | 78 kg incl. sled | 103 kg incl. sled | 153 kg incl. sled |\n| Burpee Broad Jump | 80m | 80m | 80m |\n| Rowing | 1,000m | 1,000m | 1,000m |\n| Farmers Carry | 2 \u00d7 16 kg (white) | 2 \u00d7 24 kg (grey) | 2 \u00d7 32 kg (black) |\n| Sandbag Lunges | 10 kg (white) | 20 kg (grey) | 30 kg (black) |\n| Wall Balls | 100 reps / 4 kg (white) | 100 reps / 6 kg (grey) | 100 reps / 9 kg (black) |\n| Wall Ball Target (Women) | 2.70m | 2.70m | \u2014 |\n| Wall Ball Target (Men) | \u2014 | 3.00m | 3.00m |\n\n**CRITICAL NOTE on Mixed Doubles weights:**\n- **Both partners (male AND female) use the SAME weight** = Men's Open weights\n- This means the female partner in Mixed Doubles uses **heavier weights** than she would in Women's Open Doubles\n- The ONLY partial exception is Wall Balls: both use the 6 kg ball, but men throw to the **3.00m target** and women throw to the **2.70m target**\n- **There is NO Mixed Pro Doubles division** \u2014 Mixed Doubles only exists as Open\n\n**How do Doubles weights compare to Singles?**\n- **Doubles Open weights = Singles Open weights** (identical)\n- **Doubles Pro weights = Singles Pro weights** (identical)\n- The weights do NOT change between Singles and Doubles \u2014 only the station work is split between partners\n- The total volume at each station is identical to Singles (same 1,000m row, same 100 wall balls, etc.)\n\n### 1.5 Doubles Divisions Available (Season 25/26)\n\n| Division | Team Composition | Weights Used | Pro Version? |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Women's Doubles | Two female racers | Women's Open | \u2705 Yes (Women's Pro) |\n| Men's Doubles | Two male racers | Men's Open | \u2705 Yes (Men's Pro) |\n| Mixed Doubles | One male + one female | Men's Open (both partners) | \u274c No Pro Mixed |\n\n### 1.6 Timing & Transitions\n\n**Source: Official HYROX Doubles Rulebook Season 25/26, Sections 8.1\u20138.2**\n\n- The clock runs **continuously** from start to finish \u2014 one overall team time\n- Both partners wear individual **timing chips on their ankles** (2 chips per Doubles team)\n- The timing system continuously monitors both chips for proximity enforcement\n- There is **no designated \"transition zone\"** for Doubles (that's a Relay concept) \u2014 partners stay together throughout\n- Both DTMs must **enter** a workout station together (workout cannot begin until both present)\n- Both DTMs must **exit** a workout station together (after all reps/distance completed)\n- Exiting a workout station via the 'IN' arch = **2-minute time penalty**\n\n### 1.7 Doubles Running Pace Strategy\n\n**Based on the rules and verified coaching sources:**\n\n- Both partners run at the **slower partner's sustainable pace**\n- The faster partner effectively gets \"active recovery\" on runs \u2014 lower relative effort\n- The slower partner is working harder on runs \u2014 this is the tradeoff\n- Typical strategy: aim for the slower partner's **75-80% effort** pace on runs\n- The faster partner's \"rest\" comes from running below threshold; their station rest comes while partner works\n- **HR management implication:** The faster runner will have lower HR on runs, can push harder on stations. The slower runner will have higher HR on runs, may need more station rest or take a smaller share at some stations.\n\n### 1.8 Station Splitting Strategy\n\n**Based on verified coaching sources (HyroxDataLab, competitive experience):**\n\n**There is no required split pattern.** Teams have complete freedom. The five main approaches:\n\n| Strategy | Description | Best For |\n|---|---|---|\n| **50/50 Even Split** | Each partner does half of every station | First-timers, evenly matched teams |\n| **Strength-Based Division** | Each partner does more of their strongest stations (e.g., 70/30) | Experienced teams with complementary strengths |\n| **Tag-Team (Frequent Switching)** | Switch every 5-10 reps or 100-200m | Competitive teams wanting to maintain high intensity |\n| **Volume-Based Uneven Split** | 60/40 or 70/30 per station based on ability | Teams with moderate fitness differences |\n| **Specialist (100/0)** | One partner does entire stations, partner rests | Elite Pro teams ONLY \u2014 very high risk |\n\n**Most competitive teams use high-frequency switching** because:\n- Short work intervals = less lactic acid accumulation\n- Both partners maintain higher intensity\n- Built-in micro-recovery during partner's work interval\n- Overall station times are faster despite more transitions\n\n**Common station splitting based on partner attributes:**\n\n| If Partner A is... | Consider having Partner A take more of... |\n|---|---|\n| Stronger upper body | SkiErg, Sled Pull, Rowing |\n| Stronger lower body / heavier | Sled Push, Wall Balls, Sandbag Lunges |\n| Better cardio/engine | SkiErg, Rowing, Burpee Broad Jumps |\n| Better grip strength | Farmers Carry, Sled Pull |\n| Taller/heavier (male in Mixed) | Sled Push (bodyweight advantage), Farmers Carry |\n| Lighter/shorter (female in Mixed) | Burpee Broad Jumps (less distance per jump but less weight to move), Wall Balls |\n\n**Non-working partner rest durations (approximate):**\n- SkiErg 500m share: ~1:30\u20132:30 rest\n- Sled Push 25m share: ~0:30\u20131:30 rest\n- Sled Pull 25m share: ~0:45\u20131:30 rest\n- Burpee Broad Jump 40m share: ~1:30\u20133:00 rest\n- Rowing 500m share: ~1:30\u20132:30 rest\n- Farmers Carry 100m share: ~0:30\u20131:00 rest\n- Sandbag Lunges 50m share: ~1:30\u20132:30 rest\n- Wall Balls 50 reps share: ~1:30\u20132:30 rest\n\n### 1.9 Training for Doubles\n\n**Recommended split: 70-80% individual training, 20-30% together**\n\n**Together training (1-2x/week) should focus on:**\n- Running together at matched pace (critical for penalty avoidance)\n- Station transition practice (smooth YGIG switches)\n- Communication protocols under fatigue\n- Testing different station split strategies\n- Race simulations (monthly benchmarks recommended)\n\n**How to decide station splits:**\n1. Each partner tests all stations individually at race weight \u2014 record times\n2. Compare performance ratios at each station\n3. Assign more volume to the partner who is faster/stronger at each station\n4. Test the split in simulation\n5. Build in a \"Plan B\" for mid-race adjustments\n\n---\n\n## 2. HYROX RELAY \u2014 OFFICIAL RULES\n\n### 2.1 Format\n\n**Source: Official HYROX Relay Rulebook (Season 23/24 \u2014 latest publicly available)**\n\n- **4-person team competition**\n- Teams can be: 4 males, 4 females, or 2 males + 2 females (Mixed)\n- Same overall race structure: 8 \u00d7 1km runs + 8 workout stations\n- **Each Relay Member (RM) must run 2 \u00d7 1km and perform 2 workout stations**\n- The assignment of which RM does which runs/stations is **entirely up to the team**\n- An RM can do their 2 runs + 2 stations **consecutively** OR come back into the relay at a later point\n- Only **ONE** RM is on the course at a time (except during the transition exchange)\n\n### 2.2 Relay Transitions\n\n- A **Transition Zone (TZ)** exists inside the Roxzone\n- Only one RM per team allowed in the TZ at a time (until the actual exchange)\n- The next RM enters shortly before the exchange\n- Exchange protocol: RM 1 finishes station \u2192 enters TZ \u2192 **taps RM 2 on the shoulder** \u2192 RM 1 exits \u2192 RM 2 starts running\n- **IMPORTANT:** If an RM does 2 consecutive legs back-to-back, they **still must run through the TZ** after each workout (for timing chip reasons)\n\n### 2.3 Relay Weights\n\n**Relay uses the same weights as Open division (gender-specific):**\n\n| Station | Female RM | Male RM |\n|---|---|---|\n| SkiErg | 1,000m | 1,000m |\n| Sled Push | 102 kg incl. sled | 152 kg incl. sled |\n| Sled Pull | 78 kg incl. sled | 103 kg incl. sled |\n| Burpee Broad Jump | 80m | 80m |\n| Rowing | 1,000m | 1,000m |\n| Farmers Carry | 2 \u00d7 16 kg | 2 \u00d7 24 kg |\n| Sandbag Lunges | 10 kg | 20 kg |\n| Wall Balls | 100 reps / 4 kg / 2.70m target | 100 reps / 6 kg / 3.00m target |\n\n**Mixed Relay:** Each athlete uses the weight for their own gender (unlike Mixed Doubles where both use men's weight).\n\n### 2.4 Relay Strategy\n\n- Each athlete runs ~2.2km total (2 \u00d7 ~1.1km including Roxzone distance)\n- Each athlete does 2 complete stations (100% of each \u2014 no splitting within a station)\n- Teams choose which 2 stations each member does\n- **Each athlete must complete the run immediately preceding their assigned station**\n- Strategic assignment: put your strongest athlete on the hardest stations for them (e.g., strongest sled pusher does Sled Push + their choice of another)\n- Running order matters: consider fatigue management and who can handle back-to-back legs\n- Non-working teammates wait in the spectator area and move to the TZ when their turn approaches\n\n### 2.5 Key Differences: Doubles vs. Relay\n\n| Aspect | Doubles (2 people) | Relay (4 people) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Running per person | **8km (all 8 runs)** | **~2km (2 runs)** |\n| Stations per person | All 8 (split work at each) | 2 complete stations (100% of each) |\n| Partners on course | **Both always together** | **Only 1 at a time** |\n| Station work | YGIG \u2014 split reps/distance | One person does entire station |\n| Transition | No transition zone needed | Shoulder-tap in Transition Zone |\n| Total team volume | Same as Singles | Same as Singles |\n\n---\n\n## 3. COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS \u2014 CORRECTED\n\n| # | Misconception | Reality (Verified) |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1 | **\"You can split the runs\"** | \u274c NO. Both partners MUST run ALL 8 \u00d7 1km runs TOGETHER. Running is not divisible. Penalty: 1-min per infringement, DQ after 4th. |\n| 2 | **\"Each partner takes 4 separate stations\"** | \u274c NO. Both partners go to ALL 8 stations together. They split the WORK at each station (YGIG). Neither partner \"skips\" a station. |\n| 3 | **\"Doubles is half the work\"** | \u274c NO. You run the full 8km (identical to Singles). Station work is split, but running volume is 100% the same. |\n| 4 | **\"You must split stations 50/50\"** | \u274c NO. The split is entirely up to the team. One partner can do 100% of a station if desired. |\n| 5 | **\"There's a required alternating pattern\"** | \u274c NO. No required pattern. Teams choose freely how to divide each station's work. |\n| 6 | **\"Mixed Doubles uses Women's weights\"** | \u274c NO. Mixed Doubles uses MEN'S OPEN weights for BOTH partners. The female partner uses heavier weights than in Women's Doubles. |\n| 7 | **\"The non-working partner can help\"** | \u274c NO (mostly). The resting partner must NOT physically assist. No touching equipment, no passing handles, no rope management. Verbal encouragement IS allowed. |\n| 8 | **\"You can decide splits beforehand and that's final\"** | Partially wrong. You CAN adjust mid-race. Flexibility is recommended. |\n| 9 | **\"Relay is the same as Doubles but with 4 people\"** | \u274c NO. In Relay, each person runs only 2km and does only 2 full stations. In Doubles, each person runs all 8km and participates at all 8 stations. |\n| 10 | **\"Doubles weights are lighter than Singles\"** | \u274c NO. Doubles Open weights = Singles Open weights. Doubles Pro weights = Singles Pro weights. Identical. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. MIXED DOUBLES vs. SAME-SEX DOUBLES\n\n### 4.1 Weight Differences\n\n| Station | Women's Doubles (Open) | Men's Doubles (Open) | Mixed Doubles |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Sled Push | 102 kg | 152 kg | **152 kg (Men's weight for BOTH)** |\n| Sled Pull | 78 kg | 103 kg | **103 kg (Men's weight for BOTH)** |\n| Farmers Carry | 2 \u00d7 16 kg | 2 \u00d7 24 kg | **2 \u00d7 24 kg (Men's weight for BOTH)** |\n| Sandbag Lunges | 10 kg | 20 kg | **20 kg (Men's weight for BOTH)** |\n| Wall Balls | 4 kg / 2.70m | 6 kg / 3.00m | **6 kg / Men: 3.00m, Women: 2.70m** |\n\n**Key implication:** The female partner in Mixed Doubles faces significantly heavier weights than in Women's Doubles. This means:\n- The male partner often takes a larger share of weighted stations (sled push, sled pull, farmers carry, sandbag lunges)\n- The female partner may take more of the machine work (SkiErg, rowing) and bodyweight work (burpees) where the weight difference doesn't apply\n- This creates a natural strategic asymmetry that same-sex teams don't have\n\n### 4.2 Rule Differences\n- Mixed Doubles exists as **Open only** \u2014 there is NO Mixed Pro Doubles division\n- At World Championships, Mixed Doubles weights **remain the same** (not bumped to Pro)\n- Same-sex Doubles teams at Worlds are bumped to Pro weights (for AG under 60)\n\n### 4.3 Strategy Differences\n- Mixed teams tend to have the male partner handle significantly more of the weighted stations\n- The female partner typically excels at bodyweight stations and machine work where gender-neutral volumes apply\n- Running pace matching is even more critical in Mixed Doubles since men and women often have different natural running paces\n- Successful Mixed Doubles teams report the male often does 60-80% of Sled Push/Pull and Farmers Carry, while the female does 60-80% of SkiErg, Rowing, and Burpees\n\n### 4.4 Popularity\n- Mixed Doubles is very popular \u2014 it's one of the most common entry points for couples/training partners\n- Same-sex Men's and Women's Doubles are also popular, especially for competitive athletes targeting Worlds qualification\n- No verified data on exact participation ratios was found\n\n---\n\n## 5.
