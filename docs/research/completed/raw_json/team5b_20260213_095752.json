Pooled standard mean difference (SMD) of different studies and the corresponding 95\u00a0% confidence intervals (CIs) quantified effect sizes, with inconsistency models assessing heterogeneity and surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values ranking protocols by optimal probability.\n\n\u2026\n\n^4^ Current research primarily focuses on comparing APRE, VBRT, and RPE with PBRT, as well as investigating the effects of velocity loss thresholds in VBRT on strength development.^11^ Existing evidence indicates that VBRT surpasses PBRT in maximal strength improvement,^4^ attributed to its superior neuromuscular adaptation through higher concentric velocities, lower perceived fatigue, and reduced training loads.^12^^,^^13^ Similarly, APRE^14^^,^^15^ and RPE^9^^,^^16^^,^^17^ have demonstrated advantages over PBRT in enhancing maximal strength.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe RPE regulates training load based on participants' subjective perception of fatigue, sharing a similar regulatory framework with VBRT. While VBRT utilizes objective measures of velocity loss to monitor fatigue, RPE depends on the subjective escalation of fatigue as its termination criterion. As a result, training cessation prompted by increased subjective fatigue may limit its effectiveness in developing maximal strength compared to APRE.\nGraham's study^9^ attributes RPE's superiority over PBRT to its capacity to sustain higher training intensity, a rationale that aligns with one of the mechanisms underlying VBRT's advantage over PBRT. Both RPE and VBRT, which share threshold-based termination principles (i.e., discontinuing training upon reaching predefined subjective or objective thresholds), exhibit inferior efficacy in enhancing maximal strength compared to APRE.\n\n\u2026\n\n## 5. Conclusion\n\nThis systematic review and network meta-analysis demonstrates that ART significantly outperforms PBRT in enhancing maximal strength. Among them, APRE demonstrated the highest efficacy, with the back squat and bench press 1RM ranking first, followed by VBRT and RPE. Future research should explore the application of these autoregulated training methods across diverse populations and sport-specific contexts to establish a more robust evidence base for personalized training paradigms.",

Decreased values of LF were associated with highest adjusted risk (1.70, 95 % CI [1.37\u20132.09], p=0.001) of all HRV parameters.\n\n\u2026\n\nImportantly, in both these studies, there were observed reductions in performance after the training overload period, when HRV was substantial higher. Accordingly, in such cases, increases in HRV are indicative of coping with intensified training (i.e. F-OR), not increases in performance. Improved performance was only observed after the taper period when HRV had reduced back towards baseline levels.\n\n\u2026\n\nRecently, Vesterinen et al. investigated the effectiveness of using HRV to prescribe training on a day-to-day basis.[57] Forty recreational endurance runners were divided into the HRV-guided experimental training group (EXP) and traditional pre-defined training (TRAD). After a 4-week preparation training period, the TRAD group trained according to a predefined training programme including two-to-three moderate (MOD) and high-intensity training (HIT) sessions per week during an 8-week intensive training period.\n\n\u2026\n\n53] The MOD/HIT session was programmed if HRV was within an individually determined smallest change. Otherwise, low-intensity training was performed. VO~2~ max and 3,000 m running performance were measured before and after both training periods. The number of MOD and HIT sessions was significantly lower (p=0.021, effect size 0.98) in the EXP group (13.2 \u00b1 6.0 sessions) compared with TRAD (17.7 \u00b1 2.5 sessions).\n\n\u2026\n\nThis was despite the HRV-guided training group performing HIT sessions less frequently than a traditional training group (average three compared with 4-hour HIT sessions per week). Hence, adaptation was improved when lower intensity training was completed when vagal modulation of HR was attenuated.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe TRAD group did not improve significantly in any of these performance measures after their training period. This again supports the possible efficacy of HRV-G training being a suitable method to enhance training adaptations in athletes.\n\n\u2026\n\nHowever, there was also a small increase in resting RMSSD (effect size = 0.26) associated with decreases in performance. This supports the idea that, although HRV measures can be useful, they should still be used alongside other measures of training tolerance to aid decision-making.",

Despite being established as a training framework since the 1940s, there has been limited systematic research investigating its broad utility. Instead, researchers have focused on disparate practices that can be considered specific examples of the broader autoregulation training framework. A primary limitation of previous research includes inconsistent use of key terminology (e.g., adaptation, readiness, fatigue, and response) and associated ambiguity of how to implement different autoregulation strategies. Crucially, this ambiguity in terminology and failure to provide a holistic overview of autoregulation limits the synthesis of existing research findings and their dissemination to practitioners working in both performance and health contexts. Therefore, the purpose of the current review was threefold: first, we provide a broad overview of various autoregulation strategies and their development in both research and practice whilst highlighting the inconsistencies in definitions and terminology that currently exist. Second, we present an overarching conceptual framework that can be used to generate operational definitions and contextualise autoregulation within broader training theory. Finally, we show how previous definitions of autoregulation fit within the proposed framework and provide specific examples of how common practices may be viewed, highlighting their individual subtleties.\n\n## Key Points\n\n|Autoregulation is described by an emergent process that can be used to systematically individualise physical training. This is achieved through a flexible framework that enables practitioners to continually adjust training programmes over time based on measurement of an individual\u2019s performance.|\n|--|\n|Despite substantial developments since the 1940s, the lack of an overarching framework has led to inconsistencies in definitions and terminology used throughout associated research and practice. This has led to an ambiguity surrounding how best to implement a range of autoregulation strategies in practice, and a lack of synthesis within research.|\n|Future research should focus attention on identifying key features of the measurement and adjustment process that can be used to identify and define general autoregulatory principles and/or guidelines.|\n\n## Introduction: Autoregulation of Training, Perceived Benefits, and Continued Development\n\nThe concept of individualisation is widely accepted within sport and exercise science [1]. Following this perspective, it is commonly believed that purposefully adjusting training to coincide with measurements of an individual\u2019s response to training- and non-training-related stressors (e.g., sleep, nutrition, and illness) can both maximise increases in performance and deter the onset of maladaptive symptoms such as injury and overtraining [2, 3]. In practice, this individual response is frequently estimated by measuring performance in one or more tests thought to assess the physical quality (e.g., strength, power, and aerobic capacity) being trained [4]. The general concept that training should be adjusted in accordance with measurements of an individual\u2019s performance (and potentially perceptions of ability to perform) is referred to as autoregulation [5]. Here, the prefix \u2018auto\u2019 refers to regulation based on measurements made on the individual being measured, and not to highlight that the process is required to follow automated rules. At present, two broad implementations of autoregulation are presented in research. The first and most prevalent approach is to measure and adjust training daily [6] to reflect high-frequency fluctuations in performance that may be caused by both training- and non-training-related stressors. In contrast, the second approach measures and adjusts training on a less frequent basis (e.g., weekly or at the end of monthly short training blocks) to reflect more chronic changes in performance that are caused primarily by training-related adaptations in both central and peripheral systems [7]. Whilst researchers have focused on these two common approaches in isolation, a combination of the two may be implemented in practice to encourage a more continuous adjustment of training that better responds to the changing dynamics of an individual [6]. Based on the range of approaches available to researchers and practitioners, a more general perspective is to view autoregulation as a malleable training framework (Fig. 1) that permits systematic adjustment of training variables based primarily on the assessment of an individual\u2019s performance [6].\n\nA growing evidence base indicates that the autoregulation of training may be superior to well-designed training regimes that feature predetermined loading strategies for targeting physical qualities such as strength [7\u20139] and accretion of lean body mass [10]. Where increased effectiveness due to autoregulation has been observed, hypotheses relate to a closer match between the intended and delivered training stimulus on a session by session basis and/or at the programme level [11]. These hypotheses generally stem from the observation that in the traditional approaches to exercise programming, longitudinal blocks of training are prescribed using a singular baseline measure of performance taken prior to the beginning of a training cycle (e.g., 1RM testing prior to a strength phase) [12]. While this approach enables practitioners to prescribe training with some degree of individualisation [13], researchers have argued that the fixed nature across time may lead to periods of sub-optimal loading [14]. Periods of mismatch between the desired training stimulus and that which is received may be due to both day to day fluctuations in an individual\u2019s performance and short-term adaptations causing improvements to be substantially greater (or lesser) than expected [15]. It has, therefore, been suggested that adjusting the training received to coincide with more current estimations of an individual\u2019s performance\u2014as is the case with autoregulation\u2014may be advantageous to ensure sessions more closely align with an individual\u2019s current performance level and the overarching training goals [16].\n\nWhilst the main purported advantages of autoregulation relate to a better alignment of the intended training stimulus from a physiological standpoint, it has also been suggested that the framework may enhance psychological outcomes such as exercise adherence [17]. For example, some autoregulation practices enable individuals to self-select their training sessions from a predetermined pool based on their perceived capability to perform [8, 9]. It has been suggested that these variants of autoregulation may facilitate greater programme adherence and enjoyment due to increased autonomy [18]. To date, however, these latter hypotheses have yet to be systematically investigated and comparable methods of autoregulation have received limited study with research confined primarily to weightlifting [9], cycling [19], and powerlifting [8].\n\nWhilst the general concept of autoregulation of training was introduced in the 1940s [20], only recently has a range of novel implementation methods begun to emerge [21]. Developments have occurred due to both an increased awareness of the advantages of ongoing monitoring in both sport and health settings, as well as improved technologies enabling logistically feasible, accurate, and reliable measurement of physiological, performance, and perceptual data [4, 22]. Most developments in the autoregulation of training have occurred in sporting contexts where a culture of data collection is widespread, and practitioners routinely seek innovative methods to optimise performance [23]. Additionally, more novel measurement technologies are frequently emerging in sporting contexts, enabling practitioners to individually tailor training regimes using, for example, variables such as heart rate variability [24], blood and salivary biomarkers [25, 26], as well as perceptual measures of well-being and stress [27]. Whilst these measures are gaining increasing recognition as athlete monitoring tools [22], it is still relatively unclear how they relate to an individual\u2019s performance and whether they can be used to effectively adjust training. Additionally, whilst autoregulation and the subsequent individualisation of training may be more effective as a training strategy in health settings due to the extreme heterogeneity commonly observed (i.e., medical history, disease severity, and additional treatment regime), research regarding the implementation of autoregulation and other novel exercise frameworks in the health domain is limited [28]. Therefore, the current review will focus on the settings and methods most used in autoregulation research and practice. At present, this includes resistance training of athletes employing objective and subjective measurements of performance including examples such as countermovement jump (CMJ) kinematic and kinetic variables [29], barbell velocity [12], and measurements associated with rating of perceived exertion (RPE) [30]. Briefly, the collection and assessment of these variables represent the majority of research in the area and are commonly used to adjust both training intensity and volume [6, 16] over a range of timescales.\n\n## The Development of Autoregulation of Training\n\nIn this section, a brief chronological overview of autoregulation practices in resistance training is provided to outline the development and scope of strategies currently employed. DeLorme [20] is frequently credited with the initial development of autoregulation as a training framework in the 1940s [5]. DeLorme [20] observed in rehabilitation settings that adjusting the exercise load based on weekly performance of a ten-repetition maximum (RM) test resulted in superior improvements during a strength training programme compared to the traditional methods where increments in load were fixed. In 1979, Knight revised the work of DeLorme to include daily modifications in the load lifted based on an adjustment table (Table 1). Knight [31] proposed that more frequent adjustments were required to account for the consistent fluctuations in performance commonly observed during rehabilitation, as well as the highly individualised rate of strength progression [32]. The daily adjustable progressive resistive exercise (DAPRE) protocol developed by Knight [31] measured performance during the penultimate set of an exercise to momentary muscular failure at an estimated 6 RM load (Table 2). This performance was then used to adjust the resistance for the fourth and final set that would then be used to represent the new 6 RM estimate for the following session [33]. Since it first received empirical support [34], Knight\u2019s DAPRE protocol has gained popularity in physiotherapy practice [35], and remains a popular autoregulation protocol in the treatment of injuries and pathologies of the knee [35, 36].\n\n### Table 1.\n\nAdjustment table guidelines adapted from Knight [31], with permission\n\n|Number of repetitions performed|Adjustment required|Adjustment required|\n|--|--|--|\n|Number of repetitions performed|Fourth set^a^|Next session^b^|\n|\u2264 2|Decrease 5\u201310\u00a0lb|Decrease 5\u201310\u00a0lb|\n|3\u20134|Decrease 0\u20135\u00a0lb|Keep the same|\n|5\u20136|Keep the same|Increase 5\u201310\u00a0lb|\n|7\u201310|Increase 5\u201310\u00a0lb|Increase 5\u201315\u00a0lb|\n|> 10|Increase 10\u201315\u00a0lb|Increase 10\u201320\u00a0lb|\n\n*RM* repetition maximum\n\n^a^Adjustment in weight is based on performance during the third set\n\n^b^Performance in the fourth set is used as the new 6RM estimate to prescribe load in the following session\n\n1\u00a0lb\u2009=\u20090.45\u00a0kg\n\n### Table 2.\n\nCharacteristics of the original DAPRE protocol outlined by Knight [31]\n\n|Set|Percentage of 6RM estimate (%)|Repetitions performed|\n|--|--|--|\n|1|50|10|\n|2|75|6|\n|3|100|AMRAP|\n|4|Adjustment|AMRAP|\n\n*AMRAP* As many repetitions as possible, *DAPRE* daily adjustable progressive resistive exercise, *RM* repetition maximum\n\nDespite the success of the DAPRE protocol in rehabilitative settings, the training generated from the framework was perceived as monotonous and unlikely to transfer to broader training goals [35]. In 2000, Siff attempted to increase the scope of DAPRE by including 3, 6, and 10 RM variants that could be applied to target a range of physical qualities (power, strength, and hypertrophy) in a periodized manner, matching those commonly used by athletes [37]. Siff [37] was also the first author to popularise the term autoregulation when referring to training adjustments based on measurement of performance and is generally credited as being the first to apply autoregulation outside a rehabilitation setting.\n\nAs the concept of autoregulation grew in practice, it was recognised that frequently measuring performance through tests to momentary muscular failure may be unnecessary and potentially detrimental due to increased fatigue [5]. Therefore, alternative methods of autoregulation were introduced into the scientific literature. McNamara and Stearne [9] investigated the use of Kraemer and Fleck\u2019s [38] flexible nonlinear periodised (FNLP) model as an autoregulation strategy with inexperienced resistance trained males and females. The training practice enabled each individual to self-select their daily exercise session (either 10, 15, or 20 RM) based on their perceived performance capability [9] across each 4-week mesocycle, before completing the next block of training. The study compared performance increases over a 12-week intervention with a volume and intensity matched group that performed training sessions in a predetermined order. The FNLP group demonstrated significantly greater improvements in leg press 1 RM; however, they failed to show greater improvements in either chest press 1 RM or standing long jump. The authors concluded that there was strong theoretical support for the novel method and that the large difference in average improvements in leg press (62 vs. 16 kg) observed between the groups also provided empirical support. The extent to which these results were influenced by the inexperienced nature of the participants remains unclear; however, more recent research with well-trained participants showed no performance benefits with FNLP compared with a matched training program not featuring autoregulation when participants were allowed to self-select the order of their exercise sessions (strength, power, or hypertrophy) on a week-by-week basis [8].\n\nFollowing the study by McNamara and Stearne [9], both research and practice have focused predominantly on two of the most popular methods of autoregulation within resistance training: velocity-based training (VBT) [5] and perceptual measures of exertion [30]. The central premise of VBT is that the resistive load can be prescribed and manipulated with velocity ranges which target a desired physical quality, rather than as a percentage of a pre- determined 1RM. It has been hypothesised that this practice could account for daily fluctuations in performance and thereby enhances the overall training stimulus [39]. Recent studies provide support for an enhanced training stimulus with results demonstrating superior improvements in both maximal strength and CMJ performance for individuals following a VBT protocol compared to those following a percentage-based programme [12, 40]. However, to perform VBT, a device is required to accurately measure barbell velocity [41] and the accuracy of some devices have been shown to be limited [42\u201344]. In contrast, more accessible methods of autoregulation have been developed that do not require the use of sophisticated measurement devices. For example, Zourdos et al. [30] introduced and subsequently validated a modified RPE scale that has been used to regulate both the intensity and volume of exercise based on an athlete\u2019s perceived readiness [30]. To date, this method remains one of the most prevalent autoregulation strategies and has been shown to be an effective tool for multiple participant groups [16].\n\nBased on the brief overview above, it is clear that autoregulation of training has undergone substantial development since the 1940s; however, several limitations still exist. For example, while there is a general consensus that autoregulation can be defined as a training framework that permits the systematic adjustment of specific training variables (load, volume, and organisation) in line with daily and or weekly measurements of performance [5\u20137, 21], contradictions still exist in the description and use of key concepts and terminology. For example, readiness is a term that is often used to describe the phenomenon of short-term fluctuations in performance, or the perceived ability to perform exercise [21]. In this context, readiness is viewed as a means of autoregulating the training received based on changes in performance that are unanticipated and due primarily to non-training-related factors [28, 30]. In contrast, some authors have used readiness to refer to anticipated changes in performance that are more closely related to concepts such as adaptation and fatigue [45]. In addition, constructs such as adaptation [7, 30, 46], readiness [16, 47], and fatigue [45] are frequently used interchangeably when discussing the autoregulation of training. This has led to ambiguity and confusion regarding the relatedness of these constructs and whether adjustments to training should be made on the basis of one, multiple or all of these. As a result, there is a need for clear operational definitions that facilitate consistency amongst both researchers and practitioners, such that evidence can be better synthesised and evaluated. Moreover, a clear theoretical framework that identifies the most relevant features of the measurement and adjustment processes within autoregulation is required. Finally, refinement of key concepts and the overall structure of autoregulation will assist in identifying contemporary practices that may at first appear disparate, but can ultimately be viewed under the same framework, enabling more central questions to be addressed. Therefore, the purpose of this review was twofold. First, we sought to derive a conceptual framework that could be used to operationally define key constructs of autoregulation of training and enhance the consistency of future research. Second, we aimed to provide a brief discussion of how both historic and contemporary autoregulation methods may be contextualised by the framework presented herein to supplement its integration in practice.\n\n## Developing an Autoregulation Framework\n\nIn the following sections, we specify an autoregulation framework that provides operational definitions for the key constructs required in the measurement of performance. The framework builds upon the popular fitness\u2013fatigue model (FFM) to link training to performance. We also show how previous definitions and conceptions of autoregulation can be made consistent with the framework proposed. Additionally, we provide model examples to highlight subtleties in the framework and its application in practice.\n\n### Introduction to the Fitness\u2013Fatigue Model\n\nThe FFM is arguably the most influential model used to conceptualise the physical training process [48]. Originally developed by Banister et al. [49], the underlying principles of the FFM have become thoroughly engrained in sport and exercise science and provide the basic rationale behind a large body of contemporary practice [48]. In its most basic form, the FFM posits that a single bout of training creates two antagonistic after-effects including a long-lasting and low-magnitude positive fitness effect, and a negative short-lasting and high-magnitude fatigue effect [50]. Performance on a given day is, therefore, said to equal some baseline measure of performance plus the sum of the fitness and fatigue effects generated from all previous training sessions (Fig. 2). The FFM can also be viewed from a dose\u2013response perspective, such that larger doses of training are required to produce greater changes in performance.\n\nMathematical implementation of the FFM is described by a differential equation tailored to each individual, linking the training dose received (input) to a performance measure (output, e.g., vertical jump height, bench press RM, 40\u00a0m sprint time). Tailoring of the FFM is achieved by setting parameters in the equation to match the magnitude and decay rates of both the positive and negative after-effects experienced by the individual [50]. Since the model\u2019s original conception [49], multiple researchers have proposed updates to better reflect various empirically observed features of the training process (e.g., the residual effects of previous training sessions on future training). Whilst a number of limitations still exist (readers are referred to comprehensive reviews by Hellard [51] and Pfeifier [52]), the rich conceptual nature of the model and capability to derive actual predictions of performance, make the FFM a suitable candidate for developing an autoregulation framework with operationally defined constructs.\n\n### Using the Fitness\u2013Fatigue Model to Operationalise Autoregulation Constructs\n\nThe FFM developed by Banister et al. [49] is a deterministic model that assumes any change in performance can be attributed solely to training [53]. However, more comprehensive reformulations of the model have been devised to feature error components [54] that acknowledge the non-training-related stressors such as sleep, nutrition, and illness that can influence performance [55]. We propose that this stochastic error component can be viewed synonymously with the concept of readiness that is often used in the descriptions and definitions of autoregulation of training [16, 21, 28, 47, 56]. Under our reformulation of the FFM, it can be said that performance on a given day is equal to the sum of training- and non-training-related components, such that:\n\npt=p0+Fitness\u03a3t+Fatigue\u03a3t+Readinesst,\n\nwhere pt represents an individual\u2019s performance on the given day t; p0 is the baseline performance; Fitness\u03a3t is the sum of the fitness components across the training sessions; Fatigue\u03a3t is the sum of the fatigue components across the training sessions, and Readinesst is any change in performance caused by non-training-related stressors. Briefly, readiness can be conceptualised as a stochastic fluctuation in performance with a mean equal to 0 and variation equal to \u03c32. As shown in Fig. 3, the model can be presented graphically as a deterministic trace based on converting the training input to fitness and fatigue, which is then surrounded by a region of uncertainty which represents the non-training-related factors. From a conceptual standpoint, the integration of readiness as a component in the basic FFM highlights that adjustments to training generally need not be made unless the changes in performance differ from those that are expected as a result of the programme. In addition, we describe in Table 3 how changes in performance which are attributable to readiness on any given day could theoretically be estimated by subtracting observed performance from predicted performance (See Table 3 for definitions).\n\n#### Table 3.\n\nDefinition of key autoregulatory concepts under the proposed framework\n\n|Term|Definition|\n|--|--|\n|Autoregulation|An approach to exercise programming that adjusts training variable(s) based on the assessment of an individual\u2019s performance or perception thereof|\n|Performance|Performance is operationally defined as the sum of its constituents: fitness, fatigue, and readiness|\n|Expected performance|Expected performance is defined as the predicted performance based on training effects (fitness and fatigue) where readiness\u2009=\u20090|\n|Fitness|The positive effects on performance derived from training only|\n|Fatigue|The negative effects on performance derived from training only|\n|Readiness|The stochastic variation in performance that is attributable to non-training-related processes/stressors. Readiness can also be viewed as the difference between observed performance and expected performance|\n\nAs previously identified in this review, a range of potentially distinct constructs central to autoregulation of training have been used interchangeably, with adjustments to training recommended on the basis of readiness [21, 45, 47, 56], fatigue [16, 45], or adaptations [7]. Under the proposed framework presented in this review, these terms are unified and can be simply viewed as different constituents of performance. Therefore, the previous descriptions of autoregulation can be seen as adjustments that are made on the basis of measuring performance, where deviations may be disproportionately affected by one or more of the constituents. For example, with an untrained individual engaging in an intense strength training programme, it is probable that rapid increases in performance will occur [57]. In such a case, adjustments made to training through measurement of performance will be influenced primarily by fitness. In contrast, for individuals with substantial training experience, with well-developed physical characteristics, who are undergoing a maintenance block, there are likely to be minimal changes in performance that are attributable to training [58]. Instead, variations in performance (and therefore any adjustments made to training) will be influenced primarily by readiness. Other examples where non-training-related factors (readiness) are likely to dominate performance changes include those of clinical populations [28]. Here, the exercise dose prescribed is often conservative and the ability to perform exercise undergoes substantial deviations primarily due to factors outside the training process [28]. Finally, for high-level athletes undergoing periods of appropriately designed overreaching, it is probable that large decrements in performance will be observed [59]. Here, any adjustments made to training (usually a reduction in volume) can be said to be based primarily on fatigue and may be implemented if performance decrements become larger than those originally anticipated.\n\n## Application of the Framework\n\nIn this section, we present a brief overview of contemporary autoregulation practices and provide further context based on the proposed framework described within. The contemporary methods are presented based on the time-scale with which the autoregulation (measurement and adjustment) process occurs. Initially, we review autoregulation practices featuring adjustments within a single session. We then proceed to review methods that measure and adjust at the beginning of the session, and ultimately to practices that adjust at the meso- and macro-cycle level.\n\n### Within Session Autoregulation Methods\n\n#### Repetitions in Reserve\n\nCurrently, the most popular application of autoregulation is to adjust the exercise performed within a single session [47]. Within this time-scale, the two most popular methods of performance measurement include the repetition in reserve (RIR) scale and barbell velocity. Similarly, there exist two popular approaches to adjust exercise that include altering the load lifted or the volume performed. The RIR scale is a resistance training-specific variant of the Borg RPE scale originally devised by Tuchscherer [60], and is described more broadly as a perceptual measure of performance [45, 61]. The RIR scale provides a measure of exertion during resistance training by assessing how close an individual believes they are to momentary muscular failure [61]. Preliminary evidence for the validity of RIR-based assessment tools was first reported by Hackett et al. [62] who documented that individuals could better gauge resistance training intensity by estimating their perceived RIR in comparison to when ratings were given on the traditional Borg RPE scale. In particular, it was noted that individuals tended to provide submaximal ratings on the RPE scale even when sets were taken to momentary muscular failure [62]. Despite providing initial evidence in support of RIR-based prescription models, the results documented by Hackett et al. [62] were based strictly on an individual\u2019s perceived RIR and, therefore, had no corresponding RPE assignment [61]. Zourdos et al. [30] later integrated these two concepts, however, and were the first to investigate the validity of Tuchscherer\u2019s [60] proposed RIR scale (where each RPE value has a corresponding number of RIR) as a measure of resistance training intensity (Fig. 4). The results demonstrated that values given on the RIR scale were associated with proximity to momentary muscular failure as estimated by velocity during the back-squat exercise in both experienced and novice individuals [30, 61]. The RIR scale is now commonly used to autoregulate the training loads received based on daily fluctuations in performance levels [30, 61, 63]. This can be achieved by prescribing a specific RIR value and allowing the individual to self-select the load which they believe will elicit the corresponding exertion [56]. As an example, within a hypertrophy session, the autoregulation may call for 3 sets of 10 repetitions at an RIR of 2. In this case, the individual would self-select a load that they believe will result in momentary muscular failure on the 12^th^ repetition, stopping 2 repetitions short to perform a total of 10 repetitions [61]. As the session progresses, more objective adjustment criteria can be coupled with the individual\u2019s performance during the previous sets to more accurately select a load that corresponds with the prescribed intensity [63]. Based on the performance framework outlined in Sect. 3.2 of this review, it can be seen that RIR enables the resistive load lifted to be autoregulated in line with fluctuations in an individual\u2019s performance (i.e., maximum strength). In the case of a novice, these loads may increase on a weekly basis due to large increments in fitness. In contrast, for experienced individuals at the end of a training phase where minimal adaptations are occurring (Fitness\u03a3t and Fatigue\u03a3t are balanced), autoregulation of the loads lifted based on RIR will be primarily influenced by readiness and the associated daily fluctuations caused by non-training-related stressors.\n\nThe RIR scale can also be used to systematically autoregulate sessional training volume using the so-called RIR stop points [16, 60]. In contrast to the previous example where the load was manipulated to achieve the desired stimulus, when autoregulating session volume, the load is often fixed and the number of sets (volume) adjusted to match the individual\u2019s performance. For example, an initial load may be selected for 10 repetitions and an RIR stop point of 2 selected. If the individual was able to perform the exercise for 10 repetitions with the potential to perform at least two more repetitions, then additional sets at the same load would be performed. In contrast, if the individual upon performing the exercise does not believe that they could have performed 12 repetitions, then the particular exercise or the session may be terminated. Within the framework outlined in this review, the actual number of sets (i.e., training volume) will be autoregulated to correspond with fluctuations in performance caused by training (fitness and fatigue) and non-training-related factors (readiness). At present, there has been limited research investigating the use of RIR for the autoregulation of training volume, and that which has been conducted has been restricted to the deadlift, squat, and bench press exercises [16]. Hence, further research of RIR stop points within wider programming contexts is required.\n\n#### Within-Session Autoregulation Methods: Velocity-Based Training\n\nVBT is a novel method that has also become popular as a means of autoregulating both resistance training intensity and volume [21]. Training intensity is adjusted based on manipulating the load lifted within a session and the observation that a very strong inverse relationship exists between the load lifted as a percentage of an individual\u2019s maximum and barbell velocity across a range of both upper [39, 64] and lower body [65, 66] exercises. Researchers have used this relationship to translate training programs that are commonly expressed as a percentage of an individual\u2019s 1RM into corresponding velocity ranges [5]. For example, instead of prescribing a load of 80% 1RM, an average velocity range of 0.45\u20130.55 m/s may be given. In practice, a range of velocities can be prescribed that correspond with the physical quality targeted (e.g., strength or power) [21]. The individual then selects a load, such that the first repetition produces a movement velocity within the prescribed range when maximum intent is applied. In an autoregulation context, performance is the movement velocity achieved with a given load, and this will change based on fitness, fatigue, and readiness.\n\nJovanovic and Flanagan [67] proposed a more detailed autoregulation practice for adjusting the load lifted with movement velocity. They recommended building individualised load\u2013velocity profiles and subsequently measuring velocity during a multi-set warm-up protocol [67]. The actual velocity obtained could then be compared with the load\u2013velocity profile to ensure that the load lifted accurately reflected the desired %1RM for that exercise [67]. Where this is not the case, the load\u2013velocity profile could be used to provide an adjusted estimate of the load for subsequent sets [67]. As illustrated in Fig. 5, this adjustment process is generally achieved using the load\u2013velocity profile to first estimate an individual\u2019s daily 1RM, and subsequently calculating the load required to achieve the desired %1RM. The loads used for the remainder of the session may then better reflect the individual\u2019s current level of performance, enabling practitioners to more accurately apply the intended training stimulus.\n\nAs fatigue produces a transient decline in force generating capacity [68], movement velocity can also be associated with an individual\u2019s level of exertion [67, 69]. As a result, this relationship can be used in the measurement of performance and the adjustment of exercise volume within a session. Two common VBT methods that have been implemented within the literature involve terminating a set when velocity decreases either by a given percentage [70, 71], or when velocity drops below an absolute value [67]. In both cases, predetermined objective criteria are used to create thresholds that bind an individual to a limited number of repetitions. In an 8-week training intervention conducted by Pareja-Blanco et al. [71], repetitions performed in the back squat were adjusted by terminating a set when velocity dropped by either 20% or 40% of the velocity obtained during the first repetition. Following completion of the intervention, the 40% group achieved greater improvements in muscular hypertrophy, whilst the 20% group achieved greater improvements in strength and power [71]. In addition, recent research suggests that there is a stable relationship between proximity to momentary muscular failure and the velocity of a movement across different exercises [72, 73]. Based on this evidence, it has been proposed that practitioners could implement absolute \u2018stopping velocities\u2019 that adjust the amount of volume performed in a given exercise or session [72]. However, at present, there remains limited evidence to support this method of autoregulation as a sustainable form of programming, with the majority of supporting evidence being cross-sectional in nature. Future research is, therefore, required to evaluate the longitudinal application of these approaches and to elucidate the specific measurement and adjustment processes (i.e., to intensity or volume) that are most appropriate for developing different physical qualities such as strength, power, and endurance.\n\n### Meta-session Autoregulation Methods\n\nIn addition to making measurements and adjusting training within a session, an alternative autoregulation practice commonly used is to measure performance at the beginning of a session. This measurement can discern whether any modifications should be made to either specific training variables or the entire training session itself. These methods of autoregulation generally include either a direct measurement of performance, or self-report scales that provide indirect information on an individual\u2019s perception of their performance capability.\n\n#### Performance Measurement with the Countermovement Jump\n\nOne of the most common methods used in practice to measure an individual\u2019s general physical performance is the countermovement jump (CMJ) [74]. CMJ performance can be measured using a broad range of kinematic and kinetic variables [75]; however, the most commonly reported variable is mean vertical jump height across multiple trials [75]. In a comprehensive meta-analysis by Claudino et al. [75], it was reported that consistent measurement of average CMJ height could be appropriately used to monitor changes in general physical performance. Whilst CMJ height has been shown to be a sensitive measure of underlying force and power capabilities on a longitudinal basis (\u2265 3 weeks), it is unclear whether it provides a sensitive measure of performance change across shorter time intervals [76]. It has been reported in multiple studies that individuals may modify their jump strategy during periods of fatigue to maximise jump height despite a reduced capacity to produce force [76\u201379]. Each of these studies calculated jump height via the peak velocity of the centre of mass. However, it is possible that alternative methods of calculating jump height (e.g., time in the air; velocity of an attached load) may further influence the sensitivity of the measurements made [80]. Nevertheless, given the CMJ is accessible, quick to measure and can be performed daily without generating additional fatigue [74], it is a favourable candidate as a performance measurement tool within autoregulation of training [29].\n\nA proposed method of autoregulation using CMJ performance at the meta-session level is through a threshold statistic [29]. Claudino et al. [46] recently investigated the feasibility of a novel method referred to as the minimal individual difference (MID) to autoregulate training volume. The authors recommended that athletes perform a series of eight vertical jumps over 2 days, using the data to calculate the standard deviation of jump heights around their true value. Here, true value refers to the jump height that would be achieved in a hypothetical CMJ test unaffected by measurement error [81, 82]. The standard deviation is then converted into a confidence interval that represents the MID and, therefore, a range of plausible values within which true performance resides [46, 81, 82]. A baseline measure of CMJ height is then established, and at the beginning of each subsequent session, the ability to perform is measured by performing multiple CMJs. If the observed performance and associated interval generated by the MID do not overlap the baseline measurement of performance, then either an increase or decrease in loading can be considered depending on the direction of the performance change [46]. However, practitioners wishing to implement this form of autoregulation may wish to consider the aforementioned sensitivity issues surrounding the use of CMJ height and adjust any monitoring protocols, including the methods used to calculate jump height, or the CMJ variables assessed accordingly [76]. Additionally, the practice may require modification in cases such as overreaching programs where an individual\u2019s performance is expected to decrease substantially over the short to medium term. That is, in a well-designed overreaching program, the structure is designed to induce and manage substantial levels of fatigue. Therefore, to modify the program when the expected levels of fatigue are measured would be counterproductive.\n\n#### Flexible Nonlinear Periodisation\n\nThe FNLP model developed by Kraemer and Fleck [38] provides an alternative method of autoregulation at the meta-session level. With this approach, athletes select from one of many possible training sessions based on either a direct measurement of performance, perceived capability to perform [9], or from a measurement based on other factors such as motivation to train [38]. In general, when performance or perceptions of ability to perform (e.g., high fitness, low fatigue, or high readiness) are elevated, the individual may select more challenging sessions. In contrast, when performance or perceptions thereof are decreased, less-challenging sessions may be selected. In many variants of FNLP, all of the training sessions scheduled are completed over the course of a macro-cycle [38]. Therefore, the purpose of FNLP is often not to change the content of a particular session, but rather to alter the distribution of training to better align with an individual\u2019s underlying performance [17]. Colquhoun et al. [8] investigated the effectiveness of this method in well-trained individuals, enabling those in a volume and intensity matched intervention group to self-select their daily exercise session from either a strength, power, or hypertrophy focused session on a week-by-week basis. No significant differences were identified between the groups across any of the outcomes measured (bench press, squat, and deadlift 1RM).\n\n### The Program Level\n\nThe final level of autoregulation identified in this review is the adjustment of entire programmes or training blocks based on measurement of an individual\u2019s performance. There are presently few such methods that exist; however, we present a potential example using the FFM to demonstrate the creativity that can be used.\n\n#### The Fitness\u2013Fatigue Model as an Autoregulation Tool\n\nIn Sect.\u00a03.1 of this review, the basic FFM was introduced as a means of conceptualising and operationally defining the key constructs of autoregulation. However, it is possible to use one of the many FFM variants as an autoregulation tool in and of itself. Research has demonstrated that with appropriate training data and frequent performance measures an FFM can be fit to an individual by estimating model parameters over a sufficiently long training period [53]. The estimated parameters can be viewed as a holistic performance measurement of the individual. With the basic four parameter FFM, the measurement represents the relative magnitude of fitness and fatigue response to a given stimulus, the recovery rate of fatigue, and the stability of adaptations. With these estimated parameters, a planned training program can be simulated and adjusted if the parameters predict an alternative training program will produce superior results. It would be expected that an athlete or coach would simulate a limited number of potential training programs to inform decision-making [50]; however, research has demonstrated that sophisticated computer algorithms can develop training programs that account for a range of realistic constraints [83, 84]. Irrespective of the particular adjustments made, it is clear that the FFM and predictions could be used in autoregulation on an iterative basis (Fig. 6) where each time the measurement is made, and the FFM fit, the updated parameters provide insight into the changing dynamics of the individual and their response to training. Additionally, research has established that recursive FFMs where parameters are updated based on incoming data can be used to obtain a better model fit [85]. This approach could theoretically lend itself to a dual autoregulation scheme where an entire training block is originally devised, and smaller adjustments are later incorporated as and when required based on an iterative reassessment. This approach remains largely theoretical at present, and future research is required to appraise its effectiveness and feasibility in practice.\n\n## Influence of Measurement Error\n\nAs outlined throughout this review, autoregulation is a two-step feedback process that individualises and adjusts training based on the measurement of performance. However, it is important to consider the various sources of measurement error that may impede the autoregulation process [4]. If adjustments are consistently made using erroneous performance values, it is probable that autoregulation will be less effective than standard practice. As all measurement comprises some degree of error, this feature should be incorporated within various autoregulation practices. For example, when performing VBT, the velocity ranges prescribed should be made wide enough to accommodate for typical error, but not so wide that the training stimulus becomes nonspecific. The technology used to measure velocity (e.g., a force plate or linear position transducer) will likely have to be consistent across sessions and possess suitable validity and reliability. Ensuring these standards will aid practitioners in accurately measuring and isolating \u2018true\u2019 changes in performance [4] and will enhance the reliability of performance estimates over time [67].\n\nMeasurement error will also be an important feature of autoregulation where threshold statistics are used to either terminate a set/session (within session level) or assist with selecting a session to perform (e.g., use of MID at the meta-session level). In the case of terminating a set/session, the individual may choose to terminate only when the velocity falls below the threshold on multiple consecutive instances. This would reduce the chance of measurement error and accompanying biological noise [82] terminating the set/session prematurely. In contrast, measurement error may be more challenging to account for when a threshold statistic is used in autoregulation at the meta-session level. For example, statistics such as that used in MID are based solely on the measurement error associated with a specific test [81, 82]. If the range used is too narrow, then this may lead to well-designed training programs being adjusted too frequently. In contrast, if the range used is too wide, this may lead to true changes in performance that warrant adjustments not being made. To avoid such issues, individuals should ensure that there is correspondence between the magnitude of confidence intervals and the true performance change upon which adjustments to training are considered appropriate.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this review, we have proposed a novel framework derived from the existing theory and models to develop a more systematic conceptualisation of autoregulation. We have suggested that autoregulation can be described as a malleable training framework within which training adjustments are made based predominantly on an individual\u2019s performance, or their subjective assessment thereof. Using an FFM and specifying performance changes as a result of training-related processes (fitness and fatigue) and non-training-related processes (readiness), the proposed framework clarifies key terminologies and concepts that have previously been used ambiguously. This review has also highlighted that contemporary autoregulation practices can be considered across multiple timeframes (within session, meta-session, and across program level) and that adjustments can be made either to acute program variables (intensity and volume) or the distribution of training sessions when changes in an individual\u2019s performance do not match those which are expected.\n\nPerhaps one of the most important take-home points from our review and the framework proposed herein, is that autoregulation is highly context-specific and should be viewed as an adjunct to existing practice, rather than as an alternative or a replacement per se. What is most appropriate may be influenced by a range of factors including the setting, the individual and their goals, the experience of the practitioner, and the resources available. It is hoped that the introduction of a conceptual framework will help in highlighting general features of the autoregulation process that can assist in the synthesis of research findings, even if the specifics of the training programs investigated are different. Whilst the concept of autoregulation of training has been promoted since the 1940s, intensive research efforts have only recently begun. However, for continued development of the area, future research should propose and attempt to establish a range of general principles upon which the effectiveness and feasibility of specific practices can be identified.\n\n## Author contributions\n\nPS conceptualised the work and overarching models.

Learn the format, all 8 stations, time goals, pacing, and a race-day checklist so you can finish strong in 2026.HYROXHYROX raceHYROX beginner\n\nSo, you\u2019ve heard about HYROX and you\u2019re wondering what the hype\u2019s all about. Maybe you saw the videos on TikTok: people running, pushing sleds, throwing wall balls, and thought,\n\n*\u201cThat looks intense... but kind of fun.\u201d* Well, you\u2019re right on both counts.\n\nHYROX is a global fitness race designed for\n\n*everyone*, from everyday gym-goers to seasoned athletes. It blends running and functional workouts in a structured format that tests endurance, strength, and grit, all in one event. Think of it as the perfect bridge between traditional endurance races and high-intensity gym training.\n\nIf you\u2019re new, the setup might sound intimidating at first. Eight 1-kilometer runs. Eight workout stations in between. Thousands of people cheering around you.\n\nBut HYROX is incredibly beginner-friendly. The race is standardized worldwide, so no matter where you compete (New York, Singapore, or Berlin) it\u2019s the same format, same challenge, same community vibe.\n\nIn this beginner\u2019s guide, you\u2019ll learn exactly how HYROX works:\n\n- The race format and station breakdown\n\n- Typical finish times and pacing goals\n\n- A simple 4-week training plan\n\n- Race-day checklists and practical tips\n\nUse this page as your playbook. Skim the station cards for quick technique cues, check the pacing table to set a goal, then follow the starter plan to build confidence week by week. Bookmark it, share it with your training buddy, and come back before race day.\n\nSource: Unsplash\n\n## What is HYROX?\n\nHYROX is a standardized indoor fitness race that combines endurance running with functional workouts. Each race follows the same format worldwide, so every athlete, from first-timers to pros, faces an identical challenge.\n\nThat\u2019s part of what makes HYROX so addictive: you can train, track your progress, and directly compare your performance with thousands of other racers around the globe.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works in simple terms:\n\n- You\u2019ll\n\n**run 1 kilometer**, then complete a **workout station**.\n\n- You\u2019ll repeat that sequence\n\n**eight times**\u2014making it **8 runs + 8 workouts**in total.\n\n- You finish with the infamous\n\n**wall balls**, which test every ounce of energy you\u2019ve got left.\n\nThe workouts focus on real-life movements\u2014pushing, pulling, carrying, rowing\u2014so you don\u2019t need to be a CrossFitter or a marathoner to join in. You just need consistency, basic fitness, and the willingness to challenge yourself.\n\nAnother reason HYROX is growing fast? HYROX is more than a race, it\u2019s an experience. Events are held in massive indoor arenas, with DJ sets, bright lights, and cheering crowds that make it feel more like a sporting festival than a competition. Whether you join solo, with a partner, or in a relay team, the atmosphere is electric and motivating from start to finish.\n\n## Race format at a glance\n\nEvery HYROX event follows the same structure worldwide, no surprises, no hidden twists. That\u2019s part of the magic. You know exactly what\u2019s coming, and you can train specifically for it.\n\nHere\u2019s the simple breakdown:\n\n**Run 1 km \u2192 Workout Station 1 \u2192 Run 1 km \u2192 Workout Station 2 \u2026 all the way to Station 8.**\n\nBy the end, you\u2019ll have covered\n\n**8 kilometers of running** and completed **8 functional workout stations**. The entire race is done indoors, usually in a large convention center, so you don\u2019t have to worry about weather, terrain, or route changes.\n\nEach station tests a different part of your fitness:\n\n**Strength**(sled push and pull) **Power**(wall balls, burpee broad jumps) **Endurance**(row and SkiErg) **Stability and coordination**(farmer\u2019s carry, lunges)\n\nBetween every workout, you\u2019ll return to the\n\n**running track**, your recovery and reset time before the next challenge.\n\nRight in the middle of all this action is the\n\n**Roxzone.**\n\nRoxzine is the transition area connecting your run to the workout stations. Managing this zone efficiently is key to a smooth race. It\u2019s where you\u2019ll catch your breath, pick up equipment, and move between workouts. Think of it as your pit stop: fast, focused, and efficient.\n\nNo matter the location, London, Sydney, or Chicago, the HYROX course layout, order of stations, and distance remain identical. That\u2019s what makes it the first truly global fitness race. Your time in one city can be directly compared to someone racing halfway across the world.\n\nSource: Unsplash\n\n## HYROX categories explained\n\nOne of the coolest things about HYROX is that it\u2019s designed for\n\n*everyone*. You get to pick the level that matches your current fitness and goals. There\u2019s no need to \u201cqualify\u201d for any category, and you can always move up when you\u2019re ready.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick breakdown of the four main HYROX categories:\n\n#### 1. Open\n\nThis is the standard and most popular division for first-timers.\n\n- Moderate weights for sled push/pull, lunges, and wall balls.\n\n- Designed for accessibility, so anyone with a decent fitness base can finish.\n\n- Perfect for your first race or if you\u2019re still working on technique and pacing.\n\n**Goal:** Complete and enjoy the experience while setting your personal benchmark.\n\n#### 2. Pro\n\nThis is where things get heavier and faster.\n\n- The format is the same, but weights increase significantly.\n\n- Usually chosen by experienced athletes, CrossFitters, or competitive racers.\n\n- Expect a tougher challenge, but also the thrill of pushing your limits.\n\n**Goal:** Compete for rankings or improve on your Open time with added resistance.\n\n#### 3. Doubles\n\nRace with a partner and share the work!\n\n- Both teammates run the full 8 km together.\n\n- The workout stations are split however you like using the\n\n**\u201cYou Go, I Go\u201d (YGIG)**rule.\n\n- Great for friends, couples, or training buddies who want to experience HYROX together without the full individual load.\n\n**Goal:** Divide and conquer, teamwork and pacing make all the difference.\n\n#### 4. Relay\n\nIdeal for teams of four.\n\n- Each member completes 2 runs and 2 workout stations before tagging the next teammate.\n\n- It\u2019s fast, loud, and super fun, perfect for groups or corporate challenges.\n\n**Goal:** Go all out in your section and experience the HYROX energy without doing the entire race solo.\n\nSource: Unsplash\n\n## The 8 HYROX workout stations explained\n\nEvery HYROX race features the\n\n**same eight workout stations**, always in the **same order**. This consistency makes training easier because you can prepare for exactly what\u2019s coming. Each station challenges a different aspect of fitness: cardio, strength, power, endurance, and stability.\n\nLet\u2019s break them down one by one:\n\n#### 1. SkiErg (1,000 meters)\n\nThe first station hits your upper body and lungs hard.\n\n**Focus:**Pulling power and rhythm. **Tip:**Keep strokes long and controlled, don\u2019t sprint too early. **Common mistake:**Hunching over or using only your arms instead of driving from the hips.\n\n#### 2. Sled Push (50 meters)\n\nA full-body power test that hits your legs and core.\n\n**Focus:**Strong drive through your quads and glutes. **Tip:**Keep a low body angle, short steps, and constant tension. **Common mistake:**Pushing with just your arms or standing too upright, which kills momentum.\n\n#### 3. Sled Pull (50 meters)\n\nNow the pull to balance out the push.\n\n**Focus:**Grip strength and posterior chain. **Tip:**Use a hand-over-hand motion, lean back slightly, and walk backward steadily. **Common mistake:**Jerky pulls that waste ener, smooth is fast here.\n\n#### 4. Burpee Broad Jumps (80 meters)\n\nIt\u2019s as brutal as it sounds, but pacing is key.\n\n**Focus:**Explosiveness and endurance. **Tip:**Land softly, keep jumps consistent, and rest in the standing position if you need to catch your breath. **Common mistake:**Jumping too far and burning out early.\n\n#### 5. Row (1,000 meters)\n\nA cardio reset that still taxes your legs and core.\n\n**Focus:**Efficient stroke rhythm, don\u2019t rush it. **Tip:**Drive with your legs first, then hinge back, then pull with your arms. **Common mistake:**Over-pulling or neglecting leg drive.\n\n#### 6. Farmer\u2019s Carry (200 meters)\n\nSimple but deceiving. Grip and core control are everything.\n\n**Focus:**Stability and breathing under load. **Tip:**Keep shoulders back, walk tall, and take measured steps. **Common mistake:**Leaning or swinging weights, which drains your grip faster.\n\n#### 7. Sandbag Lunges (100 meters)\n\nYour legs will hate you here, but it\u2019s almost the end.\n\n**Focus:**Balance, endurance, and leg power. **Tip:**Keep your core tight and knees at 90 degrees with every step. **Common mistake:**Short steps or skipping the knee touch, can cost penalties.\n\n#### 8. Wall Balls (75 reps for men / 50 for women)\n\nThe grand finale, your heart rate spikes, but the crowd carries you through.\n\n**Focus:**Coordination and consistent breathing. **Tip:**Stay calm, use leg power, and aim for smooth sets of 10\u201315 reps. **Common mistake:**Dropping the ball too often, small, steady sets beat big burnout sets.\n\nSource: Unsplash\n\n## How long does HYROX take?\n\nOne of the most common questions beginners ask is:\n\n*\u201cHow long will it take me to finish HYROX?\u201d*\n\nThe short answer, somewhere between\n\n**60 and 120 minutes**, depending on your fitness level, pacing, and category.\n\nBut let\u2019s break it down a little more clearly.\n\n#### Average finishing times\n\n**Elite athletes (Pro Men/Women):**55\u201375 minutes **Intermediate athletes (Open):**80\u2013100 minutes **First-timers:**100\u2013120 minutes\n\nRemember: there\u2019s no time limit. You can take as long as you need to finish, and the crowd will still cheer just as loud when you cross that line. HYROX is about personal challenge, not just competition.\n\n#### Typical time breakdown\n\n#### \u201cGood\u201d benchmark goals\n\nIf you\u2019re training for your first HYROX and want a rough benchmark:\n\n**Under 100 mins:**Strong first-timer, well-balanced fitness. **Around 110 mins:**Solid finish with steady pacing. **Under 90 mins:**You\u2019ve officially caught the HYROX bug, and trained well!\n\n#### Pacing strategy\n\nThe biggest mistake beginners make? Starting too fast.\n\nThat first 1 km run feels easy, but it\u2019s a trap. Aim to finish your first two runs feeling like you could go faster, not gasping for air. That controlled start will help you maintain energy for the final three stations, where most people hit the wall.\n\n**Tip:** Treat the run segments as active recovery. Slow down slightly between heavy stations, regulate your breathing, and save your push for the final two kilometers.\n\n## Race-day checklist\n\nDial in the simple stuff so you can focus on moving well. Use this list the night before.\n\n#### Must-bring items\n\n- Photo ID, registration QR, waiver\n\n- Race wristband if collected at packet pick-up\n\n- Shoes with good indoor grip, spare laces\n\n- Socks (bring a backup pair)\n\n- Outfit: top, shorts/tights, sports bra (for women)\n\n- Anti-chafe stick, tape for hot spots\n\n- Small towel\n\n- Electrolytes, bottle, light carbs (bananas, gels, chews)\n\n- Post-race snack, recovery drink\n\n- Cash/card for venue food and merch\n\n#### Nice-to-have gear\n\n- Knee sleeves for lunges\n\n- Thin gloves for sled pull rope\n\n- Wrist strap for timing chip if provided\n\n- Portable massage ball or mini band\n\n#### What to wear\n\n- Lightweight, breathable layers\n\n- Secure pockets or race belt for gels\n\n- Shoes with stable midsole and good forefoot traction\n\n#### Warm-up (10\u201315 minutes)\n\n- Easy jog or brisk walk 5 minutes\n\n- Mobility: hips, calves, thoracic spine\n\n- Activation: bodyweight squats, lunges, plank 30 seconds\n\n- Two short strides or SkiErg/rower pickups at comfortable effort\n\n#### Pre-start fueling\n\n- Night before: normal dinner with extra carbs and water\n\n- 2\u20133 hours before: simple carb-heavy meal you trust\n\n- 15\u201320 minutes before: sip electrolytes, optional small carb bite\n\n#### Timing at the venue\n\n- Arrive 60\u201390 minutes before your wave\n\n- Bag drop and restroom first\n\n- Walk the Roxzone entry and exit paths\n\n- Locate start pen early\n\n#### Roxzone habits that save minutes\n\n- Keep moving with small steps, breathe through the nose on entry\n\n- Set equipment once, avoid re-adjusting mid-station\n\n- Exit decisively, settle into run pace in the first 50\u2013100 meters\n\n#### Mental checklist before the gun\n\n- First 2 km controlled pace\n\n- Smooth reps over big sets\n\n- Sip fluids between stations as needed\n\n- One cue per station: posture, breath, rhythm\n\nPack it all the night before, lay out your outfit, and set two alarms. Calm morning, clean execution.\n\n## How to pace your first HYROX\n\nPacing can make or break your HYROX race. Go out too fast, and you\u2019ll hit the wall by station three. Go too slow, and you\u2019ll finish with too much left in the tank. The key is finding that middle ground: steady, controlled effort from start to finish.\n\n#### 1. Start slower than you think\n\nThe first 1 km run always feels easy, especially with adrenaline and music pumping. But don\u2019t get carried away. Keep your effort around\n\n**70\u201375%** of what feels \u201chard.\u201d You should be breathing steadily, not gasping. Remember, you\u2019ve got eight rounds to go.\n\n#### 2. Use the runs as active recovery\n\nHYROX isn\u2019t eight sprints, it\u2019s a rhythm race. The running sections are your chance to bring your heart rate down between stations. Use shorter, efficient strides and relax your shoulders. Think of it as your reset before the next big effort.\n\n#### 3. Control your transitions\n\nThe\n\n**Roxzone** (your transition area) is where many athletes lose time. Don\u2019t stop to rest here. Slow down your walk, grab your equipment smoothly, and start the movement. Aim for **no more than 10\u201315 seconds** between run and station.\n\n#### 4. Station strategy\n\nEach workout station has its own pacing trick:\n\n**SkiErg / Row:**Keep strokes smooth and steady. Save power for the finish. **Sled Push / Pull:**Use short bursts, then rest 3\u20135 seconds instead of grinding nonstop. **Burpees / Wall Balls:**Break reps into manageable sets early\u201410s or 15s\u2014and stick to your plan. **Farmer\u2019s Carry / Lunges:**Focus on posture and breathing; these stations are about control, not speed.\n\n#### 5. Negative split your race\n\nIf you can, aim to finish stronger than you started. That means holding back in the first half and gradually increasing pace from station five onward. It\u2019s far more rewarding to overtake people later than to get passed in the final stretch.\n\n#### 6. Watch the clock, but don\u2019t chase it\n\nUse your watch or on-site timer to stay aware of your total time, but don\u2019t obsess. HYROX is about rhythm and flow. Stick to your strategy, manage your energy, and you\u2019ll likely finish faster than expected.\n\n## Common rookie mistakes (and how to fix them)\n\nEvery HYROX athlete makes mistakes at their first race, it\u2019s practically a rite of passage. But the good news? Most of them are easy to avoid once you know what to look out for. Here are the most common slip-ups beginners make and how to fix them fast.\n\n#### 1. Starting too fast\n\n**The mistake:** Sprinting the first run like it\u2019s a 5K.\n\n**The fix:** Treat the first 2 km as a warm-up. Keep your breathing under control and aim for a pace you can maintain for 90+ minutes. You\u2019ll thank yourself later.\n\n#### 2. Ignoring transitions\n\n**The mistake:** Standing still between runs and stations to \u201ccatch your breath.\u201d\n\n**The fix:** Keep moving. Slow your walk, focus on deep breathing, and start the next movement before your mind talks you out of it. Time disappears quickly in the Roxzone.\n\n#### 3. Poor sled technique\n\n**The mistake:** Standing upright and pushing with arms only, or jerking the rope on the pull.\n\n**The fix:** Stay low, drive from your legs, and maintain constant pressure on the push. On the pull, use a smooth hand-over-hand motion while leaning slightly back.\n\n#### 4. Skipping recovery and hydration\n\n**The mistake:** Not drinking enough or relying solely on adrenaline.\n\n**The fix:** Sip electrolytes before and during the event. A small carb snack 30\u201345 minutes before your heat keeps energy steady through the later stations.\n\n#### 5. Overestimating wall balls\n\n**The mistake:** Trying to hit all 75 (or 50) reps unbroken.\n\n**The fix:** Break early and strategically. Sets of 10\u201315 reps with short pauses keep your form clean and prevent burnout. Smooth and steady wins here.\n\n#### 6. Wearing the wrong shoes\n\n**The mistake:** Showing up in thick-soled running shoes with no grip.\n\n**The fix:** Choose a stable, low-profile trainer with good traction on indoor flooring. Slipping on sleds or lunges can cost time and confidence.\n\n#### 7. Neglecting strength in training\n\n**The mistake:** Only running to prepare for HYROX.\n\n**The fix:** Mix in functional strength days: lunges, sled pushes, carries. The race rewards balanced conditioning, not just cardio.\n\n#### 8. Forgetting to enjoy it\n\n**The mistake:** Treating HYROX like a punishment instead of an event.\n\n**The fix:** Look up, smile, and soak in the energy. The crowd, music, and community vibe are part of the reason people keep coming back.\n\n## Gear that actually helps\n\nYou don\u2019t need fancy gear to crush your first HYROX, but a few smart choices can make the experience way smoother (and save you from painful blisters or wasted energy).\n\nHere\u2019s what really matters:\n\n#### 1. Shoes: Grip over gimmicks\n\nYour shoes can make or break your sled stations. You\u2019ll be on polished indoor floors, not outdoor tracks, so\n\n**traction and stability** are everything.\n\n\u2705 Look for flat, firm soles with good grip.\n\n\u2705 Avoid squishy running shoes, they absorb force instead of transferring it.\n\n\u2705 Training shoes like cross-trainers or hybrid running/strength models usually perform best.\n\n**Tip:** Try your shoes on wet or smooth flooring before race day. If you slip while pushing a sled, it\u2019ll cost time and energy.\n\n#### 2. Gloves: Optional but useful\n\nSome athletes swear by gloves for the sled pull and farmer\u2019s carry, others hate them.\n\n- Use\n\n**thin grip gloves**or chalk if you tend to get sweaty hands.\n\n- Skip thick gloves, they\u2019ll make gripping the rope harder.\n\n- Test them during training so there are no surprises on race day.\n\n#### 3. Knee sleeves or pads\n\nLunges and burpees can get tough on hard floors. A light pair of\n\n**neoprene knee sleeves** adds support and protects from bruising.\n\n- Choose flexible, breathable sleeves, not powerlifting-style thick ones.\n\n- Bonus: they keep your knees warm, helping mobility early in the race.\n\n#### 4. Apparel\n\nYou\u2019ll sweat, a lot, so pick\n\n**moisture-wicking fabrics**.\n\n- Tank or fitted top: avoids fabric snagging on sleds.\n\n- Compression shorts or leggings: reduce chafing and keep things secure.\n\n- Sports bra with strong support (for women).\n\n- Avoid cotton, it gets heavy and stays wet.\n\n#### 5. Accessories\n\n**Timing chip strap:**make sure it\u2019s secure before the start. **Small towel:**for quick wipes in transition areas. **Lightweight belt or pocket:**to hold gels or small fuel if needed. **Water bottle or electrolyte pack:**optional if the venue provides hydration zones, but always good to have.\n\n## Gear that actually helps\n\nBefore you step onto the starting line, it helps to know the key terms you\u2019ll hear tossed around at HYROX events and in training videos. Here\u2019s a quick glossary to get you sounding (and feeling) like a pro:\n\n#### 1. Roxzone\n\nThe central transition area that connects your runs to each workout station. You\u2019ll enter and exit the Roxzone eight times during the race. Smooth transitions here can shave off minutes from your total time.\n\n#### 2. YGIG (You Go, I Go)\n\nThe rule used in\n\n*Doubles* races. One partner works while the other rests, and you can switch anytime. The strategy is to divide the work efficiently and communicate clearly.\n\n#### 3. Open\n\nThe standard HYROX category designed for most participants. Weights and distances are balanced for accessibility, making it perfect for first-timers.\n\n#### 4. Pro\n\nThe advanced division featuring heavier weights and faster pacing. Usually chosen by experienced or competitive athletes aiming for top rankings.\n\n#### 5. Doubles\n\nA two-person race where both partners run every kilometer together but split the workout stations under the YGIG rule. Great for couples, training buddies, or anyone who wants to share the load.\n\n#### 6. Relay\n\nA four-person team format. Each athlete completes two runs and two workout stations before tagging the next teammate. It\u2019s fast, fun, and loud, ideal for groups or corporate teams.\n\n#### 7. Wall Balls\n\nThe final station of every HYROX. You\u2019ll squat with a medicine ball and throw it to a target on the wall\u201475 reps for men, 50 for women. It\u2019s a mental battle as much as a physical one.\n\n#### 8. SkiErg / RowErg\n\nThe cardio machines used in two of the eight stations. Both mimic endurance movements\u2014skiing and rowing\u2014that test upper-body stamina and coordination.\n\n#### 9. Functional Fitness\n\nThe core principle of HYROX. It means exercises that mimic real-life movements (pushing, pulling, carrying, and lunging) to build practical, usable strength.\n\n#### 10. Transition Time\n\nThe seconds between finishing a run and starting the next workout. Efficient transitions can save up to 3\u20135 minutes over the course of a race.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far, you\u2019re already halfway to the start line. HYROX might look intimidating from the outside, but once you understand the format and break your training into simple, consistent steps, it becomes something incredible, a challenge that\u2019s equal parts physical grind and community celebration.\n\nYour first race isn\u2019t about speed or rankings; it\u2019s about finishing strong and learning how your body responds under pressure.

          "snippet": "Recommendations for safe return to sport include clearance of infection allowing full recovery and thereafter gradual progress of exercise volume combined with monitoring of remaining symptoms of illness. Different actions can be taken to prevent acquiring, aggravating and spreading of infections by the athlete (e.g. hygiene, physical contact, covering of the body, sharing of equipment, nutrition), the coaches (e.g. individualised plan of training, competition, nutrition, recovery and recovery measures) and the physicians (monitor and implement illness prevention, identify and arrange for high-risk athletes, educate athletes and staff).\n\n\u2026\n\n- Firstly, and most importantly, return to play should occur only after the infection has cleared. This means that the athlete should have no remaining muscle pain, general malaise, fever or specific symptoms of the disease (diarrhoea, etc.).\n- Secondly, RTP is a gradual process. The athlete should be closely monitored and only be allowed to increase training load if he/she is symptom-free. The length of this adjustment period is dependent on the duration and severity of the infection.\n\n\u2026\n\nWhen the athlete returns from an illness (return to play), exercise should be resumed in successive manner, always considering any symptoms. Special considerations are required for a few conditions. Firstly, no exercise should be allowed when the athlete has gastroenteritis. Secondly, when an athlete has infectious mononucleosis, non-contact sport should only be considered after 3 weeks at the earliest.",

In order to reduce the risk of injury and illness the National Strength and Conditioning Association and Collegiate Strength and Conditioning Association put out a joint guidelines to follow the 50/30/20/10 rule and FIT (frequency, intensity volume, and time of rest intervals) rule in order to guide a gradual return to activity in a way that reduces the risk of injury and illness.\n\nThe guidelines are a maximum recommended dosage for the transition process and the training load can also be reduced even less than the guidelines suggest.\n\n\u2026\n\n## The 50/30/20/10 Rule\n\nThe 50/30/20/10 rule recommends that training increases in intensity over a four-week period.\n\n- Week 1: 50% workload from what was done previously.\n\n- Week 2: 30% from the previous workload\n\n- Week 3: 20% of previous workload\n\n- Week 4: 10% of previous workload.\n\nThis rule can further help to guide specific components of a training such as the dosage of the specific workout as well as strength and conditioning testing which will help to guide the training program.",

This is true for rest, exercise and ambulatory HRV clinical ECG device recordings in prospective cohorts. Recently, there has been a rapid increase in the use of mobile health technologies (mHealth) and commercial wearable fitness devices. Most of these devices use ECG or photo-based plethysmography and both are validated for providing accurate heart rate measurements. This offers the opportunity to make risk information from HRV more widely available. The physiology of HRV and the available technology by which it can be assessed has been summarised in Part 1 of this review. In Part 2 the association between HRV and risk stratification is addressed by reviewing the current evidence from data acquired by resting ECG, exercise ECG and medical ambulatory devices. This is followed by a discussion of the use of HRV to guide the training of athletes and as a part of fitness programmes.\n\n**Keywords:** Heart rate variability, exercise, athletic training, mobile health technologies, prognosis, athletic performance\n\n## Estimation of Prognosis Using HRV\n\nThe association of heart rate variability (HRV) and prognosis, both for all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality, has been studied using ECG at rest, with exercise and in the ambulatory setting. A meta-analysis by Hillebrand and colleagues found that, using both resting and ambulatory ECG monitoring, lower HRV is associated with a 32\u201345 % increased risk of first CV event in patients without known CV disease.[1] Additionally, elevated HRV demonstrates a protective effect, with an increase in standard deviation of the normalised NN interval (SDNN) of 1 % resulting in an approximate 1 % reduction of fatal or non-fatal CV disease event.\n\n### Resting ECG for HRV Prognosis\n\nThe Zutphen study assessed HRV obtained from resting ECGs in 878 men aged 50\u201365 years, referred to as the middle-aged cohort, who were followed up 15 years later.[2] Participants from the original population and new patients formed a group of 885 patients, referred to as the elderly cohort. Using resting 15\u201330 seconds of 12-lead ECG data to calculate SDNN, the investigators found increased rates of coronary heart disease mortality (RR 2.1, 95 % CI [1.1\u20134.1]) and all-cause mortality (RR 2.1, 95 % CI [1.4\u20133.0]) among patients with HRV <20 ms (compared with 21\u201339 ms) in the middle-aged cohort at 5-year follow-up. No significant change in mortality was noted in patients with the highest HRV (\u226540 ms). No association with mortality was found in the elderly cohort.\n\nThe Rotterdam study enrolled 5,272 patients aged 55 years (mean = 69 \u00b1 9) and acquired 10-second rest 12-lead ECGs.[3] SDNN values were put into quartiles with the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles corresponding to values of 9.6 ms, 15.2 ms, and 25.9 ms, respectively. The investigators found that patients in the lowest quartile had an 80 % increase (HR 1.80, 95 % CI [1.0\u20133.2]) for cardiac mortality compared with patients in the third quartile after adjustments for age and sex. Patients in the highest quartile had the most pronounced adjusted risk for cardiac mortality (HR 2.3, 1.3\u20134.0), suggesting that low or high SDNN can be associated with mortality in an older population.\n\nThe Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities (ARIC) study used a case-cohort method of analysing 900 patients without CAD and using 2-minute ECGs, SDNN, root mean square of the differences in successive R-R intervals (RMSSD), and percentage of R-R intervals that differ by 50 ms (pNN50).[4] Demographic-adjusted survival analysis showed increased RR of all-cause death and incident coronary artery disease in the lowest tertile compared with intermediate and highest tertiles for all variables. RR of mortality for SDNN in the lowest tertile (<30 ms) was 2.10 compared with the intermediate group.\n\nYoo and colleagues compared HRV with the Framingham Risk Score to determine if HRV values could serve as an acceptable substitute for a CHD risk assessment.[5] The study involved 85 adults using resting ECG measurements in the seated position taken after 20 minutes of rest. Patients with Framingham risk >10 % were found to have significantly depressed SDNN, RMSSD, and in high-frequency (HF) values. These signals, however, appeared to be isolated to men and there was no statistically significant relationship between Framingham risk score and HRV among women in this small cohort.\n\n#### Table 1: Nomenclature for Common Heart Rate Variability Measurements.\n\n|Abbreviation|Units|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|SDNN|ms|Standard deviation of NN intervals|\n|SDRR|ms|Standard deviation of RR intervals|\n|pNN50|%|Percentage of successive RR intervals that differ by more than 50 ms|\n|RMSSD|ms|Root mean square of successive RR interval differences|\n|HF|ms^2^/Hz/nu|High-frequency power|\n|LF|ms^2^/Hz/nu|Low-frequency power|\n\nThese findings extend to cohorts with established CV disease. Studying only patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, La Rovere and colleagues found reductions in HRV to be predictive of sudden death.[6] A resting ECG of 8 minutes\u2019 duration was obtained with spontaneous respiration, as well as a controlled breathing period. Patients with dilated cardiomyopathy were found to have reductions in low frequency (LF) power with spontaneous (30 ms[2] versus 45 ms[2], p=0.01) and controlled-breathing (28 ms[2] versus 41 ms[2], p=0.02). Reduced LF power during controlled breathing was found to be predictive of sudden death during a 3-year follow-up period (RR 2.8, 95% CI [1.2\u20136.8]), independent of left ventricular dimensions.\n\nResting HRV measurements have been used to link enhanced sympathetic autonomic nervous system (SANS) activity with myocardial destabilisation and arrhythmogenic potential. HRV, however, serves as an indirect measurement of SANS, given its action on baroreceptors and the sinoatrial node. Periodic repolarisation dynamics (PRD), which can be obtained by focusing on low-frequency patterns of resting 3D ECGs, may serve as a more direct measurement.[7] Factors that lead to heterogeneous sympathetic activation, such as previous MI, diabetes, and inherited channelopathies, are all associated with greater PRD at rest. Previous studies have shown resting PRD to predict post-MI mortality independent of established risk factors such as left ventricular ejection fraction, the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score, increased QT-variability index, and reduced HRV.[8] Current studies are ongoing to better understand the role of PRD in identifying patients for prophylactic ICD placement.\n\n### Ambulatory ECG for HRV Prognosis\n\nWhile the ECG is the established gold standard for cardiac monitoring, technological advances have allowed for commercial products to be developed to allow for out-of-hospital monitoring. Both ECG and photo-based plethysmography have been validated as accurate measures of HR, and commercial products using these methods of detection have allowed for accurate and prolonged detection of arrhythmias such as AF.[9] With increasing evidence for HRV as a prognostic tool, there have been attempts to validate these home-based technologies for HRV as well.\n\nStudying patients from the original Framingham study, Tsuji et al found an increased risk of all-cause mortality in patients with depressed HRV.[10] Using 2-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring, the investigators considered 736 patients from the original Framingham study. They found that, with adjustment for age, sex, and clinical risk factors, patients 1 SD below the mean for SD of NN intervals (SDNN), LF, very LF (VLF), HF and total power all had increased risks of all-cause mortality over 4 years. SDNN was the only time-domain factor with elevated risk after adjustment (HR 1.38, 95 % CI [1.13\u20131.70], p=0.019). Decreased values of LF were associated with highest adjusted risk (1.70, 95 % CI [1.37\u20132.09], p=0.001) of all HRV parameters. Additionally, a study combining patients from the original Framingham study and the Framingham Offspring Study (n=2,501, average age 53 years), demonstrated that with 2-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring, patients with lower SDNN had significantly higher rates of heart disease (12.40 versus 2.06).[11]\n\nA long-term prospective study by Kikuya reported results from ambulatory BP data obtained from 1,542 subjects (mean 62 years, 40 % male) in Japan.[12] BP and HR measurements were taken every 30 minutes using an ambulatory cuff-oscillometric device, as the patients went about their normal day and night routines. Patients were divided by SDNN into three groups (mean - SD, mean \u00b1 SD, mean + SD) for analysis. A significant inverse linear relationship was noted for daytime HRV and cardiovascular death (p=0.008) during the mean follow-up period of 8.5 years, even after adjustment for use of beta blockers. The lowest HRV tertile was found to have HR of 3.64 (p=0.02). Changes in night-time HRV did not show a similar risk of CV death.\n\nThe Autonomic Tone and Reflexes After MI (ATRAMI) study considered the prognostic value of SDNN in 1,284 patients with recent MI.[13] Patients with MI within the previous 28 days were enrolled in the study and followed with ambulatory Holter monitoring for SDNN analysis. Baroreflex sensitivity was also assessed by measuring rate-pressure response to. infusion of phenylephrine. Multivariate analysis showed that patients with SDNN <70 ms or baroreflex sensitivity <3 ms/mmHg showed increased risk of cardiac mortality. In patients with depression of both parameters, 2-year mortality was 17 % compared with 2 % in patients where the parameters had remained stable. Klieger et al. demonstrated similar post-MI results,with a RR of mortality of 5.3 in post-MI patients with SDNN <50ms compared with those that had >100 ms.[14] The Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell\u2019Infarto Miocardico (GISSI-2) study analysed the usefulness of HRV in patients who had a recent MI that had been treated with fibrinolytic therapy.[15] Of 567 patients, 7.8 % died of cardiovascular causes during 1,000 days of follow-up. HRV parameters exhibited elevated RR for SDNN (RR 3.0), RMSSD (RR 2.8) and NN50 (RR 3.5).\n\nWhile often used to predict mortality, a review by Reed et al looked at HRV as a predictor of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTA).[16] Vybrial et al showed no consistent changes in HRV indices in 24 patients who wore Holter monitors and developed ventricular fibrillation.[17] Huikuri et al, however, found significant reductions in HR and HRV indices (SDANN, HF, LF) in post-MI patients who developed ventricular tachycardia compared with those without arrhythmic events.[18] These changes occurred in the 1-hour period preceding VTA, and the degree of reduction was more pronounced in patients with sustained arrhythmias. Shusterman et al demonstrated that the presence of a change in HRV alone,[19] within a 2-hour period before arrhythmic events, could predict the development of VTAs.[20]\n\n#### Table 2: Mortality Risk Associated with Various Heart Rate Variability Measurements Using Resting ECG.\n\n|Study|Number of Patients|Monitoring Method|HRV Parameters|Conclusions|\n|--|--|--|--|--|\n|Zutphen study Dekker et al. 1997[2]|878 (middle-aged cohort) 885 (elderly cohort)|Resting ECG, 15\u201330 sec|SDNN|SDNN <20 ms associated with increased risk of CHD (RR 2.1, 95 % CI [1.1\u20134.1]) and all-cause mortality (RR 2.1, 95 % CI [1.4\u20133.0])|\n|Rotterdam study De Bruyne et al. 1999[3]|5,272|Resting ECG, 10 sec|SDNN|SDNN in lowest and highest quartiles had increased risk of cardiac mortality; HR 1.8 (95 % CI [1.0\u20132.3]) and 2.3 (95 % CI [1.3\u20134.0]) respectively|\n|ARIC study Dekker et al. 2000[4]|900|Resting ECG, 2 min|SDNN, rMSSD, SDSD, pNN50|Increased risk of all-cause mortality for patients in the lowest tertile of all parameters (RR 1.47\u20131.91)|\n|Yoo et al. 2011[5]|85|Resting ECG|SDNN, rMSSD, VLF, LF, HF, LF/HF, TP|SDNN (28ms versus 36ms, p=0.037), rMSSD (28ms versus 29ms, p=0.007), and lnHF (4.7ms^2^ versus 5.5ms^2^, p=0.008) are depressed in patients with FRS >10 %|\n|La Rovere et al. 2003[6]|444|Resting ECG, 8 min|SDNN, LF and HF|Increased risk of sudden death with reduced LFP (RR 2.8, 95 % CI [1.2\u20136.8], p=0.02)|\n\nFRS = Framingham risk score; HF = high frequency power; HRV = heart rate variability; LF = low frequency power; LF/HF = low frequency to high frequency power ratio; ln HF = natural log of the high-frequency measurement; pNN50 = percentage of RR intervals that differ by 50ms; rMSSD = root mean square of the differences in successive R-R intervals; SDNN = standard deviation of NN intervals; SDSD = standard deviation of absolute differences between successive intervals; TP = total power; VLF = very low frequency power.\n\n#### Table 3: Mortality Risk Associated with Various Heart Rate Variability Measurements Using Ambulatory ECG.\n\n|Study Name|Number of Patients|Monitoring Method|HRV parameters|Conclusions|\n|--|--|--|--|--|\n|Tsuji et al. 1994[10] (Framingham)|736|2-hour ambulatory ECG|VLFP, LFP, HFP, LFP/HFP, TP, SDNN, rMSSD, pNN50+|lnLF <1 SD from mean had increased all-cause mortality (HR 1.70, 95 % CI [1.37\u20132.09])|\n|Tsuji et al. 1996[11] (Framingham Offspring)|2,501|2-hour ambulatory ECG|VLFP, LFP, HFP, LFP/HFP, TP, SDNN, rMSSD, pNN50+|All HRV parameters except LFP/HFP associated with increased risk of cardiac events (p=0.016\u20130.0496); adjusted HR for lnSDNN <1 SD from mean 1.45 (95 % CI [1.13\u20131.85], p=0.003)|\n|Kikuya et al. 2000[12]|1,542|Ambulatory blood pressure monitor|SDNN|Patients in lowest tertile have increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 3.70, p=0.003)|\n|La Rovere et al. 1998[13] ATRAMI trial|1,284|24-hour Holter monitor|SDNN|SDNN <70 ms had increased risk of CV-related death (RR 5.3, 95 % CI [2.49\u201311.4], p<0.0001) compared to >105 ms|\n|Klieger et al. 1987[14]|808|24-hour Holter monitor|SDNN|SDNN <50ms had increased risk of all-cause mortality compared with >100 ms (34 % versus 9 %, p <0.0001, RR 5.3)|\n|Zuanetti et al. 1996[15] GISSI-2 trial|567|24-hour Holter monitor|SDNN, rMSSD, NN50+|Risk of all-cause mortality elevated for NN50+ <200, SDNN <70 ms, or rMSSD <17.5 ms (RR 2.8\u20133.5)|\n|Adamson et al. 2004[18]|288|CRT-P|SDAAM|Elevated risk of all-cause mortality for SDAAM < 50 ms (HR 3.20, p=0.02)|\n|Sherazi et al. 2015[19] MADIT-CRT trial|719|CRT-D|SDNN, SDANN, SDNNIX, rMSSD, VLF, LF, HF, LF/HF|SDNN <93ms associated with increased all-cause mortality (HR 2.10, 95 % CI [1.14\u20133.87], p=0.017)|\n|Nolan et al. 1998[17] UK-Heart trial|433|24-hour Holter monitor|SDNN, rMSSD, sNN50|SDNN <93ms has all-cause mortality RR 1.62 (95 % CI [1.16\u20132.44])|\n\nCRT-D = cardiac resynchronisation therapy defibrillator; CRT-P = cardiac resynchronisation therapy pacemaker; HF = high frequency power; HRV = heart rate variability; LF = low frequency power; LF/HF = low frequency to high frequency power ratio; ln HF = natural log of the high-frequency measurement; pNN50 = percentage of RR intervals that differ by 50ms; rMSSD = root mean square of the differences in successive R-R intervals; SD = standard deviation; SDAAM = SD of 5 min median A-A intervals; SDANN = SD of 5 min R-R intervals; SDNN = standard deviation of NN intervals; SDNNIX = mean SD of all R-R intervals; TP = total power; VLF = very low frequency power.\n\nFocusing on patients with an ejection fraction lower than 35%, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV, and QRS duration >130 ms, Adamson and colleagues sought to assess the feasibility of implantable cardiac resynchronisation devices for prognostic purposes in an ambulatory setting.[21] Using atrial intervals, HRV was defined as the standard deviation of median 5-minute a-a intervals over each 24-hour period (SDAAM). They found that the patients with the lowest SDAAM (<50 ms) had the highest all-cause mortality (HR 3.2, p=0.02) and CV-related death (HR 4.4, p=0.01) compared with higher SDAAM values over a 12-month follow-up period. Additionally, absolute SDAAM values were lower in the inpatients who were included in the study.\n\nThe Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial-Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (MADIT-CRT) trial followed patients with ejection fraction lower than 30 %, QRS duration >130 ms, and non-ischaemic heart failure with NYHA functional class I or II, randomising them to either cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT-D) or ICD alone.[22] In a retrospective analysis of these patients, Sharazi et al found that patients in the lowest tertile of SDNN (\u226493 ms) had higher rates of death or heart failure (24 % versus 17 %, p=0.004).[22] Similar outcomes were shown using frequency domain measures such as VLF (28 % versus 14 %, p<0.001). The overall results agreed with the UK Heart Failure Evaluation and Assessment of Risk Trial (UK-Heart) trial, which showed increased risk of death in patients with heart failure and depressed SDNN values.[20] In their sub-study analysis, the MADIT-CRT investigators concluded that ambulatory HRV analysis in heart failure patients may identify patients who would most benefit from CRT; low HRV showed no benefit with CRT-D versus ICD alone, while patients with preserved HRV treated with CRT-D had a lower risk of death. It appears that not only can HRV be used to assess the risk of death and hospitalisation in patients with heart failure, but it may also be used to determine candidates for CRT-D therapy.\n\n### Exercise HRV and Prognosis\n\nIn the first study of exercise, HRV and prognosis, Dewey and colleagues performed time and frequency-domain HRV analysis on R-R interval data taken from 1,335 subjects (95% male; mean age 58 years) during the first and last 2 minutes of treadmill testing and the first 2 minutes of recovery.[23] Cox survival analysis was performed for the 53 cardiovascular and 133 all-cause deaths that accrued during the 5-year mean follow-up. After adjusting for potential confounders, greater root mean square successive difference in R-R interval during peak exercise and recovery, greater HF power and percentage of HF power, lower percentage of LF power, and lower ratio of LF to HF during recovery were significantly associated with increased risks for all-cause and CV death. Of all time-domain variables considered, the log of the root mean square successive difference during recovery was the strongest predictor of CV mortality (adjusted HR 5.0, 95 % CI [1.5\u201317.0]) for the top quintile compared with the lowest quintile). Log HF power during recovery was the strongest predictor of CV mortality in the frequency domain (adjusted HR 5.9, 95 % CI [1.3\u201325.8], for the top quintile compared with the lowest quintile). They concluded that exercise-induced HRV variables during and after clinical exercise testing strongly predict both CV and all-cause mortality independent of clinical factors and exercise responses in a clinical population.\n\nDespite the strong association found in the study by Dewey et al., other investigators, such as Nieminen et al., have argued that these findings may be predominantly driven by heart rate alone.[23,24] As HRV is associated with HR physiologically (autonomic system) and mathematically (R-R interval), further consideration of this relationship is required to integrate these variables in risk stratification. Pradhapan and colleagues explored this by assessing the effect of HR correction on pre- and post-exercise HRV.[25] They selected 1,288 patients from the Finnish Cardiovascular Study cohort. Inclusion criteria included completing a maximum effort exercise test and good quality HRV measurement for at least 2 minutes during rest, immediately before exercise and during post-exercise recovery. All participants were followed for cardiac and non-cardiac mortality for a mean time of 54 months. The investigators concluded that exercise-induced HRV parameters (RMSSD, VLF power, LF power, p<0.001 pre- and post-exercise) strongly predict cardiac morality with similar but weaker association found for non-cardiac mortality. Consistent with contemporary data presented by Sacha et al, they showed that when predicting both cardiac and non-cardiac morality, weakening HRV dependence on HR at rest improved prognostic capacity.[26] Future studies are required to quantify the clinical significance of HRV recorded during exercise with a different HR and respiratory rate.\n\n## Rest and Exercise HRV for Training\n\nThe use of HRV as a tool to track and monitor the status of athletes has gained much interest over recent years.[27] The desire to be the best often pushes the athlete to the fine line between the maximisation of effective training (achieved by duration, frequency and intensity) and ineffective training (e.g. maladaptation, non-functional overreaching and overtraining).[28] Given the fact that adaptive responses to a training load or stimulus are individual,[29\u201331] it is understandable that the ability to independently assess positive or negative training adaptation would be advantageous to athletes, sport scientists and coaches alike.\n\n### HRV and Training Maladaptation\n\nThe hypothesis behind the early detection of non-functional overreaching (NFOR) or overtraining (OT) and fatigue is the possibility of assuring adequate recovery through specified rest between training. By allowing recovery based on the constantly changing dynamic of the athlete and the amount of further training needed, the recovery optimises future performance. The performance begins to decline if the recovery is not adequate, resulting in a continuum from functional overreaching (F-OR), NFOR, OT and, eventually, overtraining syndrome (OTS).[32]\n\nIn athletes, changes in the patterns of their autonomic nervous system (ANS) reflected by altered HRV may serve as useful objective parameters for managing their physical fatigue. Information regarding the extent to which the body recovers after training may provide useful data to avoid NFOR, OT and OTS. Many studies have examined HRV and overtraining have revealed ambivalent findings, with increases, decreases, and no change in HRV reported (*Table 4*).[33\u201336] In one case study, a junior skier with reported OT had a substantially increased HRV and the values subsequently decreases once the athlete had undergone a recovery period.[34] Conversely, Mourot et al.[37] showed that overtraining was associated with decreased HRV. Seven athletes had endurance training and had been clinically diagnosed with OTS. However, given the continuum from F-OR to OTS, and the difficulty in deciphering between stages, these differences observed may be due to inconsistencies in the accurate diagnosis of the fatigue stage.[38,39] This may be one of the reasons why more recent studies have focused on F-OR rather than NFOR and OT,which can be quantified by decreases and subsequent increases in performance (after a taper period).[38,40\u201342] Accordingly, these data demonstrate the importance of understanding where each athlete sits on this continuum of fatigue (F-OR\u2192NFOR\u2192OT\u2192OTS). Such knowledge is critical for the accurate interpretation of HRV results to regulate athlete training.\n\n#### Table 4: Summary of Studies Showing the Effects of Functional Overreaching, Non-Functional Overreaching and Overtraining on Vagal-Related HRV.\n\n|Study|Number of Participants, Sex and Fitness Level|Exercise|HRV Measurement Timing|HRV Analysis Method|HRV Recording Method|Main Findings|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|Uusitalo et al. 1998[33]|9 F, endurance trained athletes|Individualised training programme, progressively increased training load for 6\u20139 weeks; 4\u20136 weeks of recovery training|Before and after 4 weeks, after 6\u20139 weeks of training, after 4\u20136 weeks of recovery training|TD, FD|5-min supine (0.2 Hz respiration rate)|Overtrained athletes trend of lowered HRV for four weeks of overload and raised HRV after recovery period; non-overtrained athletes had raised HRV for duration of the training period|\n|Uusitalo et al. 2000[62]|9 F, well-trained|6\u20139 weeks|Before and after 4 weeks and after 9 weeks|TD, FD|25-min supine, 5 min standing|Lower HRV after heavy training supine rest/over-training.

As day-to-day HRV values are too variable, the authors demonstrated that when HRV were averaged over a 1-week period, they consistently showed substantially lower HRV values because of NFOR. Such findings have been subsequently supported by other research studies.[41,44,45]\n\n### HRV and Training Adaptation\n\nEndurance training elicits marked changes in cardiorespiratory function in both sedentary and active individuals, concomitant to changes in cardiac vagal activity, as evidenced by reduced resting and exercise HR.[46] As such, the individualised nature of changes in HRV is fundamental to its use as a marker of training adaptation.[47]\n\nThe changes in HRV in response to endurance training programmes have been extensively studied (*Table 5*). In people who have been sedentary or who have trained recreationally, endurance training for 2, 6 and 9 weeks has been shown to induce parallel increases in aerobic fitness and HRV.[45,48,49] For example, previously sedentary men completed 9 weeks of intensive endurance training followed by 4 weeks of overload training and had large increases in maximal aerobic capacity (+20 %) and vagal-related HRV (+67 %).[50] While this is the response typically seen in sedentary and recreationally trained people after a period of endurance training, the response in people who have an extensive training history can be decidedly different. In these athletes, the HRV response to training is inconsistent, with longitudinal studies showing no change in fitness (VO~2~ max uptake) despite increases in HRV, and cross-sectional studies showing lower HRV in association with superior fitness.[52,52] In elite distance runners training for 18 weeks (6 weeks moderately intensive and 12 weeks intensive) culminating in a half marathon or marathon, there was no change in VO~2~ max, but a 45 % increase in HRV.[45] Conversely, in 55 young male soccer players, lower HRV was associated with higher VO~2~ max and maximum aerobic speed.[49]\n\n#### Table 5: Longitudinal and Cross-Sectional Studies Related to the Effects of Long-Term Exercise Training on Vagal-Related HRV and Performance/Fitness.\n\n|Study|Number of Participants, Sex and Fitness Level|Exercise|HRV Measurement Timing|HRV Analysis Method|HRV Recording Method|Main Findings|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|Hedelin et al. 2000[63]|8 M, 9 F elite junior cross-country skiers and canoeists|7 months of training during competitive season|Before and after 7-month training period|FD|5 min supine (spontaneous respiration), 1 min supine (0.2 Hz respiration rate), 5 min 70\u00b0 vertical tilt|No change to HRV after training; higher pre-training HRV related to raised VO~2~ max|\n|Yamamoto et al. 2001[69]|7 M healthy students|40 min cycling training at 80 % VO~2~ peak four times a week (matched with raised fitness)|Pre-exercise, 10 min, 20 min post-exercise.

Those classified in the F-OR had large increases in running performance over an incremental running rest (effect size 1.17 \u00b1 0.22). Similarly, Bellenger et al showed HRV increases in triatheletes (effect size = 0.62 \u00b1 0.26) after a 2-week heavy training period. These increases were reduced after a 10-day taper which coincided with improved 5 km running time trial performance (effect size -0.34 \u00b1 0.08). Importantly, in both these studies, there were observed reductions in performance after the training overload period, when HRV was substantial higher. Accordingly, in such cases, increases in HRV are indicative of coping with intensified training (i.e. F-OR), not increases in performance. Improved performance was only observed after the taper period when HRV had reduced back towards baseline levels.\n\nTaking these data into account, it has been suggested that there is a bell-shaped relationship between vagally related HRV and fitness/performance.[49] This, to some extent, may also be due to HRV saturation which is often seen in athletes with extensive training histories and low resting heart rates.[54]\n\n### Using HRV to Guide Training\n\nGiven the usability of HRV to track training adaptations, it could be used as a tool to guide daily training. Three studies have shown training guided by the daily recordings of HRV to be superior (at increasing fitness and exercise performance) to training based on conventional methods.[55\u201357]\n\nRecently, Vesterinen et al. investigated the effectiveness of using HRV to prescribe training on a day-to-day basis.[57] Forty recreational endurance runners were divided into the HRV-guided experimental training group (EXP) and traditional pre-defined training (TRAD). After a 4-week preparation training period, the TRAD group trained according to a predefined training programme including two-to-three moderate (MOD) and high-intensity training (HIT) sessions per week during an 8-week intensive training period. The timing of MOD and HIT sessions in EXP was based on HRV measured every morning. RMSSD was used to prescribe training because of its greater reliability than other HRV spectral indices.[58] A 7-day rolling average of RMSSD was calculated because it has been proposed to be more sensitive to track changes in the training status compared with single-day values.[53] The MOD/HIT session was programmed if HRV was within an individually determined smallest change. Otherwise, low-intensity training was performed. VO~2~ max and 3,000 m running performance were measured before and after both training periods. The number of MOD and HIT sessions was significantly lower (p=0.021, effect size 0.98) in the EXP group (13.2 \u00b1 6.0 sessions) compared with TRAD (17.7 \u00b1 2.5 sessions). No other differences in training were found between the groups. The 3,000 m run time improved in EXP (2.1 % T 2.0 %, p=0.004) but not in the TRAD group (1.1 % T 2.7 %, p=0.118) during the intensive training period. A small but clear between-group difference (effect size = 0.42) was found in the change in running performance over 3,000 m. VO~2~ max improved in both groups (EXP: 3.7 %, \u00b1 4.6 %, p=0.027; TRAD: 5.0 % \u00b1 5.2 %, p=0.002). They concluded that there was potential in using resting HRV to prescribe endurance training by individualising the timing of vigorous training sessions.\n\nTwo studies by Kiviniemi et al. also showed superior responses to training when guided by daily HRV, similar to Vesterinen et al.[55\u201357] Greater improvements in VO~2~ max and maximal attainable workload[56] in groups of trained subjects who performed high-intensity training when morning resting HRV was high, and low-intensity training when these values were low. This was despite the HRV-guided training group performing HIT sessions less frequently than a traditional training group (average three compared with 4-hour HIT sessions per week). Hence, adaptation was improved when lower intensity training was completed when vagal modulation of HR was attenuated.\n\nA study from 2018 split 17 well-trained cyclists into two groups.[59] Group one followed a training plan guided by morning resting HRV (HRV-G, n=9), whereas group 2 followed a more traditional approach (TRAD, n=8). Following a similar design to Kiviniemi, on days when the 7-day rolling average of RMSSD fell outside the predetermined individual smallest range, the HRV-G training group would carry out low intensity training or rest rather than moderate-intensity training or HIT.[55] The TRAD group\u2019s training regimens included scheduled low-intensity, moderate-intensity, HIT and high-intensity interval training. There were no statistical differences in volume or intensity distribution in either group during the experimental period. Although there were no between-group differences, the HRV-G group substantially increased in peak power output (5.1 \u00b1 4.5 %; p=0.024), upper threshold power (13.9 \u00b1 8.8 %; p=0.004) and 40 km time trial performance (7.3 \u00b1 4.5 %; p=0.005). The TRAD group did not improve significantly in any of these performance measures after their training period. This again supports the possible efficacy of HRV-G training being a suitable method to enhance training adaptations in athletes.\n\nMethodological considerations are important when using HRV to monitor training in athletes. However, it is generally accepted that reductions in HRV are associated with negative performance outcomes, and increases associated with a positive response to higher training loads (*Tables 4 and 5*). However, such changes must be taken within the context of the training phase (i.e heavy training versus taper), and fitness status of the individual.[60] Both supportive and opposing views have been highlighted in a recent HRV and exercise training meta-analysis by Bellenger et al.[61] The aim of this meta-analysis was to interpret how vagally derived indices of HR could be used to inform training decisions. Focusing on HRV only here, they suggested that improved exercise performance was associated with increases in resting RMSSD (effect size = 0.58). However, there was also a small increase in resting RMSSD (effect size = 0.26) associated with decreases in performance. This supports the idea that, although HRV measures can be useful, they should still be used alongside other measures of training tolerance to aid decision-making.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe past decade has shown that HRV provides valuable prognostic information that can contribute to risk scores and cardiac variables such as echocardiographic measurements and exercise capacity. There is strong evidence to suggest that elevated HRV has a protective effect against CV disease. Conversely, exercise and HRV show the opposite relationship. Greater HRV during recovery from exercise is associated with an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death. However, other investigators have argued that these findings may be predominantly driven by heart rate alone and further research is required in this area. Over more recent years, the area of HRV and athlete monitoring has been investigated. It is now generally accepted that substantial reductions in HRV are associated with negative adaptations to training and HRV increases are associated with positive adaptations, with an inverted U shape being the optimal trend in HRV in athletes before they reach peak performance. Furthermore, studies that have based daily training sessions on morning resting HRV values have had mostly positive outcomes.\n\nIn the era of wearable monitoring devices and increased interest in personalised approaches to lifestyle modification, HRV may provide useful information to direct lifestyle change, guide exercise regimens and monitor for over-training. Given the advancement in wearable HRV recording devices, research is needed to understand the complex relationships between physiology and performance and day-to-day trends. Furthermore, future population studies are needed to assess the potential of HRV information acquired through wearable devices which use photo-based plethysmography and ECG technology and validate its value as a prognostic marker.\n\n### Clinical Perspective\n- Resting, exercise and ambulatory heart rate variability (HRV) measure\u00adments are useful for predicting cardiovascular risk.\n- The use of mHealth technologies allows acceptable ambulatory detection of HRV compared with traditional ECG methods.\n- The data behind using ambulatory HRV to guide or structure athletic training programmes are limited, but there is a possible benefit in using HRV to optimise performance and prevent over-training\n\n## References\n- 1.Hillebrand S, Gast KB, de Mutsert R et al.

Athletes push a sled over 50 meters (2 x 25m), with weights stacked depending on the division.\n\nThe listed weight includes the sled (usually ~30\u201340 kg) plus added plates.\n\n**Open Women**: 102 kg **Pro Women**: 152 kg **Open Men**: 152 kg **Pro Men**: 202 kg\n\nTip: Traction and pushing form matter more than brute strength.\n\n## HYROX Sled Pull weight\n\nThe HYROX sled pull station uses the same sled as the sled push, but now you're pulling it 50 meters (2 x 25m) with arm and back strength.\n\nThe weights are slightly lower than the sled push.\n\n**Open Women**: 78 kg **Pro Women**: 103 kg **Open Men**: 103 kg **Pro Men**: 153 kg\n\nTrain with heavy rope pulls and seated row variations.\n\n## Farmers Carry HYROX Weights\n\nYou\u2019ll carry two kettlebells or dumbbells over a 200 meter course.\n\nCore and grip endurance are key for the HYROX farmers carry.\n\n**Open Women**: 2 \u00d7 16 kg **Pro Women**: 2 \u00d7 24 kg **Open Men**: 2 \u00d7 24 kg **Pro Men**: 2 \u00d7 32 kg\n\nPro tip: Keep shoulders back and walk tall to avoid fatigue.\n\n## HYROX Lunge weight\n\nThis 100-meter walking HYROX lunge with a sandbag on your back will test your legs and mental focus late in the race.\n\n**Open Women**: 10 kg **Pro Women**: 20 kg **Open Men**: 20 kg **Pro Men**: 30 kg\n\nNo dropping of the sandbag, try to make it one continuous effort.\n\n## HYROX Wall Ball weight\n\nThe race ends with HYROX wall balls: squat and throw to a target.\n\nThe weight and rep count depend on your category.\n\n**Open Women**: 100 reps with 4 kg to a 2.70 m target **Pro Women**: 100 reps with 6 kg to a 2.70 m target **Open Men**: 100 reps with 6 kg to a 3 m target **Pro Men**: 100 reps with 9 kg to a 3 m target\n\nAccuracy and pacing are critical here.\n\n## HYROX Cardio Standards: Running, SkiErg & RowErg\n\nWhile these HYROX stations don\u2019t have weights, they\u2019re just as crucial for your performance:\n\n**HYROX SkiErg**: 1000 meters **HYROX RowErg**: 1000 meters **HYROX Running**: 8 \u00d7 1,000 meters (one run between every station)\n\nThese distances are the same across all divisions (Open and Pro, men and women).\n\nTo perform well at the HYROX event, you\u2019ll need to move efficiently on each machine and pace your runs wisely. The perfect balance to perform as a great hybrid athlete.\n\n**SkiErg focus**: Smooth pulls, consistent breathing **RowErg focus**: Strong drive, relaxed return **Running focus**: Recovery pace early, acceleration in later rounds\n\n## Why HYROX weights matter\n\nTraining with the official HYROX weights is non-negotiable if you want to perform well on race day.\n\nEach station places a unique demand on your body, from explosive sled pushes to endurance-driven wall balls.

          "text": "Now I have comprehensive research data. Let me compile the complete framework.\n\n---\n\n# HYROX AI Coach: Autoregulation & Adaptive Programming Framework\n\n> **Version:** 2.0 \u00b7 **Effective:** February 2026\n> **Purpose:** This document defines every decision rule, threshold, and communication template the AI coach uses to modify the 16-week Hyrox periodization plan in real time. It is the system's adaptive intelligence layer\u2014no rule may output vague language such as \"adjust accordingly.\"\n\n---\n\n## 1. RPE-Based Session Modification Rules\n\n### 1.1 Pre-Session Readiness Check\n\nBefore every session, the AI coach asks the athlete five standardized questions, each scored 1\u201310. The composite **Readiness Score** is the equally weighted average of all five sub-scores, rounded to one decimal place. Research supports multi-dimensional subjective wellness questionnaires as superior predictors of training tolerance compared with objective measures alone (Saw, Main & Gastin, 2016, *BJSM*; Thorpe et al., 2017, *IJSPP*).\n\n| # | Readiness Question | Anchors (1 = worst, 10 = best) |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1 | **Sleep Quality** \u2014 \"Rate your sleep last night.\" | 1 = \u22644 hrs or constantly waking; 5 = ~6 hrs, average quality; 10 = 8+ hrs, deep, uninterrupted |\n| 2 | **Muscle Soreness** \u2014 \"How sore are you right now?\" | 1 = severe pain / cannot move freely; 5 = moderate tightness; 10 = no soreness at all |\n| 3 | **Motivation** \u2014 \"How eager are you to train today?\" | 1 = dreading it; 5 = neutral; 10 = fired up |\n| 4 | **Life Stress** \u2014 \"Rate your mental/emotional stress.\" | 1 = extreme stress/crisis; 5 = manageable; 10 = totally calm |\n| 5 | **Nutrition / Hydration** \u2014 \"How well did you eat and hydrate in the past 24 hours?\" | 1 = missed meals, dehydrated; 5 = okay; 10 = dialed in |\n\n**Readiness Score = (Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4 + Q5) / 5**\n\n### 1.2 Readiness Tier Decision Table\n\n| Readiness Score | Tier Label | Session Modification |\n|---|---|---|\n| **8.0\u201310.0** | \ud83d\udfe2 **Green \u2014 Execute** | Run session exactly as programmed. If athlete has been in Green for 5+ consecutive sessions and RPE stays \u22646, flag for potential under-programming (see Rule CR-2). |\n| **6.0\u20137.9** | \ud83d\udfe1 **Yellow \u2014 Modify** | Reduce **total volume by 20%** (cut lowest-priority sets/intervals first). Maintain programmed intensity. If the session is HIIT, remove the final 1\u20132 rounds. If the session is strength, drop the last accessory exercise and reduce main-lift sets by 1. If the session is running, shorten distance by 20% but keep target pace. |\n| **4.0\u20135.9** | \ud83d\udfe0 **Orange \u2014 Significant Modification** | Reduce **volume by 40%** AND reduce **intensity by 10\u201315%** (drop pace targets by 10\u201315 sec/km; drop strength loads by 10\u201315%). Convert any HIIT session to a moderate-intensity continuous session (Zone 2 run + bodyweight movement flow for 25\u201335 min). Cap session duration at 40 minutes. |\n| **1.0\u20133.9** | \ud83d\udd34 **Red \u2014 Recovery Session** | Replace planned session with one of the following: (a) 20-min walk + 15-min mobility/foam rolling, (b) 20-min easy swim or bike at HR <120 bpm + 10-min breathwork/meditation, (c) Full rest day with guided stretching video (15 min). Log as \"recovery replacement.\" Re-assess readiness next day. If athlete scores Red 2+ consecutive days, trigger Overtraining Investigation Protocol (see Rule CR-13). |\n\n### 1.3 During-Session RPE Monitoring\n\nThe AI coach requests RPE checks at three points within each session. RPE is collected on the standard Borg CR-10 scale, validated for both resistance training (Zourdos et al., 2016, *JSCR*) and endurance exercise (Foster et al., 2001, *JSCR*).\n\n#### 1.3.1 Post-Warm-Up Check (after first 8\u201310 minutes)\n\n| Warm-Up RPE | Expected RPE | Action |\n|---|---|---|\n| \u22645 | 3\u20135 | \u2705 Proceed as planned. |\n| 6 | 3\u20135 | \u26a0\ufe0f Note elevated effort. Extend warm-up by 5 min of easy movement. Re-check. If RPE drops to \u22645 \u2192 proceed. If RPE stays \u22656 \u2192 downgrade session by one tier (e.g., Green \u2192 Yellow modifications). |\n| 7+ | 3\u20135 | \ud83d\uded1 Downgrade session by **two tiers** (e.g., Green \u2192 Orange). If warm-up RPE \u2265 8 \u2192 convert entire session to recovery (Red tier). Log event and flag for pattern tracking. |\n\n#### 1.3.2 Mid-Session Check (at session midpoint)\n\n| Mid-Session RPE vs. Target | Action |\n|---|---|\n| Within \u00b11 of target | \u2705 Continue as planned. |\n| 1.5\u20132 points above target | Reduce remaining volume by 25%. Extend rest periods by 30 seconds between sets/intervals. |\n| >2 points above target | **End high-intensity work immediately.** Complete 5-min cool-down at RPE \u22643. Log as \"session cut short \u2014 elevated RPE.\" Attribute remaining volume as missed and apply Missed Session Logic (Section 2) at the 1-session level. |\n| 2+ points below target | Add 1\u20132 additional rounds/sets (up to 15% extra volume) OR increase pace/load by 5% for remaining work. |\n\n#### 1.3.3 Post-Session RPE (sRPE \u2014 Session RPE)\n\nCollected 15\u201330 minutes after session completion per Foster et al. (2001) methodology. **sRPE \u00d7 session duration (min) = session load (AU).**\n\n| Data Point | How It's Used |\n|---|---|\n| sRPE logged | Stored in 7-day rolling average. Compared to programmed target RPE. |\n| sRPE \u00d7 duration = load (AU) | Acute load (7-day sum) and chronic load (28-day average) tracked. Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR) calculated weekly. |\n| ACWR 0.8\u20131.3 | \u2705 Training load in safe zone (Gabbett, 2016, *BJSM*). |\n| ACWR >1.5 | \ud83d\uded1 Spike detected \u2014 reduce next 3 sessions by 20% volume. |\n| ACWR <0.7 | \u26a0\ufe0f Detraining risk \u2014 increase next week's volume by 10\u201315%. |\n\n### 1.4 Cross-Session Adaptation Rules (CR Rules)\n\nThese 18 if/then rules fire automatically based on accumulated session data. Each rule references specific thresholds, session types, and corrective actions.\n\n#### Fatigue & Overload Rules\n\n| Rule ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) |\n|---|---|---|\n| **CR-1** | RPE > 8 on 2 consecutive HIIT sessions | Reduce next HIIT session volume by 25% (remove final 2 rounds). Insert 1 additional Zone 2 run (30\u201340 min, RPE 3\u20134) before the next HIIT session. |\n| **CR-2** | RPE < 5 on 3 consecutive sessions of any type | Increase intensity by 5\u201310% (add 5\u201310 sec/km to pace targets, or 5\u201310% to strength loads) OR add 1 additional set/round to the next 2 sessions. |\n| **CR-3** | RPE \u2265 9 on any \"easy\" session (programmed target RPE \u22645) | Flag **overtraining investigation**: prompt athlete for illness symptoms, check 7-day sleep average, review preceding 14-day training load. If sleep avg < 6 hrs \u2192 trigger lifestyle intervention (Section 5). If no lifestyle explanation \u2192 insert 2 consecutive rest days and reduce following week volume by 30%. |\n| **CR-4** | RPE > 8 on 3 out of 4 strength sessions within a 2-week block | Reduce strength training loads by 10% for the next mesocycle. Add 1 extra rest day between strength sessions. If within 4 weeks of competition, convert one strength session per week to strength-endurance (lighter load, higher rep, circuit format). |\n| **CR-5** | RPE < 4 on 2 consecutive strength sessions | Increase working loads by 5\u20137.5% on main lifts (squat, deadlift, bench press, overhead press). Keep accessory volumes unchanged. |\n\n#### Running-Specific Rules\n\n| Rule ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) |\n|---|---|---|\n| **CR-6** | Running RPE > planned RPE by \u22652 points on 2 out of 3 runs in a week | Reduce next week's total running volume by 15\u201320%. Convert 1 interval/tempo run to a Zone 2 easy run. Review shoe condition and check for injury signs. |\n| **CR-7** | Running RPE consistently 1\u20132 points below target for \u22652 weeks | Advance running pace targets by 5 sec/km. If the athlete is in General Prep, consider moving to Specific Prep running intensities early. |\n| **CR-8** | Athlete reports RPE \u2265 8 on \u22653 of the 8 running segments during a simulation | Identify which running segments (early vs. late) are most affected. If segments 5\u20138 are elevated \u2192 increase long-run volume by 10% and add a second Zone 2 run per week. If segments 1\u20133 are elevated \u2192 athlete is starting too fast; prescribe pacing drill with negative-split structure. |\n\n#### HIIT & Simulation-Specific Rules\n\n| Rule ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) |\n|---|---|---|\n| **CR-9** | Average HIIT sRPE over 4-week block exceeds programmed target by >1 point | Reduce HIIT density: increase work:rest ratio from 1:1 to 1:1.5, or from 1:0.5 to 1:1 for the next 2-week block. Maintain total session duration. |\n| **CR-10** | Simulation sRPE \u2265 9 AND total sim time is >10% slower than goal pace | Add 1 half-simulation per week (4 stations + 4 \u00d7 1 km) at race pace for 3 weeks, focusing on the 4 weakest stations. Reduce full-simulation frequency to every 14 days instead of every 10 days. |\n| **CR-11** | Simulation sRPE \u2264 6 AND total sim time is within 5% of goal pace | Athlete is ready for progression. Increase simulation specificity: add transition drills (Roxzone efficiency practice), and in the next full sim, attempt a 2\u20133% negative split in running segments. |\n\n#### Deload & Recovery Triggers\n\n| Rule ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) |\n|---|---|---|\n| **CR-12** | Average weekly Readiness Score drops below 6.0 for 2 consecutive weeks | Insert an **unscheduled deload week**: reduce all volumes by 40%, reduce all intensities by 15%, replace 1 HIIT session with Zone 2 cardio, add 1 full rest day. Resume normal programming after 7 days if Readiness returns to \u22657.0. |\n| **CR-13** | Readiness Score \u2264 3.9 for 3+ consecutive days | Trigger **Overtraining Investigation Protocol**: (1) Suspend all training for 48 hours. (2) Request physician clearance if illness suspected. (3) On return, apply the \"Miss a Full Week\" protocol (Section 2.4). (4) Log incident for macro-cycle review. |\n| **CR-14** | HRV 7-day rolling average drops >1 SD below personal baseline for \u22655 consecutive days (if wearable data available) | Reduce high-intensity sessions by 50% for the following week. Replace with Zone 1\u20132 aerobic work. This aligns with Plews et al. (2013) findings and Kiviniemi et al. (2007, 2010) HRV-guided training research showing improved adaptation when training is reduced during periods of attenuated vagal tone. |\n\n#### Progressive Overload Guards\n\n| Rule ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) |\n|---|---|---|\n| **CR-15** | Athlete completes all sessions in a week at programmed volume/intensity with average sRPE \u2264 programmed target for 3 consecutive weeks | Auto-progress: increase running volume by 5\u20138%, HIIT rounds by 1, or strength loads by 2.5\u20135% in the following week. This aligns with DeLorme's (1946) original progressive overload principles and modern autoregulation research (Greig et al., 2020, *Sports Med*). |\n| **CR-16** | Athlete's ACWR exceeds 1.3 for 2 consecutive weeks | Cap the following week's acute load to \u22641.2 \u00d7 chronic load. Achieve this by removing the lowest-priority session of the week. |\n| **CR-17** | Readiness Score \u2265 8 for 10+ consecutive sessions AND sRPE consistently \u2264 5 | Possible under-training. Increase weekly training frequency by 1 session (add a station-specific supplemental session) OR increase session density by 10%. Monitor for 2 weeks. |\n| **CR-18** | Post-session RPE deviates from target RPE by >2 points (in either direction) on \u226550% of sessions in a 2-week block | Recalibrate athlete's RPE anchoring: provide RPE education refresher, re-assess training zones with a benchmark test. If calibration seems accurate, adjust the entire plan's target RPEs to match athlete's actual response curve. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Missed Session Recovery Logic\n\n### 2.1 Session Priority Hierarchy by Training Phase\n\nEvery session type carries a priority rank that dictates which sessions to protect when time is limited or sessions are missed.\n\n| Priority | General Prep (Wk 1\u20134) | Specific Prep (Wk 5\u20138) | Competition Prep (Wk 9\u201314) | Taper (Wk 15\u201316) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 (Must-Do) | Long Run / Zone 2 Run | HIIT (Hyrox-style intervals) | Full/Half Simulation | Short High-Intensity Intervals (\u226420 min) |\n| 2 | HIIT (general conditioning) | Tempo/Threshold Run | HIIT (race-specific) | Easy Run (20\u201330 min) |\n| 3 | Strength (full body) | Strength (functional) | Threshold Running | Mobility / Active Recovery |\n| 4 | Mobility / Recovery | Mobility / Recovery | Strength (maintenance) | Everything else is optional |\n\n### 2.2 Missed Session Decision Matrix\n\n| Scenario | Decision Logic |\n|---|---|\n| **Miss 1 session in a week** | **Do NOT reschedule if it was Priority 3 or 4.** If Priority 1 or 2: compress into an adjacent day by combining it as a reduced-volume add-on (50% of original volume appended as a \"bonus block\" to the next session, adding \u226415 min). Never stack 2 full sessions on the same day. |\n| **Miss 2 sessions in a week** | Protect the **top 2 priority sessions** for the current phase. Remove the lowest-priority remaining session. Redistribute: take the most important missed session and insert it at 75% volume on the nearest available day. Accept the second missed session as lost volume \u2014 do NOT chase it. |\n| **Miss 3+ sessions (illness/travel)** | Stop chasing missed volume entirely. Re-enter training using the **Graduated Return Protocol** (Section 2.4). Assess Readiness Score on the first day back. If Readiness \u2265 7: resume at 70% of planned volume for 3 days, then 85% for 3 days, then 100%. If Readiness 5\u20136: resume at 50% volume for 4 days, then 70% for 3 days, then 85% for 3 days. |\n| **Miss a full week** | Apply the **50/30/20/10 Return Rule** adapted from NSCA/CSCCa consensus guidelines: **Day 1\u20132:** 50% of normal session volume, RPE cap of 5. **Day 3\u20134:** 70% volume, RPE cap of 6. **Day 5\u20137:** 85% volume, RPE cap of 7. **Week 2:** 100% volume. No benchmark testing for \u226510 days post-return. This is supported by the graduated return-to-play protocols (Elliott et al., 2020, *BJSM*; NSCA/CSCCa Joint Guidelines). |\n| **Miss 2+ weeks (injury/illness)** | Require medical clearance before resuming. On clearance: restart training at the **beginning of the previous mesocycle** at 50% volume. Progress per the 50/30/20/10 rule over 2 weeks. Reassess goal time and potentially extend the 16-week plan by the number of weeks missed. Retest all benchmarks at the 2-week post-return mark. |\n\n### 2.3 \"Which Sessions Can I Skip?\" Quick Reference\n\n| Session Type | Skip-able? | Consequence of Skipping |\n|---|---|---|\n| Full Simulation (Competition Prep) | \u274c Never skip | Reschedule within 3 days, even at reduced volume (half-sim) |\n| HIIT \u2014 Race-Specific | \u274c Rarely skip | If must skip, replace with a 30-min threshold run to preserve metabolic stimulus |\n| Long Run (>45 min) | \u26a0\ufe0f Conditional | Can skip 1 per 3-week block; replace with 2 shorter Zone 2 runs |\n| Strength \u2014 Main Lifts | \u26a0\ufe0f Conditional | Can skip if already completed 1 strength session that week |\n| Strength \u2014 Accessories | \u2705 Yes | Lowest consequence; absorb into warm-up of next session as activation work |\n| Easy Run / Recovery | \u2705 Yes | Replace with walking or rest with zero guilt |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Time-Constrained Session Modifications\n\nWhen an athlete reports they have less time than the planned session requires, the AI compresses the session according to the **\"protect intensity, sacrifice volume\"** principle (Helms et al., 2018, *JSCR*; Graham & Cleather, 2019).\n\n### 3.1 Universal Compression Matrix\n\n| Planned Duration | Available Time | Compression Level | General Rule |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 60 min | **45 min** (75%) | Moderate | Cut warm-up to 5 min (from 10), cut cool-down to 3 min (from 7\u201310). Remove the lowest-priority element. Keep main set at full intensity and \u226575% of prescribed volume. |\n| 60 min | **30 min** (50%) | Aggressive | Warm-up = 3 min only (dynamic). Cool-down = walk for 2 min. Execute **only the main set** at full intensity with 60% of prescribed volume. All accessories/supplementary work removed. |\n| 60 min | **15 min** (25%) | Emergency Minimum | No formal warm-up (begin at 50% effort, ramp over 2 min). Execute the single highest-priority element at full intensity for the maximum possible work in 10 min. 3-min cool-down walk. Log as \"emergency session.\" |\n\n### 3.2 Compression Rules by Session Type\n\n#### Running Sessions\n\n| Available Time | Modification |\n|---|---|\n| 45 min (from 60) | Keep main interval/tempo set unchanged. Cut warm-up jog from 10 min to 5 min. Cut cool-down from 10 min to 5 min. Remove any strides/drills. |\n| 30 min | 3-min warm-up jog \u2192 Execute main set at prescribed intensity (e.g., tempo or intervals) for 22 min \u2192 5-min easy jog cool-down. If tempo run: maintain pace, shorten distance proportionally. |\n| 15 min | 2-min build-up jog \u2192 10 min at threshold pace (RPE 7\u20138) \u2192 3-min walk. Preserves top-end aerobic stimulus. |\n\n#### HIIT Sessions\n\n| Available Time | Modification |\n|---|---|\n| 45 min (from 60) | Keep all prescribed movements. Reduce total rounds by 2 (e.g., 6 rounds \u2192 4 rounds). Maintain prescribed work:rest ratio and intensity. |\n| 30 min | Keep the 4 most Hyrox-relevant movements, remove any supplemental/accessory exercises. Perform 3 rounds at prescribed intensity. Rest periods shortened by 15 sec each. |\n| 15 min | **\"Hyrox Essentials\" EMOM:** 10-min EMOM alternating between sled push simulation (30 sec max effort) and wall balls (20 reps) + 5-min cool-down. |\n\n#### Strength Sessions\n\n| Available Time | Modification |\n|---|---|\n| 45 min (from 60) | Keep all main compound lifts (squat, deadlift, press). Remove all accessories (curls, lateral raises, etc.). Keep programmed sets, reps, and loads for main lifts. |\n| 30 min | Select the 2 most relevant main lifts (lower body + upper body). Perform programmed sets and loads. Superset where possible to save time. |\n| 15 min | Perform 1 compound lift only (prioritize the weakest pattern). 3 working sets at programmed intensity. Example: 3 \u00d7 5 back squat at prescribed load. Done in <12 min. |\n\n#### Simulation Sessions\n\n| Available Time | Modification |\n|---|---|\n| 45 min (from 60) | **Half-simulation:** 4 \u00d7 1 km run + 4 stations. Select the 4 weakest stations based on most recent benchmark data. Execute at full race pace. |\n| 30 min | **Quarter-simulation:** 2 \u00d7 1 km run + 2 stations (the 2 weakest). Full race effort. Plus 5-min cool-down jog. |\n| 15 min | **Single-station drill:** 1 km run at race pace \u2192 1 full station at race effort \u2192 1 km run at race pace. Choose the single weakest station. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Performance-Based Plan Adjustments\n\n### 4.1 Benchmark Test Schedule\n\nThe AI coach schedules benchmark tests at the end of every 4-week block (Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 15 for final check).\n\n| Benchmark Test | What It Measures | Protocol |\n|---|---|---|\n| 5 km Time Trial | Aerobic running fitness | Outdoor or treadmill, best effort, record time and average pace |\n| Individual Station Tests | Station-specific performance | Each Hyrox station performed in isolation: SkiErg 1,000 m, Row 1,000 m, Sled Push 50 m, Sled Pull 50 m, Burpee Broad Jumps 80 m, Farmer's Carry 200 m, Lunges 100 m, Wall Balls 100 reps (men) / 100 reps (women). Record time for each. |\n| Half Simulation | Race-day readiness | 4 \u00d7 1 km run + 4 stations, timed. |\n| Full Simulation | Goal pace validation | All 8 \u00d7 1 km + 8 stations, timed (every 6\u20138 weeks max). |\n\n### 4.2 Performance-Based Adjustment Rules\n\n| Rule ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) |\n|---|---|---|\n| **PB-1** | 5 km running pace improves >5% at monthly benchmark | Advance to next phase's running intensity targets immediately. E.g., if in General Prep, adopt Specific Prep pace zones. Recalculate all interval paces based on new benchmark. |\n| **PB-2** | 5 km running pace regresses >3% at monthly benchmark | Investigate: check ACWR for overtraining spike, review sleep/stress data. If ACWR >1.4 \u2192 insert a deload week. If ACWR normal \u2192 add 1 additional easy run per week to build aerobic base. Retest in 2 weeks. |\n| **PB-3** | Any individual station time stagnates (\u22641% improvement) for 4+ weeks | Add a **targeted station intervention block**: 2 additional station-specific sessions per week for 3 weeks (15\u201320 min each), placed on existing training days as add-ons. Example: if SkiErg stagnates \u2192 add 2 \u00d7 SkiErg-focused sessions (5 \u00d7 200 m intervals at RPE 8 with 90-sec rest). |\n| **PB-4** | Full simulation time is >15% slower than goal pace | Reassess goal pace \u2014 it may be unrealistic. If goal remains valid, shift training emphasis: increase simulation frequency to every 10 days, add 1 half-sim per week, and reduce general strength to maintenance (1\u00d7/week). |\n| **PB-5** | Full simulation time is within 5% of goal pace with 6+ weeks remaining | Athlete is ahead of schedule. Maintain current approach; do not increase training load unnecessarily. Focus remaining weeks on race-day tactics: pacing, transitions, nutrition strategy. Consider targeting a faster goal if athlete is motivated. |\n| **PB-6** | One station time is >20% slower than the athlete's tier-adjusted average | Trigger **Station-Specific Intervention** (see Weakness Identification Matrix below). Dedicate 3 supplemental sessions/week to that station for a 3-week block. |\n| **PB-7** | Athlete improves by >10% on a previously weak station after intervention | Return station to normal training frequency. Reallocate supplemental time to the next-weakest station or general conditioning. |\n\n### 4.3 Weakness Identification Matrix\n\nThis matrix compares the athlete's individual station times against tier-normative data to compute a **Station Performance Index (SPI)** for each station. SPI = (Athlete's Station Time / Tier Average Station Time) \u00d7 100. An SPI of 100 = exactly average for their tier. SPI > 115 = significantly weak. SPI < 90 = relative strength.\n\n**Tier norms** are based on published Hyrox results data and categorized by goal finish time:\n\n| Station | Elite (<70 min) | Competitive (70\u201385 min) | Intermediate (85\u2013100 min) | Beginner (100\u2013120 min) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| SkiErg 1,000 m | 3:15 | 3:50 | 4:30 | 5:30 |\n| Sled Push 50 m | 1:30 | 2:15 | 3:15 | 4:30 |\n| Sled Pull 50 m | 1:20 | 2:00 | 3:00 | 4:15 |\n| Burpee Broad Jumps 80 m | 3:00 | 4:00 | 5:30 | 7:00 |\n| Row 1,000 m | 3:20 | 3:55 | 4:30 | 5:30 |\n| Farmer's Carry 200 m | 1:30 | 2:00 | 2:45 | 3:30 |\n| Lunges 100 m | 3:00 | 4:15 | 5:45 | 7:30 |\n| Wall Balls 100 reps | 4:00 | 5:30 | 7:00 | 9:00 |\n\n**Interpretation Rules:**\n\n| SPI Range | Classification | AI Coach Action |\n|---|---|---|\n| SPI < 90 | \ud83d\udfe2 Relative Strength | Maintain current training. No extra work needed. |\n| SPI 90\u2013105 | \u26aa On Track | Standard programming. |\n| SPI 106\u2013115 | \ud83d\udfe1 Developing Weakness | Add 1 supplemental station drill per week (10\u201315 min). |\n| SPI 116\u2013130 | \ud83d\udfe0 Significant Weakness | Add 2 supplemental station drills per week. Investigate root cause: is it a strength issue (sled), endurance issue (SkiErg/row), or technique issue (burpee broad jumps, wall balls)? |\n| SPI > 130 | \ud83d\udd34 Critical Weakness | Dedicate 3 sessions/week to this station for 3 weeks. Reduce general strength to maintenance. This station becomes the #1 training priority regardless of phase. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Environmental & Lifestyle Adaptation\n\n### 5.1 High Stress Week (Work, Life Events)\n\nThe AI detects this when the \"Life Stress\" sub-score in the Readiness Check averages \u2264 4 over 3+ consecutive days.\n\n| Action | Specification |\n|---|---|\n| Reduce weekly training volume by **25\u201330%** | Remove the lowest-priority session entirely. Shorten remaining sessions by 15\u201320%. |\n| Reduce high-intensity work by **40%** | Convert 1 HIIT session to Zone 2 cardio. Keep 1 quality session (the most important for current phase). |\n| Add recovery modalities | Prescribe 10-min post-session breathwork (box breathing: 4-4-4-4 cadence). Recommend magnesium supplementation and sleep hygiene review. |\n| Duration | Maintain modifications until Life Stress score returns to \u22656 for 2+ consecutive days. |\n\n### 5.2 Poor Sleep (<6 Hours)\n\nDetected via Sleep Quality sub-score \u2264 4, or direct athlete report.\n\n| Sleep Duration | Session Modification |\n|---|---|\n| 5\u20136 hours (1 night) | Reduce session intensity by 5\u201310%. Extend warm-up by 5 min. Proceed with caution; monitor mid-session RPE. |\n| <5 hours (1 night) | Downgrade session by one Readiness Tier (e.g., Green \u2192 Yellow). Cap session RPE at 7. |\n| <6 hours for 3+ consecutive nights | Apply Orange-tier modifications to ALL sessions until sleep normalizes. Add 1 rest day. Provide sleep hygiene education: consistent bedtime, no screens 1 hr before bed, cool bedroom (18\u201320\u00b0C), caffeine cutoff by 1:00 PM. |\n| <5 hours for 3+ consecutive nights | Red-tier: recovery sessions only until sleep improves. Investigate underlying cause (stress, medical, schedule). |\n\n### 5.3 Traveling (Limited Equipment)\n\nWhen the athlete flags travel status, the AI serves one of three **travel workout templates** based on available equipment:\n\n#### Hotel Gym (Treadmill + Dumbbells + Cable Machine)\n\n| Day | Session (30\u201340 min) |\n|---|---|\n| 1 | Treadmill intervals: 6 \u00d7 3 min at threshold pace / 2 min easy. DB lunges 3 \u00d7 12/leg. DB farmer's carry 3 \u00d7 40 m. |\n| 2 | Recovery: 20-min easy treadmill jog + 15-min mobility routine. |\n| 3 | DB circuit: 4 rounds of 10 goblet squats, 10 DB push press, 10 DB rows, 15 wall balls (sub: DB thrusters), 200-m treadmill run between rounds. |\n\n#### Bodyweight Only (Hotel Room / Park)\n\n| Day | Session (20\u201330 min) |\n|---|---|\n| 1 | AMRAP 20 min: 10 burpee broad jumps, 20 air squats, 15 push-ups, 200-m run (or 40 high knees). |\n| 2 | 30-min easy run at conversational pace (outdoor or treadmill). |\n| 3 | 4 \u00d7 4-min Tabata blocks (20 sec work / 10 sec rest): block 1 = jump squats; block 2 = mountain climbers; block 3 = walking lunges; block 4 = burpees. 2-min rest between blocks. |\n\n#### Minimal Equipment (Resistance Band + Jump Rope)\n\n| Day | Session (25\u201335 min) |\n|---|---|\n| 1 | Jump rope intervals: 8 \u00d7 1 min fast / 30 sec rest. Band pull-aparts 3 \u00d7 20. Band-resisted squats 3 \u00d7 15. Band rows 3 \u00d7 15. |\n| 2 | 25-min easy run + band-assisted stretching 10 min. |\n| 3 | Circuit: 5 rounds of 30-sec jump rope sprint, 10 band-resisted lunges per leg, 10 band push-ups, 15 band rows. 60-sec rest between rounds. |\n\n**Travel rule:** No more than 2 consecutive rest days while traveling. If equipment is zero, at minimum perform 20 min of bodyweight movement daily.\n\n### 5.4 Hot Weather Training (>30\u00b0C / 86\u00b0F)\n\nSupported by Periard et al. (2015, *Sports Med*) heat acclimatization guidelines.\n\n| Adjustment | Specification |\n|---|---|\n| Reduce running pace by **8\u201312%** for the first 5 sessions in heat | Allow cardiac drift without chasing normal pace. RPE should guide effort, not GPS pace. |\n| Reduce HIIT volume by **20%** for first week in heat | Add 30-sec additional rest between intervals. |\n| Hydration protocol | Pre-session: 500 ml water with electrolytes 2 hrs before. During: 200 ml every 15\u201320 min. Post: 1.5 \u00d7 body weight lost in fluid. |\n| Acclimatization timeline | After 7\u201310 sessions in heat, begin restoring normal pace/volume in 5% increments per session. Full acclimatization expected by 14 sessions (Racinais et al., 2015). |\n| RPE recalibration | Expect RPE to be 1\u20132 points higher than normal for same workload in heat. Do NOT adjust target RPE downward \u2014 use actual RPE to drive autoregulation normally. |\n\n### 5.5 Altitude Training (>1,500 m / 5,000 ft)\n\n| Altitude | Adjustment |\n|---|---|\n| 1,500\u20132,000 m | Reduce running pace by 5\u20138%. Reduce HIIT intensity by 10%. Expect RPE +1 for same effort. Allow 3\u20135 days for initial acclimatization. |\n| 2,000\u20132,500 m | Reduce running pace by 10\u201315%. Reduce all high-intensity volume by 20%. Increase hydration by 50%. Allow 7\u201310 days for acclimatization. Monitor SpO2 if possible. |\n| >2,500 m | Reduce all intensity by 15\u201320%. Limit sessions to 45 min for first 5 days. If SpO2 drops below 88% during exercise \u2192 stop and descend. |\n\n### 5.6 Return from Minor Illness Protocol\n\nBased on Elliott et al. (2020, *BJSM*) graduated return-to-play framework and Schwellnus et al. (2016) return-after-infection guidelines. The athlete must be symptom-free for \u226548 hours before beginning this protocol.\n\n| Day Post-Clearance | Session |\n|---|---|\n| Day 1 | 15-min easy walk + 10-min light stretching/mobility. Target RPE \u2264 3. |\n| Day 2 | 20-min easy jog or bike at HR < Zone 1 ceiling (< 65% max HR). Target RPE \u2264 4. |\n| Day 3 | 30-min Zone 2 run (RPE 4\u20135). If RPE \u2265 6 \u2192 return to Day 2 protocol for another day. |\n| Day 4 | 40-min session at 60% normal volume and 80% normal intensity. Include light strength (bodyweight or 50% normal loads). |\n| Day 5 | 50-min session at 75% normal volume, 90% normal intensity. |\n| Day 6 | Resume full programming if Readiness Score \u2265 7. If Readiness < 7, repeat Day 5. |\n\n**Hard rule:** If symptoms return at any stage \u2192 return to Day 1 and add 48 hours of rest. If fever occurs \u2192 medical clearance required before any exercise resumes.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Communication Templates\n\nThe AI coach uses these templates to explain adaptations clearly, building trust and compliance. Every message follows the **\"Observation \u2192 Reasoning \u2192 Action \u2192 Reassurance\"** framework.\n\n### Template 1: Elevated RPE Pattern\n\n> **\"I've noticed your RPE has been higher than expected this week.** Your last 3 sessions averaged RPE 8.2 against a target of 6.5. This tells me your body is accumulating more fatigue than planned \u2014 which is totally normal and happens to every athlete.\n>\n> **Here's what I'm adjusting:** I'm reducing your HIIT volume by 25% for the next session and swapping Thursday's tempo run for an easy Zone 2 run. This gives your body the recovery signal it needs without losing fitness.\n>\n> **You're not falling behind.** Strategic pullbacks like this are how the best athletes stay consistent across a 16-week block. We'll reassess at Monday's readiness check.\"\n\n### Template 2: Missed Session Restructure\n\n> **\"You missed Tuesday's HIIT session \u2014 no worries, life happens.** Since we're in Specific Prep, HIIT is our top priority this week. Here's how I've restructured your week:\n>\n> **Wednesday:** I've added a condensed 30-min HIIT block (4 rounds instead of 6) after your strength session. **Friday:** Stays as planned \u2014 your long run is still locked in. **Saturday's easy run:** Removed to give you recovery time after the compressed week.\n>\n> **Net result:** You'll still hit 80% of your planned weekly training stimulus. That's more than enough to keep progressing.\"\n\n### Template 3: Station Weakness Detected\n\n> **\"Your sled push time hasn't improved in 3 weeks** \u2014 you're at 3:45 for 50 m, while your tier target is 3:15. Your other stations have been improving steadily, so this is a specific weak link, not a fitness problem.\n>\n> **Here's my plan:** I'm adding two 15-min sled-focused sessions per week for the next 3 weeks. These include heavy sled pushes at short distances (3 \u00d7 15 m) for power, and full 50 m pushes at race weight for pacing. I've also added hip drive and quad-strengthening work (front squats, split squats).\n>\n> **Why this works:** Station-specific block training has been shown to produce faster improvements than general conditioning. We'll retest in 3 weeks.\"\n\n### Template 4: Deload Week Prescribed\n\n> **\"Your body is asking for a recovery week, and I'm listening.** Your readiness scores have averaged 5.8 for the past 14 days, and your session RPEs have been running 1.5 points above target. These are classic signs of accumulated fatigue.\n>\n> **This week's plan:** All sessions are reduced to 60% of normal volume. Intensity drops by 15%. Wednesday's HIIT becomes a 30-min easy bike or swim. I've added an extra rest day on Friday.\n>\n> **This isn't a step backward \u2014 it's a supercompensation opportunity.** Research shows that well-timed deload weeks lead to performance breakthroughs in the following block. You'll come back stronger.\"\n\n### Template 5: Goal Pace Reassessment\n\n> **\"Let's talk about your goal time.** Your last full simulation came in at 1:52:30, and your target is 1:30:00 \u2014 that's a 25% gap with 8 weeks remaining. While big improvements are possible, closing a gap this large requires us to be realistic.\n>\n> **My recommendation:** Let's reset your goal to 1:42:00, which represents a strong 10% improvement and keeps you on a sustainable trajectory. If you hit 1:42 ahead of schedule, we'll push further.\n>\n> **What changes:** I'm shifting your running pace zones to align with a 1:42 finish. I'm also adding a weekly half-sim to build race-specific conditioning faster. Let's crush this new target.\"\n\n### Template 6: Hot Weather Adjustment\n\n> **\"I see you're training in 33\u00b0C heat this week.** Your pace will naturally feel harder \u2014 that's not you getting weaker, it's your body redirecting blood to cool itself. It's physiology, not fitness loss.\n>\n> **Adjustments for this week:** All running paces drop by 10% (your 5:00/km tempo becomes 5:30/km). HIIT rest periods increase by 30 seconds. I need you drinking 500 ml with electrolytes 2 hours before each session and 200 ml every 15 minutes during.\n>\n> **Good news:** After 7\u201310 sessions in this heat, your body adapts and performance returns to normal. Heat training actually improves blood plasma volume \u2014 you'll be fitter for it.\"\n\n### Template 7: Return from Illness\n\n> **\"Welcome back! I know being sick is frustrating, but rushing back causes more problems than patience does.** Here's your 6-day return protocol:\n>\n> **Today (Day 1):** 15-min walk + 10-min gentle stretching. That's it. **Tomorrow:** 20-min easy jog, heart rate under 130 bpm. **Days 3\u20136:** Gradual ramp-up to full training.\n>\n> **The rule:** If at any point you feel worse than the day before, we pause and repeat the previous day's session. No exceptions. I'd rather have you 100% for the final 6 weeks than at 70% for 8 weeks.\"\n\n### Template 8: Positive Progress Acknowledgment\n\n> **\"Your benchmark results just came in, and they're excellent.** Your 5 km time dropped from 24:30 to 23:15 \u2014 that's a 5.1% improvement in 4 weeks. Your SkiErg dropped from 4:45 to 4:22. This tells me your aerobic engine is building exactly as planned.\n>\n> **What this unlocks:** I'm advancing your running intensity targets to Specific Prep levels starting this week. Your interval paces move from 4:50/km to 4:40/km. Everything else stays the same \u2014 no need to change what's working.\"\n\n### Template 9: Time-Compressed Session Served\n\n> **\"Got it \u2014 you only have 30 minutes today instead of 60. Here's your compressed session:**\n>\n> **3-min dynamic warm-up \u2192 22 min of today's main set at full intensity \u2192 5-min cool-down jog.** I've removed the accessories and shortened the warm-up, but the core training stimulus is preserved. Research shows that maintaining intensity with reduced volume still drives adaptation (Helms et al., 2018).\n>\n> **What you lose:** About 15% of today's training benefit. **What you keep:** 85% of the stimulus, and you stay on track. A 30-min session always beats a skipped session.\"\n\n### Template 10: Travel Workout Delivered\n\n> **\"I see you're traveling this week. I've built 3 hotel-friendly sessions that require only dumbbells and a treadmill:**\n>\n> **Session 1 (Mon):** Treadmill intervals + DB lunges + DB carries \u2014 35 min. **Session 2 (Wed):** Recovery jog + mobility flow \u2014 25 min. **Session 3 (Fri):** DB circuit mimicking Hyrox stations \u2014 30 min.\n>\n> **These sessions maintain your conditioning base without requiring any specialized equipment.** When you're back, we'll slot right back into the normal plan. Travel weeks are maintenance weeks, not growth weeks \u2014 and that's perfectly fine.\"\n\n### Template 11: Under-Training Flag\n\n> **\"I want to flag something positive: your RPE has been consistently below 5, and your readiness scores have been 8+ for 10 straight sessions.** This means either the training load isn't challenging enough, or you're in a great phase of adaptation.\n>\n> **Here's what I'm testing:** I'm adding 1 extra round to your next 2 HIIT sessions and bumping your running intervals by 5 sec/km faster. If your RPE stays under 6 after these changes, we'll make a larger adjustment.\n>\n> **This is a great 'problem' to have.** It means you're adapting faster than projected.\"\n\n### Template 12: ACWR Spike Warning\n\n> **\"Your training load has spiked over the past 7 days \u2014 your Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio is at 1.52, which puts you in an elevated injury-risk zone** (safe range is 0.8\u20131.3 per Gabbett, 2016).\n>\n> **Immediate adjustments:** I'm reducing your next 3 sessions by 20% volume. Tomorrow's HIIT drops from 6 rounds to 5. Thursday's run shortens from 8 km to 6.5 km. This brings your ACWR back to ~1.25 by Sunday.\n>\n> **This is protective, not punitive.** Load spikes are the #1 predictor of soft-tissue injury. A small pullback now protects weeks of training ahead.\"\n\n---\n\n## Appendix A: Research Citations Supporting This Framework\n\n| Principle | Key Research |\n|---|---|\n| RPE-based autoregulation outperforms fixed-load programming | Helms et al.
