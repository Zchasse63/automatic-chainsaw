Persist by Functional Bodybuilding (Marcus Filly)\n\n### Program Overview & Creator Background\n\nMarcus Filly is a six-time CrossFit Games athlete and longtime CrossFit affiliate owner who pivoted his training philosophy after experiencing severe burnout and physical breakdown following the 2016 CrossFit Games. That inflection point catalyzed the creation of **Functional Bodybuilding (FBB)**, an approach that blends traditional bodybuilding hypertrophy methods with functional movement patterns, controlled tempos, and an explicit emphasis on recovery and longevity.\n\nThe flagship program, **Persist**, is a subscription-based, self-guided training platform delivered through a web-based app (Atom Training). It is not available as a native mobile app but can be bookmarked and accessed through a browser. Persist is designed for intermediate to advanced lifters\u2014Filly and reviewers consistently note it is **not suited for true beginners** due to training volume and exercise complexity.\n\n**Pricing:**\n\n| Billing Cycle | Cost |\n|---|---|\n| Monthly | $39/month (includes 2-week free trial) |\n| Quarterly | $99/quarter |\n| Annual | $325/year |\n\n**Target Audience:** Experienced lifters seeking muscle growth, improved movement quality, mobility integration, and sustainable training. Athletes transitioning away from high-intensity CrossFit-style training. Home gym owners and commercial gym users alike.\n\n*Sources: Garage Gym Reviews Persist Review (2026); Functional Bodybuilding website; Marcus Filly YouTube channel.*\n\n### Core Philosophy\n\nPersist is built on several interlocking principles:\n\n1. **Progressive Overload Through Multiple Levers:** Rather than simply adding weight to the bar each week, Persist manipulates load, repetitions, volume, rest periods, range of motion, tempo, frequency, and degree of difficulty across 6-week training cycles. As Filly states: \"We typically don't use percentages of one rep maxes, but instead go by feel so that you can adapt to how you're feeling on a given day.\"\n\n2. **Controlled Tempo as a Core Tool:** Tempo prescriptions appear everywhere in FBB programming. A notation like **32X1** means: 3 seconds down, 2-second hold at the bottom, eXplode up, 1-second pause at the top. This enforces movement quality, increases time under tension, and drives hypertrophy without requiring maximal loads\u2014reducing injury risk.\n\n3. **Structured Effort Management (RPE-Based):** Rather than fixed percentages, Persist uses RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) and rep ranges. For example, a squat progression might call for building across sets at RPE 6 \u2192 7 \u2192 8, followed by a back-off set at 80% of the top weight for max reps. This allows athletes to auto-regulate daily.\n\n4. **Integrated Recovery:** Mobility and active recovery are not afterthoughts\u2014they are embedded into warm-ups, cool-downs, and 2\u20133 dedicated mobility sessions per week. Filly's personal experience with burnout drives this emphasis on sustainable training volume.\n\n5. **\"Look Good, Move Well\":** The stated goal of Persist is aesthetic and functional simultaneously\u2014building visible muscle while maintaining (or improving) joint health, mobility, and movement competence.\n\n*Sources: Garage Gym Reviews; Marcus Filly YouTube videos on tempo, training formats, and Pump Lift/Condition tracks.*\n\n### Weekly Template & Training Tracks\n\nPersist offers **five distinct tracks**, all running on **6-week training cycles** that build progressively. Athletes are encouraged to stay on one track for the full cycle. Future workouts are released one week at a time (via Sunday email previews), not all at once.\n\n| Track | Days/Week | Session Length | Focus | Conditioning Included? |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **Pillars** | 4 | ~60 min | Compound lifts (squat, bench, deadlift, OHP) + conditioning finishers | Yes (EMOMs, AMRAPs, burnout sets) |\n| **Pump Condition** | 5 | ~75 min | Hypertrophy-focused lifting + conditioning at end of most sessions | Yes |\n| **Pump Lift** | 5 | ~75 min | Pure hypertrophy, no conditioning | No |\n| **Perform** | 5 | ~90 min | Olympic lifts + functional fitness | Yes |\n| **Minimalist** | 5 | ~60 min | Minimal/no equipment workouts | Varies |\n\nAll tracks also include **2\u20133 dedicated mobility sessions** per week and **one full rest day**.\n\nA typical **Pillars** weekly structure (inferred from reviewer experience and Filly's content):\n\n| Day | Session Type |\n|---|---|\n| Monday | Pillars Workout A (Squat emphasis + conditioning finisher) |\n| Tuesday | Mobility/Recovery |\n| Wednesday | Pillars Workout B (Press emphasis + conditioning finisher) |\n| Thursday | Pillars Workout C (Deadlift/Hinge emphasis + conditioning finisher) |\n| Friday | Mobility/Recovery |\n| Saturday | Pillars Workout D (Upper body + conditioning finisher) |\n| Sunday | Full Rest |\n\n*Note: The exact day-by-day assignment varies by cycle. From the \"Persist Track Breakdown\" video, we know that within Pillars, specific lifts are assigned to specific days and progress over 6 weeks (e.g., deficit deadlifts on Tuesday for 6 weeks, long pause front squats on Wednesday for weeks 1\u20133 transitioning to max effort work by week 6).*\n\n*Sources: Garage Gym Reviews; Persist Track Breakdown YouTube video; Functional Bodybuilding Getting Started page.*\n\n### Session Structure\n\nEvery Persist workout follows a consistent architecture:\n\n1. **Warm-Up / Pre-Fatigue:** Light cardio (ski, row, run) plus movement-specific prep. Pre-fatigue targets the muscle groups of the day with higher-rep, lighter-load exercises (e.g., Bradford Z Press before a pressing session). Goal: prepare the body without fatiguing it enough to compromise the main lifts.\n\n2. **Strength Intensity (Main Lifts):** The core of the session. Compound movements with progressive overload protocols\u2014building sets, reverse pyramids, timed intervals, or RPE-based loading.\n\n3. **Strength Balance (Accessories):** Supersets or agonist pairings targeting smaller muscle groups (e.g., JM Press \u2192 Inverted Skull Crushers for triceps). Higher volume, moderate intensity, shorter rest periods.\n\n4. **Conditioning Finisher** (in applicable tracks): EMOMs, AMRAPs, or circuit-style work combining monostructural cardio with loaded movements.\n\n5. **Hypertrophy Finisher / Cool-Down:** Drop sets, isolation work, and/or stretching/mobility.\n\nA \"Short on Time\" note is provided for sessions over 60 minutes, typically reducing volume (e.g., 2 sets instead of 4) or cutting the conditioning section.\n\n### Representative Sample Workouts\n\n#### Sample 1: Pump Lift \u2014 Shoulders, Quads, Triceps Focus\n\n*(From Marcus Filly's YouTube: \"Muscle and Hypertrophy Workout - No Conditioning\")*\n\n| Section | Exercise | Sets \u00d7 Reps | Tempo | Rest / Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **Pre-Fatigue** | Ski + Row + Run (2 rounds) | 2 rounds | \u2014 | Light, blood flow |\n| | Bradford Z Press | 1\u20132 sets \u00d7 10\u201315 | \u2014 | Light, mobility-focused |\n| | Seated Calf Raise | 1\u20132 sets \u00d7 10\u201315 | 21X1 | \u2014 |\n| **Strength Intensity 1** | Smith/DB Incline Press (75\u00b0 incline) | 2 warm-up sets (15 reps, 10 reps) + 4 working sets \u00d7 8\u201310 | \u2014 | Every 2:00; RPE 8/10 on working sets |\n| **Strength Intensity 2** | Smith/KB Front Rack Drop Lunge | Every 75 sec \u00d7 8 sets (4/leg) \u00d7 8\u201310 reps | \u2014 | Alternating legs; ~2 min rest per working leg |\n| **Strength Balance** | JM Press \u2192 Inverted Skull Crusher (superset) | Every 3:00\u20133:30 \u00d7 3 sets; JM Press 5\u201310 reps, Skull Crusher 10\u201315 reps | \u2014 | 15\u201320 sec transition between movements |\n| **Hypertrophy Finisher** | Machine Leg Extension \u2192 DB Lateral Raise (superset) | 3 sets \u00d7 12\u201315 + 15\u201320; final set: drop set to failure | \u2014 | 90 sec rest between supersets; drop 30% on last set and go to failure again |\n\n#### Sample 2: Pump Condition \u2014 Pull Day\n\n*(From Marcus Filly's YouTube: \"Pump Condition Workout: Lift & Condition to Build More Muscle\")*\n\n| Section | Exercise | Sets \u00d7 Reps | Tempo | Rest / Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **Aerobic Bodybuilding** | Row 300m \u2192 Bent Over Rear Delt Fly \u00d7 10\u201315 \u2192 Dual KB Hang Clean High Pull \u00d7 10\u201315 | 4 rounds | \u2014 | Moderate pace; continuous |\n| **SuperSet 1 (Strength Intensity)** | T-Bar Row 6\u20138 reps \u2192 Max Reps Pull-Up to Failure (switch grips each set) | Every 3:30\u20134:00 \u00d7 4 sets | 21X0 (T-Bar Row) | 15 sec rest between exercises; rest remainder of interval |\n| **SuperSet 2 (Strength Balance)** | Incline Chest-Supported DB Elbowing Row \u00d7 12\u201316 \u2192 Alternating DB Curl \u00d7 16\u201320 (8\u201310/arm) | Every 90 sec \u00d7 8 total (4 sets each) | 20X0 (both) | Alternating exercises each 90 sec |\n| **Conditioning** | Row 12 Cal Sprint \u2192 6 KB Deadlifts (70 lb) \u2192 200 ft KB Farmers Walk \u2192 6 KB Deadlifts \u2192 12 Body Rows | Every 3:00 \u00d7 4 sets | \u2014 | ~2 min work, ~1 min rest per round |\n\n#### Sample 3: Back Squat Progression \u2014 Intensity + Back-Off Set\n\n*(From Marcus Filly's YouTube: \"3 Training Formats to Maximize Muscle\")*\n\n| Set | Reps | Tempo | RPE | Rest |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Warm-up sets (2\u20134) | Variable | 20X1 | Light | As needed |\n| Working Set 1 | 6 | 20X1 | 6/10 | Every 2:30 (running clock) |\n| Working Set 2 | 6 | 20X1 | 7/10 | Every 2:30 |\n| Working Set 3 (Top Set) | 6 | 20X1 | 8/10 | Every 2:30 |\n| Back-Off Set 4 | AMRAP | 20X0 (no pause at top or bottom\u2014continuous tension) | Max effort | \u2014 |\n\n*Back-Off Set uses 80% of Set 3 weight.

For Hyrox athletes who need to perform sled pushes, lunges, and wall balls under extreme fatigue, this foundation of movement quality is highly transferable. Poorly executed movement under fatigue leads to time loss and injury.\n- **Conditioning Integration (Pump Condition / Pillars):** The conditioning finishers\u2014especially those combining rowing, loaded carries, kettlebell work, and bodyweight movements in timed intervals\u2014have structural similarities to Hyrox station demands.\n- **Superset & Time-Domain Training:** Persist's use of EMOM, timed supersets, and every-X-minutes formats teaches pacing under metabolic stress\u2014a skill directly relevant to Hyrox transitions.\n- **Unilateral Work & Lunge Variations:** Extensive use of single-leg work (drop lunges, split squats) directly supports the lunge station in Hyrox.\n- **Farmers Carry & Loaded Movement:** Programmed regularly in conditioning sections.\n- **Recovery Architecture:** The embedded mobility sessions and sustainable volume approach help prevent the overtraining that often plagues athletes trying to balance multiple training modalities.\n\n**What's Missing:**\n\n- **No Running Programming:** Persist has zero dedicated running. For Hyrox, where athletes run 8 \u00d7 1 km between stations, this is a critical gap. Running accounts for roughly half of total Hyrox race time.\n- **No Hyrox-Specific Movements:** No sled push/pull, no wall balls, no rowing for calories (though rowing appears occasionally in conditioning), no burpee broad jumps, no ski erg intervals.\n- **Limited Aerobic Base Development:** While Pump Condition includes conditioning, it is not designed to build the sustained aerobic capacity needed for a 60\u201375 minute Hyrox race. The conditioning is supplementary, not primary.\n- **No Race-Specific Periodization:** Persist runs on continuous 6-week cycles with no taper, peak, or race-day preparation structure.\n\n**Key Programming Principles to Extract for an AI Coach:**\n\n1. **Tempo prescriptions as a tool for movement quality and injury prevention** (especially valuable during high-fatigue Hyrox training blocks).\n2. **RPE-based loading with rep ranges** rather than fixed percentages\u2014enables auto-regulation when combined with running fatigue.\n3. **The Pre-Fatigue \u2192 Strength Intensity \u2192 Strength Balance \u2192 Conditioning Finisher session architecture** is a transferable framework.\n4. **Agonist supersets for efficient volume accumulation** in time-constrained sessions.\n5. **Integrated mobility as a non-negotiable** training component, not an afterthought.\n6. **Progressive overload through varied stimuli** (tempo changes, range of motion, rest manipulation)\u2014not just load increases.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Nick Bare's Hybrid Athlete Approach\n\n### Creator Background\n\nNick Bare is a U.S. Army veteran (Infantry Platoon Leader, Ranger School graduate), founder of Bare Performance Nutrition (BPN), and arguably the most prominent figure in the hybrid athlete movement. His athletic resume includes a **2:48 marathon PR** (some sources cite 2:39), completion of the **Leadville 100-mile ultramarathon**, an **Ironman triathlon**, a **bodybuilding competition**, and a **9th place finish in the Hyrox Pro Division in Dallas** with a time of 1:05:42 (top 8% of all-time Hyrox Pro times).\n\nBare's origin story mirrors the hybrid athlete ethos: after leaving the military, he focused purely on bodybuilding/powerlifting and realized he was \"missing something vital\"\u2014cardiovascular conditioning and functional ability. He returned to running and has spent the years since 2018 developing his methodology for combining high-volume running with serious strength training.\n\nHis philosophy: **\"Hybrid athlete training is the best way to train. The reason it's the best lies directly in the results. Improved body composition, longevity, and it's sustainable.\"**\n\n*Sources: Nick Bare website (nickbare.com/training); Generation Iron profile; Men's Health interview; Playbook app program listing; John Get Strong Substack analysis.*\n\n### Training Philosophy\n\nBare's approach centers on several key principles:\n\n1. **Two-a-Days as the Default:** Morning runs and evening strength training, allowing the body to recover between modalities and giving each session proper focus.\n\n2. **Don't Add\u2014Replace:** When adding running to a strength program, Bare advises cutting lifting from 5 days to 3 and adding 2\u20133 running days, rather than simply piling on more total sessions. \"Whether you're just strength training or you're training hybrid, you need to start by deciding how many days you can truly commit to your workouts.\"\n\n3. **Start Slow, Build Gradually:** A recommended starting point is 4 training days per week, held for at least 4 weeks before adding a 5th day or two-a-day sessions.\n\n4. **Stimulate, Don't Obliterate:** Referenced repeatedly in his Hyrox preparation podcast (Episode 092), this principle emphasizes getting the training stimulus needed without destroying recovery capacity\u2014critical when managing concurrent running and lifting stress.\n\n5. **Auto-Regulation:** Bare emphasizes adjusting training based on how the body responds, especially during demanding preparation blocks.\n\n6. **Purposeful Training:** Every session should have a clear objective. \"Purpose-driven training sessions\" was a key lesson from his Hyrox preparation.\n\n*Sources: Men's Health hybrid training article; Nick Bare Podcast Episodes 092 and 100; Nick Bare website.*\n\n### Weekly Training Structure\n\nNick Bare's training structure has evolved over the years depending on his current goal (marathon, ultramarathon, Hyrox, general hybrid fitness). The research data provides two distinct snapshots:\n\n#### Current Training Split (October 2024 \u2014 Hyrox-Focused Phase)\n\n*(From YouTube: \"My Weekly Hybrid Athlete Training Split,\" Oct 31, 2024)*\n\n| Day | Morning Session | Afternoon Session |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Monday** | 10 easy miles | Hyrox circuit training |\n| **Tuesday** | \u2014 | Upper body strength + core |\n| **Wednesday** | Tempo or track workout (10\u201312 miles) | Lower body strength |\n| **Thursday** | 10 easy miles | Hyrox circuit training |\n| **Friday** | ~8 easy miles | Upper body strength + core |\n| **Saturday** | Long run + accessory work | \u2014 |\n| **Sunday** | 8\u201310 easy miles | \u2014 |\n\n**Weekly running mileage: ~65 miles/week**\n\nThis is an extremely high-volume training schedule reflecting Bare's advanced fitness level and years of progressive base building. The structure reveals several important design choices:\n\n- **Easy runs dominate:** 4 of the 6 running days are easy-pace efforts, consistent with the 80/20 polarized training model.\n- **Only one quality run session per week:** The Wednesday tempo/track workout is the sole high-intensity running session.\n- **Hyrox circuits appear twice weekly:** Monday and Thursday afternoons, providing sport-specific preparation.\n- **Strength training 3\u00d7 per week:** Upper/upper/lower split, prioritizing the sessions that support Hyrox performance.\n- **Sunday as a \"recovery run\" day:** Not a full rest day, but a lower-volume easy run without afternoon lifting.\n\n#### Hybrid Athlete 1.0 Program (General Hybrid Training Template)\n\n*(From Playbook app listing)*\n\n| Day | AM Session | PM Session |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Day 1** | Easy Run | Push Strength |\n| **Day 2** | Easy Run | Pull Strength |\n| **Day 3** | Interval Run | Lower Body Strength |\n| **Day 4** | Optional Aerobic Workout | Dedicated Mobility |\n| **Day 5** | Threshold Run | Upper Body Hypertrophy |\n| **Day 6** | Rest | Dedicated Mobility |\n| **Day 7** | Easy Run | Lower Body Hypertrophy |\n\n**Key differences from the Hyrox-focused split:** 5 weight training sessions vs. 3; 5 running workouts vs. 6\u20137; 2 dedicated mobility days; no sport-specific circuit work. This represents a more balanced, general-purpose hybrid template with roughly equal emphasis on strength and running.\n\n#### Marathon Training Block Periodization\n\n*(From Nebraska Food Cooperative PDF)*\n\nBare's marathon plans typically span **16\u201320 weeks** with the following structure:\n\n- **Weekly mileage:** Starts at 15\u201320 miles/week, builds to 40\u201350 miles/week at peak (weeks 12\u201314).\n- **Long runs:** Progressive, increasing ~10% per week, peaking at 20\u201322 miles before a taper.\n- **3 quality runs per week:** Track repeats (400m/800m intervals), tempo runs (75\u201385% max HR), and the long run.\n- **2 aerobic cross-training days:** Swimming, rowing, or stationary bike for endurance without running impact.\n- **Taper phase:** Reduced volume in final 2\u20133 weeks before race day.\n\n### Representative Sample Workouts / Training Days\n\n#### Sample Day 1: Hyrox-Phase Monday (Inferred from Oct 2024 Split)\n\n| Time | Session | Details |\n|---|---|---|\n| 5:00 AM | Easy Run | 10 miles at conversational pace |\n| PM | Hyrox Circuit | Sled push, sled pull, wall balls, burpee broad jumps, farmers carry, rowing \u2014 sport-specific preparation (exact prescriptions not publicly available) |\n\n#### Sample Day 2: Pull Strength (from Hybrid Athlete 1.0 / Generation Iron)\n\n| Exercise | Sets \u00d7 Reps | Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n| Pull-Ups | 4 \u00d7 AMRAP | Bodyweight |\n| Deadlifts | 3 \u00d7 5 | Heavy \u2014 heaviest possible with good form |\n| Lat Pulldowns | 4 \u00d7 8 | Superset format noted in BPN Training app |\n| Pendlay Rows | 4 \u00d7 12 | \u2014 |\n| Low Rows | 4 \u00d7 10 | \u2014 |\n| Dumbbell Rows | 4 \u00d7 10 | \u2014 |\n\n#### Sample Day 3: Chest Workout (from Generation Iron)\n\n| Exercise | Sets \u00d7 Reps | Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n| *Pre-Workout:* Concept2 Bike | 3 sets | Light; plus resistance band stretches, light DB rotations |\n| Bench Press | 4 \u00d7 8 | Heavy |\n| Incline Dumbbell Press | 4 \u00d7 5 | Heavy |\n| Superset: Seated Cable Fly + Push-Ups | 4 \u00d7 8 / 4 \u00d7 AMRAP | 60\u201390 sec rest between supersets |\n| Bodyweight Dips | 4 \u00d7 10 | \u2014 |\n\n#### Sample Day 4: Legs (from Generation Iron)\n\n| Exercise | Sets \u00d7 Reps | Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n| Leg Extensions | 4 \u00d7 12 | Warm-up / pre-fatigue |\n| Hamstring Curls | 4 \u00d7 10 | \u2014 |\n| Back Squats | 3 \u00d7 5 | Heavy |\n| Hack Squats | 4 \u00d7 8 | \u2014 |\n| Dumbbell Romanian Deadlifts | 4 \u00d7 10 | \u2014 |\n\n#### Sample Day 5: Long Run Day (Saturday, from multiple sources)\n\n| Component | Details |\n|---|---|\n| Long Run | 15\u201322 miles depending on training phase; progressive increase ~10%/week |\n| Pacing | Conversational for most; possible progression to marathon pace in final miles |\n| Accessory Work | Light accessory/mobility work post-run |\n\n*Note: Bare's Hyrox-specific circuit workout details are referenced in podcast episodes 092 and 100 but the exact exercise prescriptions, sets, reps, and rest periods are not publicly documented in the research data. The circuits are known to include sled push, sled pull, wall balls, burpee broad jumps, farmers carry, and rowing, mirroring the Hyrox race format.*\n\n### Hyrox Applicability Analysis\n\n**Nick Bare's hybrid model is arguably the closest existing public training template to what a Hyrox athlete needs.** His Hyrox Pro debut performance (1:05:42, 9th of 207 in Pro Division) validates the approach.\n\n**What Transfers Directly:**\n\n- **High Aerobic Base:** 65 miles/week of running provides an enormous aerobic engine. Hyrox is fundamentally an aerobic event lasting 60\u201390 minutes, and Bare's running volume builds exactly the metabolic capacity needed.\n- **Two-a-Day Structure:** The AM run / PM strength (or circuit) model maps directly onto Hyrox preparation, allowing sport-specific work and base building in the same day.\n- **Concurrent Strength + Endurance:** Bare has years of experience managing the interference effect between strength and endurance training. His solutions (separating sessions by 6+ hours, prioritizing recovery, auto-regulating intensity) are directly applicable.\n- **Hyrox Circuit Sessions:** Twice-weekly sport-specific circuits directly target the 8 Hyrox functional stations.\n- **Race Periodization Experience:** Bare has periodized for marathons (16\u201320 week blocks with progressive overload and taper), Ironman, and ultramarathons. This periodization knowledge translates to Hyrox race preparation.\n- **Mental Toughness & Pacing:** Bare's \"stimulate, don't obliterate\" philosophy and emphasis on purposeful training help prevent the overtraining that commonly derails Hyrox preparation.\n\n**What Could Be Improved for Hyrox:**\n\n- **Running Volume May Be Excessive:** 65 miles/week is far beyond what most Hyrox athletes need. Hyrox involves only 8 km total running. The high mileage reflects Bare's marathon background rather than Hyrox optimization. A more Hyrox-specific approach might reduce running to 25\u201340 miles/week and add more erg work (rowing, ski erg) and functional station practice.\n- **Strength Training Volume is Reduced:** In the Hyrox phase, Bare lifts only 3\u00d7/week (2 upper, 1 lower). For sled push/pull performance, which demands significant lower body and posterior chain strength, additional lower body strength work could be beneficial.\n- **Hyrox-Specific Weaknesses Identified:** As the John Get Strong analysis noted, Bare lost time on sled pull, burpees, rowing, and wall balls\u2014the more technical Hyrox-specific movements. More dedicated practice with these movements (beyond twice-weekly circuits) could improve performance.\n- **Public Program Lacks Specificity:** While Bare's personal training is well-documented via YouTube, the publicly available Hybrid Athlete 1.0 program on Playbook is a general hybrid template\u2014it does not include Hyrox-specific work.\n\n**Key Programming Principles to Extract for an AI Coach:**\n\n1. **AM/PM split for concurrent training** \u2014 separate running and strength by maximum time to minimize interference.\n2. **Polarized running distribution** \u2014 mostly easy runs with 1\u20132 quality sessions per week.\n3. **Progressive mileage building** \u2014 10% weekly increase, 16\u201320 week macrocycles, taper before competition.\n4. **\"Stimulate, don't obliterate\"** \u2014 manage training stress holistically across both modalities.\n5. **Auto-regulation as standard practice** \u2014 adjust based on recovery status, not rigid adherence to plan.\n6. **Sport-specific circuit training** \u2014 dedicate 2 sessions/week to practicing actual race movements in race-like conditions.\n7. **Four-day minimum starting point** for hybrid beginners, building to 5\u20136 days over 4+ weeks.\n8. **Strength training uses traditional bodybuilding rep schemes** (4 \u00d7 8\u201312 with heavy loads) \u2014 simple, proven, effective.\n\n---\n\n## 3. BPN (Bare Performance Nutrition) Community Training\n\n### Program Overview\n\nBare Performance Nutrition (BPN) is primarily a sports nutrition and supplement company founded by Nick Bare. In **February 2023**, BPN launched the **BPN Training app**, expanding beyond supplements into structured fitness programming. The app was positioned as a free, community-oriented training tool\u2014a significant differentiator in a market dominated by paid programs.\n\n**Key Details:**\n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---|---|\n| **Cost** | Free (unlimited access to all programming) |\n| **Programs Available** | 4 programs: Hybrid Athlete, 5K, Half Marathon, Marathon |\n| **Program Duration** | 12\u201316 weeks each |\n| **Program Creators** | Nick Bare and Jeff Cunningham |\n| **Platform** | Mobile app (BPN Training) |\n| **Integration** | Garmin Connect compatibility for health/fitness data syncing |\n| **Content** | Exercise library with video demonstrations, educational articles on fitness and nutrition |\n\n*Sources: BusinessWire press release (Feb 2023); Silicon UK press release; BPN website; BPN Training app listing.*\n\n### Training Philosophy\n\nBPN Training's philosophy extends directly from Nick Bare's personal training ethos, packaged for broader accessibility:\n\n- **\"Go One More\":** BPN's motivational tagline, encouraging athletes to push beyond perceived limits.\n- **\"Prove Yourself Right\":** A 2023 campaign encouraging commitment to physically challenging goals.\n- **Personalization:** Programs adapt based on fitness data (via Garmin Connect integration), adjusting to the user's fitness level over time.\n- **Accessibility:** The decision to make all programming free reflects a philosophy that quality training should not be gated behind paywalls. As Nick Bare stated: \"There aren't great training programs available that provide personalized, quality resources at no cost.\"\n- **Holistic Approach:** BPN Training encompasses not just workouts but also nutritional guidance, recovery strategies, and mental well-being components.\n\n### Available Programming\n\nThe four programs represent a progression from running-specific to hybrid:\n\n1. **5K Program** (12\u201316 weeks): Entry-level running program for beginners building toward a 5K race.\n2. **Half Marathon Program** (12\u201316 weeks): Intermediate running progression.\n3. **Marathon Program** (12\u201316 weeks): Advanced marathon preparation following Nick Bare's methodology.\n4. **Hybrid Athlete Program** (12\u201316 weeks): The flagship program combining running and strength training\u2014structurally similar to the Hybrid Athlete 1.0 program available on Playbook.\n\nThe Hybrid Athlete program on BPN Training follows a **Push/Pull/Lower** strength training split combined with running workouts. From the limited public footage available (YouTube: \"First pull workout of the Hybrid Training Program on the new BPN Training App\"), we know:\n\n- Workouts include supersets (e.g., lat pulldown superset with low rows on pull day).\n- The app provides supplement recommendations tied to each workout (e.g., Endo Pump and Flight pre-workout for a pull session).\n- Exercise demonstrations with detailed instructions are provided within the app.\n\n### Representative Sample Workouts\n\n**Important caveat:** The BPN Training app's full workout prescriptions are not publicly documented in the research data. The app is free but requires download and account creation to access full programming. Below is what can be reconstructed from available sources:\n\n#### Sample 1: Hybrid Athlete \u2014 Pull Day (from BPN Training app YouTube)\n\n| Exercise | Format | Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n| Lat Pulldown | Superset with Low Row | Reps/sets not publicly specified |\n| Low Row | Superset with Lat Pulldown | \u2014 |\n| Additional pulling movements | \u2014 | Full workout visible only in-app |\n\n*This is incomplete\u2014the YouTube video shows fragments of the workout but does not document the full prescription.*\n\n#### Sample 2: Hybrid Athlete \u2014 Push Day (from Hybrid Athlete 1.0 on Playbook / YouTube \"Block 2\")\n\n*(Inferred from program structure\u2014the BPN app's Hybrid Athlete program appears to follow similar programming to Bare's Playbook version)*\n\n| Exercise | Sets \u00d7 Reps | Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n| Push-day exercises (bench press variations, dumbbell presses, dips, etc.) | 4 \u00d7 8\u201312 typical | \"There's not gonna be bench press involved\" in Block 2 push day\u2014indicating exercise rotation across blocks |\n\n#### Sample 3: Hybrid Athlete \u2014 Weekly Structure (from Playbook listing)\n\nThis is the same weekly template documented under Nick Bare's section:\n\n| Day | AM | PM |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1 | Easy Run | Push Strength |\n| 2 | Easy Run | Pull Strength |\n| 3 | Interval Run | Lower Body Strength |\n| 4 | Optional Aerobic | Dedicated Mobility |\n| 5 | Threshold Run | Upper Body Hypertrophy |\n| 6 | Rest | Dedicated Mobility |\n| 7 | Easy Run | Lower Body Hypertrophy |\n\n### Additional Features\n\n- **Exercise Library:** Comprehensive, with video demonstrations and written instructions for proper form.\n- **Educational Content:** Articles and guides on fitness and nutrition written by industry experts.\n- **Community Component:** Online community for motivation and accountability.\n- **Tracking:** Workout logging, progress tracking with sharing capabilities.\n- **Scalability:** Programs include beginner and intermediate/advanced versions for running workouts.\n\n### Hyrox Applicability Analysis\n\n**What Transfers:**\n\n- **Hybrid Athlete Framework:** The BPN Hybrid Athlete program provides a solid general template for concurrent strength and running training\u2014the foundation of any Hyrox preparation program.\n- **Free Access + Garmin Integration:** The zero-cost model and Garmin Connect compatibility make it an accessible entry point for athletes exploring hybrid training.\n- **Running Program Expertise:** The 5K, Half Marathon, and Marathon programs demonstrate structured running periodization knowledge that supports the aerobic development needed for Hyrox.\n- **Community & Accountability:** The social/community features support long-term adherence.\n\n**What's Missing \u2014 A Significant Gap:**\n\n- **No Hyrox-Specific Programming:** As of the available data, BPN Training does not offer a Hyrox-specific program. The four available programs (Hybrid Athlete, 5K, Half Marathon, Marathon) do not include sled push/pull, wall balls, burpee broad jumps, ski erg, or any of the 8 Hyrox functional fitness stations.\n- **Limited Public Workout Detail:** Despite being free, the full workout prescriptions are only visible within the app itself. The research data does not provide enough detail to fully evaluate the quality of the programming (tempo prescriptions, progressive overload structure, periodization model).\n- **No Conditioning/Functional Fitness Integration:** The Hybrid Athlete program appears to separate running and strength training cleanly\u2014there is no equivalent to Persist's conditioning finishers or Bare's Hyrox circuit sessions.\n- **General-Purpose Design:** The programs are designed for broad accessibility, not competition-specific preparation. This makes them valuable for building a base but insufficient for direct Hyrox preparation.\n\n**Key Programming Principles to Extract for an AI Coach:**\n\n1. **Free, accessible programming as an onboarding mechanism** \u2014 lower barriers to entry for beginners.\n2. **Garmin Connect / wearable integration** for adaptive programming based on real physiological data.\n3. **Scaled programming versions** (beginner vs. intermediate/advanced) within the same program structure.\n4. **Supplement integration as a value-add** (relevant for a commercial coaching product, though secondary to training quality).\n5. **Push/Pull/Lower split** as a proven, simple strength training framework for hybrid athletes.\n\n---\n\n## Comparative Summary: Hyrox Readiness Matrix\n\n| Dimension | Persist (Filly) | Nick Bare Hybrid | BPN Training |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Running Development** | \u274c None | \u2705\u2705\u2705 Elite-level (65 mi/wk) | \u2705\u2705 Structured programs (5K\u2013Marathon) |\n| **Strength/Hypertrophy** | \u2705\u2705\u2705 Primary focus | \u2705\u2705 Solid but reduced in race phases | \u2705\u2705 Push/Pull/Lower framework |\n| **Hyrox-Specific Stations** | \u274c None | \u2705\u2705 2\u00d7/week circuits (personal training) | \u274c None |\n| **Conditioning/Metabolic** | \u2705\u2705 Pump Condition, Pillars finishers | \u2705 Via running + circuits | \u274c Not documented |\n| **Movement Quality/Tempo** | \u2705\u2705\u2705 Core philosophy | \u2705 Basic warm-ups | \u2705 Video demos in library |\n| **Recovery/Mobility** | \u2705\u2705\u2705 2\u20133 sessions/week embedded | \u2705 Dedicated mobility days | \u2705 Dedicated mobility days |\n| **Periodization** | \u2705\u2705 6-week cycles | \u2705\u2705\u2705 16\u201320 week race blocks with taper | \u2705\u2705 12\u201316 week programs |\n| **Auto-Regulation** | \u2705\u2705\u2705 RPE-based, rep ranges | \u2705\u2705 Emphasized in philosophy | \u2705 Garmin-adaptive |\n| **Accessibility/Cost** | $39\u2013325/yr; web-based | Playbook app (subscription) | Free |\n| **Beginner-Friendly** | \u274c Not recommended | \u2705 Scaled versions available | \u2705\u2705 Designed for all levels |\n\n## Synthesis: Key Principles for an AI Hyrox Coach\n\nDrawing across all three programs, the following principles emerge as foundational for an AI coaching system targeting Hyrox preparation:\n\n1. **Concurrent Training Architecture (from Bare):** AM/PM splits separating running from strength/circuits; polarized running distribution (80% easy / 20% quality); progressive mileage building with taper.\n\n2. **Movement Quality & Tempo Control (from Filly):** Tempo prescriptions for injury-proofing and muscle development; RPE-based auto-regulation rather than fixed percentages; structured session architecture (warm-up \u2192 main lift \u2192 accessories \u2192 conditioning).\n\n3. **Sport-Specific Circuit Integration (from Bare's Hyrox phase):** 2\u00d7 weekly Hyrox-specific circuit sessions practicing actual race movements (sled push/pull, wall balls, burpee broad jumps, farmers carry, rowing, ski erg) in race-simulated conditions.\n\n4. **Progressive Overload Through Multiple Variables (from Filly):** Load, reps, tempo, rest, range of motion, and exercise complexity as independent levers for progression\u2014not just weight on the bar.\n\n5. **Recovery as a First-Class Training Component (from Filly + Bare):** Dedicated mobility sessions, embedded warm-up/cool-down protocols, and the \"stimulate, don't obliterate\" philosophy to manage the uniquely high demands of concurrent training.\n\n6. **Adaptive Scaling (from BPN):** Programming that adjusts to user fitness level, with beginner/intermediate/advanced versions of the same framework, enabled by wearable data integration.\n\n7. **Periodization for Race Day (from Bare):** 16\u201320 week macrocycles with progressive volume building, peak training at weeks 12\u201314, and a structured taper phase\u2014adapted from marathon methodology to suit the Hyrox competitive calendar.\n\nAn effective AI Hyrox coach would synthesize Filly's session design sophistication and movement quality emphasis with Bare's concurrent training framework and race periodization experience, while incorporating the accessibility and adaptive scaling principles demonstrated by BPN Training. The critical addition that none of these programs fully provides is a **purpose-built Hyrox periodization model** that systematically develops all 8 functional stations alongside the running demands, progressing from general physical preparation through sport-specific training to race-day peaking.",
