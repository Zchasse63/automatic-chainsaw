Today, I\u2019d like to get even more specific and take a look at four major signs of overtraining, which include 1. change in resting heart rate (RHR), 2. change in blood count levels, 3. reduced heart rate variability (HRV), and 4. hitting a training plateau.\n\n## 1. Increase in Resting Heart Rate\n\nExperiencing an elevated resting heart rate (RHR) for an extended period of time is a good indicator of fatigue. Generally speaking, an athlete\u2019s resting heart rate will become lower as their fitness level increases, indicating more efficient heart function and better cardiovascular fitness. To see fluctuations in your athletes\u2019 resting heart rate, navigate to their TrainingPeaks calendar and click on a \u201cMetrics\u201d card. If they wear a wearable that syncs with TrainingPeaks and have a Premium account, this card will allow you to visualize how their resting heart rate has changed over time in an easy-to-read graph.\nOn the other hand, if your athletes are regularly tracking their resting heart rate and see an unusual increase, then this may mean they\u2019re too fatigued and need rest. It is completely normal to have an elevated heart rate after a hard training day. Usually, an RHR 5 bpm above their average indicates they need more recovery time. However, if their resting heart rate doesn\u2019t stabilize and remains elevated for multiple weeks, then it could mean they\u2019re overtrained or even developing an illness or medical condition.",

As expected, the creatine-supplemented group exhibited significantly greater gains in 1RM strength (bench press and squat) compared to the placebo group over the training period.\nNotably, the combined creatine + \u03b2-alanine group demonstrated similar strength improvements to the creatine-only group, with both supplement conditions significantly outperforming the placebo in 1RM gains. However, there was no statistically significant difference in strength gains between the combination group and creatine-only group, suggesting that \u03b2-alanine did not provide additional benefits for maximal strength beyond the established ergogenic effects of creatine. These findings indicate that, in the context of resistance-trained male athletes, creatine is the primary contributor to maximal strength improvements, while \u03b2-alanine does not further enhance 1RM performance when training and diet are controlled.\n\n\u2026\n\nAs expected, the placebo group experienced performance decrements across sprints in both pre- and post-supplementation tests, indicating fatigue accumulation. In contrast, the creatine-only group exhibited significant improvements in peak power output during the second and third sprints, suggesting better maintenance of anaerobic power over repeated efforts. However, the \u03b2-alanine + creatine group showed an additional advantage, as they significantly increased mean power output across all three sprints\u2014an improvement not observed in placebo or \u03b2-alanine-only conditions.\nFurthermore, the fatigue index (rate of power decline across sprints) remained stable in groups receiving \u03b2-alanine, indicating reduced fatigue accumulation. These findings suggest that while creatine improves peak power, \u03b2-alanine contributes to sustained power output and mitigates fatigue in repeated high-intensity efforts.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe authors concluded that \u03b2-alanine was effective in delaying neuromuscular fatigue, while creatine did not contribute meaningfully to this endurance-related outcome. These findings reinforce the notion that \u03b2-alanine\u2019s buffering capacity plays a crucial role in sustaining high-intensity effort, whereas creatine\u2019s role in endurance-type performance is minimal.\n\n\u2026\n\n### 4.3. Body Composition\n\nCreatine supplementation is well established for its role in increasing LBM, primarily through enhanced intracellular water retention, improved strength, and greater progressive overload during resistance training [4,33]. In contrast, \u03b2-alanine\u2019s potential effects on body composition are more indirect, hypothesized to occur through increased training volume and higher-intensity efforts, leading to greater hypertrophic adaptation. The proposed synergy between these two supplements is that creatine enhances maximal strength, while \u03b2-alanine delays fatigue, allowing for a higher training volume\u2014thereby providing both a heavier and a slightly prolonged training stimulus.",

The subsidiary aim was to determine whether exercise-heat tolerance would further improve following 7-Weeks post-exercise sauna bathing.\n\n\u2026\n\nOnly peak *T*~rec~ (\u2212 0.1 \u00b0C; *p* = 0.03 decreased further from 3-Weeks to 7-Weeks in SAUNA (other physiological variables *p* > 0.05).\n\n### Conclusions\n\nThree-weeks post-exercise sauna bathing is an effective and pragmatic method of heat acclimation, and an effective ergogenic aid. Extending the intervention to seven weeks only marginally improved *T*~rec~.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of adding intermittent post-exercise sauna bathing to normal endurance training to induce heat acclimation adaptations in trained athletes, and to determine the impact of these adaptations on maximal and submaximal exercise performance markers in temperate conditions. We hypothesised that intermittent post-exercise sauna bathing would: (1) elicit hallmark heat acclimation adaptations and improve thermoregulation during exercise heat stress more than endurance training alone, and (2) improve physiological markers of exercise performance in temperate conditions to a greater extent than endurance training alone.\n\n\u2026\n\nA battery of experimental trials was completed within a 1-week timeframe at baseline (Pre), following 3\u00a0weeks (3-Weeks) and following 7\u00a0weeks (7-Weeks) of either normal endurance training (CON) or normal endurance training with the post-exercise sauna bathing intervention (SAUNA). Experimental trials included a running heat tolerance test (HTT), a temperate exercise test (consisting of a lactate profile test to determine running speed at 4\u00a0mmol\u00a0L^\u22121^ [La^\u2212^] and a VO~2max~ test) and a resting venous blood sample.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe main findings of this study are that 3\u00a0weeks of post-exercise sauna bathing induced heat acclimation adaptations (reduced HR, *T*~rec~ and *T*~sk~, and increased sweat gland activity), and improved markers of exercise performance in temperate conditions (i.e., VO~2max~, running speed at 4 mmol L^\u22121^ [La^\u2212^] and TTE), to a greater extent than endurance training alone.\nThese improvements were consistent with the study hypothesis. Following 7 weeks of post-exercise sauna bathing, *T*~rec~ was the only physiological variable measured during the HTT that showed further improvements. However, the additional 0.1 \u00b0C reduction in peak *T*~rec~ from 3-Weeks to 7-Weeks may not be physiologically meaningful.\nWhilst participants did adhere well to the intervention, the dropout rate was high (51%; mainly due to injuries acquired during normal training in both groups). This drop-out rate was an important finding in-and-of-itself as it highlights the difficulty of implementing a 7-week long heat acclimation protocol in addition to the training programme of competitive endurance runners.",

Many of these studies examine \u201celite athletes\u201d (e.g., Olympians, professionals, and/or players recruited to national and varsity teams) and some focus on athletes in general. Despite all the efforts expended, by any definition, numerous athletes still experience inadequate sleep (Lucidi, Lombardo, Russo, Devoto & Violani, 2007; Samuels., 2008; Swinbourne, Gill, Vaile & Smart., 2016). Compared to non-athletes, athletes tend to sleep less on average (Leeder, Glaister, Pizzoferro, Dawson & Pedlar, 2012). Furthermore, athletes\u2019 quality of sleep appears to be lower than their non-athlete peers (Bleyer, Barbosa, Andrade, Teixeira & Felden., 2015; Tsunoda & al., 2015). Additionally, it has been suggested that certain types of athletes are more prone to developing sleep difficulties such as sleep apnea. For example, according to George, Kab & Levy (2003) and Albuquerque & al., (2010), National Football League (NFL) players have higher rates of obstructive sleep apnea, which has tremendous deleterious impacts on health and daytime sleepiness. Notably, there is increasing evidence that poor sleep is a good predictor for injuries and more importantly, concussion (Raikes, Athey, Alfonso-Miller, Killgore & Grandner, 2019).\n\n### Position Statements\n\nRecently, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), has addressed, for the first time, sleep as a major contributor to athletic performance and as a fundamental feature of athlete mental health (Reardon & al., 2019). In addition, the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) included sleep health as part of their published mental health best practices (Kroshus & al., 2019), as well as their more recently published official position statement on the importance of sleep health for student athletes (Kroshus & al., 2019). These position statements from the NCAA and IOC represent the increased awareness of the importance of sleep health among organizations of elite athletes. Both of these documents were the result of a literature review, delphi process of iterative consensus-building, and subsequent revision, following exhaustive reviews of available literature.\n\nThe IOC mental health document (Reardon, et al., 2019) considers sleep health in terms of sufficiency (i.e., at least 7 hours for adults), proper circadian alignment, good overall perceived sleep quality, and absence of sleep disorders including insomnia disorder and sleep apnea. The document recommends that these dimensions of sleep be considered important for mental health, as well as physical health and functioning. Further, the document recommends education, proper assessment and screening, and treatment using evidence-based strategies \u2013 given the consideration that some treatments may impact safety and/or performance.\n\nThe NCAA document focused on sleep as an important aspect of health, performance, and mental functioning in collegiate student athletes (Kroshus et a., 2019). It addresses many identified barriers to sleep, including academic, athletic, and social time demands. Similarly, this document defines sleep health in terms of duration (at least 7 hours in adults), timing, overall quality, and absence of disorders including insomnia and sleep apnea. Particular attention is also paid to the role of tiredness, fatigue, and/or sleepiness as consequences of sleep loss and/or disturbances. The NCAA makes 5 recommendations in this document:\n\n1. Conduct a collegiate athlete time demands survey annually.\n2. Recommendation 2: Ensure that consumer sleep technology, if used, is compliant with Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) laws.\n3. Recommendation 3: Incorporate sleep screening into the preparticipation exam.\n4. Recommendation 4: Provide collegiate athletes with evidence-based sleep education that includes: (1) information on sleep best practices; (2) information about the role of sleep in optimising athletic and academic performance and overall well-being; and (3) strategies for addressing sleep barriers.\n5. Recommendation 5: Provide coaches with evidence-based sleep education that includes: (1) information on sleep best practices; (2) information about the role of sleep in optimising athletic and academic performance and overall well-being; and (3) strategies to help optimise collegiate athlete sleep.\n\nThese efforts specifically recommend that sleep-related education should be provided, sleep difficulties and disorders should be routinely assessed and screened for, and sleep health promotion should be a goal of athletics programs.\n\n## EPIDEMIOLOGY OF SLEEP DISTURBANCES IN ATHLETES\n\n### Prevalence of Insufficient Sleep\n\nInsufficient sleep duration can impact metabolism, endocrine function, athletic and cognitive outcomes, and, furthermore, increase perceived effort during exercise (Chase & al., 2017; Spiegel, Leproult & Van Cauter, 1999; Spiegel & al., 2004). When athletes are compared to non-athletes, they tend to sleep less and less efficiently. Leeder, Glaister, Pizzoferro, Dawson & Pedlar, (2012) compared the habits of 47 elite athletes over a four-day period to a group of non-athletes, using actigraphy; age of participants were not reported, but groups were matched for age and gender. On average, athletes slept 6.55 \u00b1 0.43 vs 7.11 \u00b1 0.25 hours in the non-athletes (*p* = 0.27). However, they did report lower sleep efficiency (80.6 \u00b1 6.4 vs 88.7 \u00b1 3.6., *p* < 0.05), higher time spent in bed (8:07 \u00b1 0:20 vs 8:36 \u00b1 0:.53., *p* < 0.05), wake after sleep onset (0:50 \u00b1 0:16 vs 1:17 \u00b1 0:31., *p* < 0.05), sleep onset latency (5.0 \u00b1 2.5 vs 18.2 \u00b1 16.5., *p* < 0.05) and sleep fragmentation (29.8 \u00b1 9.0 vs 36.0 \u00b1 12.4., *p* < 0.05) in athletes. Furthermore, Lastella, Roach, Halson & Sargent (2015) reported insufficient sleep duration among athletes, with 6.8 hours on average. Sargent, Lastella, Halson & Roach (2014) also reported that over 14 nights assessed with actigraphy, athletes recorded an average of 6.5 hours of sleep per night.\n\nTaken together, these studies have investigated a total of 241 elite athletes and documented actigraphically-determined sleep durations of about 6 and a half hours in most cases. Recently, Mah and colleagues (2018) indicated that 39.1% of athletes reported insufficient sleep (< 7 hours) by self-report. And among a large sample of collegiate athletes in the US (N=8,312), Turner and colleagues reported that the mean number of nights per week that athletes did not think they got enough sleep was 3.8 (Turner et al 2019).\n\n### Prevalence of poor sleep quality\n\nHoshikawa, Uchida & Hirano (2018) investigated the quality of sleep of 817 Japanese elites\u2019 athletes with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), showing that 28% of the participants exhibit a score > 5, suggesting poor quality of sleep. Mah and colleagues (2018) reported that 42.2% of the 629 athletes in that study experienced poor sleep quality, also using the PSQI. In 2019, Turner and colleagues examined data from N=8,312 collegiate student athletes and found that 19.8% reported that \u201csleep difficulties\u201d were particularly \u201ctraumatic or difficult to handle\u201d over the past 12 months and that 21.8% reported extreme difficulty falling asleep at least 3 nights per week (Turner & al., 2019). Bleyer and colleagues reported that 38% of their 452 participants reported poor sleep (Bleyer, Barbosa, Andrade, Teixeira & Felden, 2015). Findings from a study conducted among elite rugby and cricket players (n = 175) showed that 50% of their participants\u2019 PSQI score were > 5, and that 9% scored > 10 (Swinbourne, Gill, Vaile & Smart, 2016). Tsunoda and colleagues (2015) reported the PSQI scores of 14 wheelchair basketball athletes (mean = 5.8 \u00b1 3.0) and compared their results with 103 non-athletes from the general population (mean = 4.51 \u00b1 2.14). Regardless of total sleep time, the wheelchair athletes reported lower sleep quality and lower sleep efficiency than matched non-athletes.\n\nIn a cohort of 317 Rio Olympic athletes from eleven different sports, poor sleep quality (as assessed by the PSQI) was prevalent in more than 50% of the athletes following the Olympic Games (Drew & al., 2018). This recapitulates the earlier results with a similar cohort, in which up to 83% of athletes reach the cutoff indicating poor sleep (Drew & al., 2017). Of note, the higher proportion with a score >5 occurred in the leadup to the Olympics and the lower figure was recorded at the Games. Consequently, regardless of the type of sports, these results highlight the prevalence of poor sleep quality among athletes.\n\n### Prevalence of Daytime Sleepiness\n\nFew studies have examined the prevalence of general fatigue and/or sleepiness among athletes. Turner and colleagues (2019) reported that 60.9% of collegiate athletes report that they experience feeling \u201ctired, dragged out, or sleepy during the day\u201d at least 3 days per week (as measured by self-report). Furthermore, 32.75% of these collegiate student athletes reported an inability to maintain wakefulness at least 3 times per week (by self-report). Mah and colleagues (2018) reported that 51% of student athletes in their study reported high scores (>=10) on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. These findings indicate high levels of sleepiness in elite athletes.\n\n### Prevalence of circadian preferences and disruption\n\nData exploring chronotype among the general population suggest that about 25% are morning type, 50% are intermediate types and about 25% are evening types (Fischer, Lombardi, Marucci-Wellman & Roenneberg, 2017). Very few studies have explored the chronotype distribution among athletes. Two studies (Samuels, 2008; Silva & al., 2012) indicated that 51% of athletes were classified as morning types, 40% as intermediate types and only 9% were classified as evening types. One study examined athletes in wheelchairs and the other examined school-age athletes and may not be representative of the elite athlete population. Lastella, Roach, Halson & Sargent (2016) investigated 114 elite athletes emerging from 5 different sports. Their results indicated that 28% were morning types, 65% were intermediate types and only 6% were evening types, supporting previous findings that athletes tend to pursue and excel in sports that match their chronotype (Lastella, Roach, Hurem & Sargent, 2010).\n\nCircadian rhythms can influence variations in performance, depending on the time of day and typical training schedules, which ultimately can affect competitive performance (Drust, Waterhouse, Atkinson, Edwards & Reilly, 2005). When athletes experience disturbances in their environments or routines such as overnight travel, repetitive time zone changes, evening training or late-night competition, endogenous circadian rhythms and normal sleep patterns may be out of synchrony (Beersma & Gordijn, 2007; Reilly & Edwards, 2007). Such disruptions in circadian and sleep patterns can increase homeostatic pressure and thus influence the regulation of emotions, body temperature, circulation of melatonin, and cause a significant increase in sleep latency (Lack & Wright, 2007). The sleep/wake behavior of athletes is often governed by their training schedule (Lastella, Roach, Halson, Martin, West & Sargent, 2015). Therefore, the role of chronotype among athletes may interact with the training schedule and should be considered to optimize training and performance (Drust, Waterhouse, Atkinson, Edwards & Reilly, 2005) and reduce the prevalence of chronobiologic disturbances.\n\n### Prevalence of sleep disorders\n\n#### Insomnia\n\nGupta, Morgan & Gilchrist (2017) demonstrated that the relation between elite sport participation and insomnia symptomology is poorly systematized. Daytime impairment \u2013 a key part of insomnia diagnosis \u2013 can reflect a wide variety of experiences including fatigue, emotional fluctuation, and psychomotor and/or neuropsychological performance, which all are important for elite athletes. Given this particular sensitivity to performance impairment and high levels of sleepiness (which is not common in insomnia), there arise some challenges in insomnia assessment among elite athletes. Traditional insomnia models might poorly discriminate insomnia *per se* in this non-traditional population (Samuels, James, Lawson & Meeuwisse, 2016). The multifaceted demands of elite sport including a high level of training volume (Collette, Kellmann, Ferrauti, Meyer & Pfeiffer, 2018; Sargent, Halson & Roach, 2014), pre-competition anxiety (Erlacher, Ehrlenspiel, Adegbesan & Galal El-Din, 2011; Lastella & al., 2015) circadian challenges (jet lag) (Samuels, 2012) can all predispose and precipitate sleep disturbance, thus leading to or facilitating symptomology of insomnia.\n\nGiven the absence of a validated sleep questionnaire specifically for athletes before the creation of the Athlete Sleep Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ) (Bender, Lawson, Werthner & Samuels, 2018), it is difficult to precisely indicate the insomnia prevalence in elite athletes. However, the systematic review conducted by Gupta Morgan & Gilchrist (2017) reported that sleep disturbance complaints range from 13 to 70% of the athletes and that overall, on average, 26% of the athletes significantly scored for insomnia symptoms using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire Index (PSQI). It should be noted that notwithstanding the popularity of these two questionnaires, none of them are specifically validated in an elite athlete population. Elite athletes are primarily selected on the basis of physiological predisposition but also psychological attributes (Allen, Greenlees & Jones, 2013). It is possible that personality traits that include a focus on success (e.g., perfectionism) may also predispose an elite athlete to insomnia (Harvey, Gehrman & Espie, 2014). Furthermore, the demands of elite sports, including an elevated frequency, intensity, and volume of activity and scheduling challenges (Sargent, Lastella, Halson & Roach, 2014; Sargent, Halson & Roach, 2014), coupled with pre-competition anxiety (Erlacher, Ehrlenspiel, Adegbesan & Galal El-Din, 2011) and jetlag/travel (Fowler, Duffield, Howle, Waterson & Vaile, 2015; Fowler, Duffield, Lu, Hickmans & Scott, 2016), all these factors may lead an individual toward sleep difficulties. Given that these challenges are uncommon among the general population and the relationship between risk factors and sleep may be fundamentally different in this group (e.g., distribution of muscle mass), tools not specifically validated in athletic populations should be used somewhat cautiously.\n\n#### Sleep Apnea\n\nThe prevalence of sleep apnea may be high in certain type of sports, such as strength, power and high contact sports where athletes often present with a large body mass and neck circumference (Dunican & Eastwood, 2017; Emsellem & Murtagh, 2005; Swinbourne, Gill, Vaile & Smart, 2016). In the National Football League (NFL) and National Hockey League (NHL), two high-speed and contact sports, an elevated body mass index and a large neck circumference are considered protective assets, making athletes less injury-prone (Swinbourne, Gill, Vaile & Smart, 2016). However, these specific body traits, unfortunately, also predispose these athletes to an increased risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (Ahbab & al., 2013; Emsellem & Murtagh, 2005; Mihaere & al., 2009). Two studies carried out among NFL players illustrated that players with these specific physical traits appeared to have a higher incidence of OSA (George, Kab, Kab, Vila & Levy, 2003; Rice & al., 2010). Additionally, in line with the previous Football studies, Dobrosielski and colleagues (2016) illustrated that approximately 8% of the NCAA-I football players were at risk for OSA. Moreover, in professional hockey players, OSA was present in approximately 10% of athletes (Tuomilehto & al., 2017). It is reported that in most cases, the OSA severity was \u201cmild\u201d but even mild OSA might cause major disturbances in sleep (Jackson, Howard & Barnes, 2011), therefore potentially impacting athletic performance.\n\n#### Other Disorders\n\nVery few studies have been conducted on Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) among athletes. Findings from a study assessing a population of runners, indicate prevalence is suggested to be around 13% (Fagundes & al., 2010). Among hockey players, prevalence is suggested to be around 5% (Tuomilehto & al., 2017); Finally, within a sample of rugby players, no participants reported RLS but 12% reported periodic limb movements (PLMs) (Dunican & al., 2019). These three studies have shown that sleep disorders such as RLS and PLMs are relatively common among elite athletes from a variety of sports.\n\n## IMPACT OF SLEEP ON PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE\n\nAdverse effects of sleep restriction on athletic performance have been documented for many years, including cardiorespiratory and psychomotor effects, which require sustained and stable performance over time (Edwards & Waterhouse, 2009; Horne & Pettitt, 1984; Martin, 1981; Mougin & al., 1989; Mougin & al., 1991). Mougin (1991) observed 7 participants on a cycle ergometer, in a study that included a 10 minute warmup, then a 20 minute steady exercise corresponding to 75% of the predetermined maximal oxygen consumption, followed by an increased intensity exercise until exhaustion. This was done along with sleep restriction (3 hours of wakefulness in the middle of the night). In this study, physiological demands were significantly higher during the submaximal effort compared to a baseline night (10:30pm to 7:00am), (Mougin & al., 1991). Heart rate was significantly higher when measured after 9 minutes (167.1 \u00b1 2.0 vs 171.3 \u00b1 2.5) and after 20 minutes (176.0 \u00b1 2.6 vs 179.1 \u00b1 2.4). Also, ventilation (141.0 \u00b1 5.7 vs 157.5 \u00b1 6.4) and respiratory frequency (43.0 \u00b1 1.6 vs 44.7 \u00b1 1.7) were both altered following a sleep restriction when compared to baseline. Similarly, these same variables were significantly higher after the sleep restriction condition when performing a graded exercise stress test, until exhaustion, while the volume of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) decreased. Lactate accumulation was also greater at the 9^th^ minutes (P < 0.01), at the 20^th^ minutes (P < 0.05) of the steady power exercise and at maximal exercise (P < 0.05) following sleep restriction. These results from Mougin (1991) elegantly demonstrated that following a sleep restriction, physical performances would require a higher physiological demand, ultimately leading the athletes to exhaustion faster than he should have been. However, in a separate study there was no significant change in mean or maximal power in anaerobic tests after a 3:00am bedtime, compared to a 10:30pm bedtime (Mougin et al., 1996). Subsequent studies by Mougin showed that following 4-hours sleep restriction, the maximum work rate developed by the participants was reduced by 15 watts for cyclists in a 30-minute exercise at 75% of maximum power (Mougin et al., 2001). In agreement with some of the previous results, the average and maximum power of an anaerobic test decreases among students (Souissi et al., 2008), football players (Abedelmalek et al., 2013) and judokas (Souissi et al., 2013) following a single 4-hour sleep restriction. The reasoning behind the decrease in resistance to exercise is the alteration of the aerobic pathways (Mougin et al., 1989), or in the perceptual change (impression of a longer effort), since the physiological aspects remain predominantly unchanged (Horne & Pettitt 1984, Martin 1981). Indeed, the increase in perceived effort accompanied by a reduction in generated power supports the theory of neuromuscular fatigue (Abbiss & Laursen, 2005), possibly indicating a combination of central nervous system response and neural theory of sleep (Horne & Pettitt 1984, Stickgold, 2005, Walker & Stickgold 2005).\n\nOther studies have also shown adverse impacts of sleep restriction on athletes\u2019 anaerobic power (Taheri & Arabameri, 2012), tennis serving accuracy (Reyner & Horne, 2013), isometric force (Ben, Latiri, Dogui & Ben, 2017), and cortisol levels (Omisade, Buxton & Rusak, 2010). In addition, the average distance traveled by elite runners decreases (6.224 to 6.037 miles) in a treadmill exercise (30 minutes) at their own pace (Oliver, Costa, Laing, Bilzon & Walsh, 2009). Skein and colleagues (2011) reported lower average sprint times, reduced glycogen concentration in the muscles, decreased strength and activation during an isometric force test following a 30-hour total sleep deprivation with 10 athletes from team sports compared to a normal 8-hours of sleep. Submaximal-effort sports, such as running, might be more likely to be affected by total sleep deprivation than the maximum-effort sports, such as weightlifting, as they require more time, therefore negatively impacting the perception of effort throughout time and based on the higher physiological demand required (Mougin & al., 1991). After sleep restriction, the perception of effort increases exponentially increased completion time of the test (Oliver, Costa, Laing, Bilzon & Walsh, 2009). However, the differences in muscle contraction results (voluntary activation) can probably be explained by the sensitivity and accuracy of the electromyography equipment used. For example, previous studies have probably been limited in this aspect contrary to recent studies due to the technological advancement of equipment (Katirji, 2012; Skein, Duffield, Edge, Short & Muendel, 2011). In summary, although the effects of sleep deprivation on exercise are not completely understood, many converging results imply adverse effects of sleep deprivation on athletic performance.\n\nMoreover, the balance of the energy substrate seems vulnerable to sleep deprivation. For instance, a 30-hour sleep deprivation compared to an 8-hour sleep opportunity, demonstrated the inability of the human body to fully recover (24 hours) muscle glycogen in an athletic population as shown by the muscle glycogen concentration before exercise (310 \u00b1 67 mmol*kg^\u22121^ dw vs 209 \u00b1 60 mmol*kg^\u22121^ dw) (Skein, Duffield, Edge, Short & Muendel, 2011). Inadequate glucose intake would hinder athletes' ability to compete for extended periods, as glycogen shortage is known to reduce muscle function and athletic stamina (Costill & al., 1988; Le Meur, Duffield & Skein, 2012). Indeed, it seems that a large energy imbalance leads to a deterioration in both aerobic and anaerobic power production when activity is sustained over several days and sleep is reduced (Guezennec, Satabin, Legrand & Bigard, 1994; Hausswirth & al., 2014; Jung & al., 2011; Markwald & al., 2013; Waterhouse, Atkinson, Edwards & Reilly, 2007). Prolonged periods of sleep deprivation are associated with increased sympathetic nervous system activity and decreases in parasympathetic nervous system activity as well as altered spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity during vigilance testing in healthy adults (Zhong & al., 2005). Since disturbances of sympathetic and parasympathetic equilibrium are associated with overtraining (Achten & Jeukendrup, 2003), it is possible that these disturbances of the autonomic nervous system following sleep deprivation may promote the development of a state of overtraining in athletes (Hynynen, Uusitalo, Konttinen & Rusko, 2006; Le Meur, Duffield & Skein, 2012). Despite this, several studies have reported that sleep deprivation has minimal impact on the cardiorespiratory variables during exercise (Azboy & Kaygisiz, 2009; Horne & Pettitt, 1984; Mougin et al., 1996) as oppose to the previous finding of Mougin and colleagues (1991). Differences are probably more attributable to the protocols administered and the exercise mode used (running, cycling, time of exhaustion) throughout these different studies. In addition to these results, there were no significant effects on cardiorespiratory or thermoregulatory function in athletes despite a reduction in the distance run for 30 minutes on a treadmill following sleep deprivation (Oliver, Costa, Laing, Bilzon & Walsh, 2009). Oliver (2009) hypothesized the minimal effects on cardiorespiratory function could be due to the influence of perceived effort during the final stages of prolonged high intensity exercise (described above).\n\n## IMPACT OF SLEEP ON INJURY RISK AND RECOVERY\n\n### Sleep and concussions\n\nIt is estimated that as many as 3.8 million concussions are sustained in the U.S. during competitive sports (Harmon & al., 2013). Regrettably, approximately 50% of concussions may go unreported (Harmon & al., 2013). As many as 1 million student-athletes reported having two or more concussions during a period of twelve months (Depadilla, Miller, Jones, Peterson & Breiding, 2018). A study indicated that 40% of athletes with a concussion reported that their coaches were not aware of their symptoms (Rivara & al., 2014). Moreover, it is suggested that athletes involved in team sports have significantly higher risk for one or more concussion than athletes in individual sports (Depadilla, Miller, Jones, Peterson & Breiding, 2018).\n\nSleep may play an important role as a risk factor for concussions. Participants were given sleep screening questionnaires and followed over a one-year period. Predictors of incident concussions included clinically moderate to severe insomnia (RR = 3.13, 95% CI: 1.320\u20137.424, p = 0.015) and excessive daytime sleepiness (RR = 2.856, 95% CI: 0.681\u201311.977, p = 0.037), in a study of N=190 NCAA athletes (Raikes, Athey, Alfonso-Miller, Killgore & Grandner, 2019), and these risk factors outperformed more traditional risk factors (e.g., high-risk sport, history of concussions) as predictors.\n\nPost-concussion sleep is also important. Recently, a meta-analysis reported that sleep disturbances were reported following a concussion about 50% of the time (Mathias & Alvaro, 2012). The most common sleep disturbances reported following a concussion are daytime sleepiness and insomnia by 50% and 25%, respectively (Verma, Anand & Verma, 2007). In addition, sleep disturbance may be a prominent contributor to exacerbate comorbid features of depression, fatigue and pain following a concussion (Mathias & Alvaro, 2012) and worsen recovery because normal recuperative functions of sleep are altered (Weber, Webb & Killgore, 2013).\n\nA return to baseline cognition and self-reported symptoms are key priorities that could be adopted to ensure player safety (McCrory & al., 2013; McCrory & al., 2017). However, it has been demonstrated that athletes sleeping fewer than 7 hours the previous night of testing would perform worse (McClure, Zuckerman, Kutscher, Gregory & Solomon, 2014). Considering that the decision of allowing a player back to play results from a comparison of pre and post concussion performance, a valid neurocognitive baseline is needed. In that sense, sleep should be monitored throughout the year to obtain an adequate neurocognitive performance and therefore a valid baseline. Moreover, the difference in symptomatic presentation following a concussion is highly divergent between males and females athletes (Brown, Elsass, Miller, Reed & Reneker, 2015). This highlights the existing gap between the type of athletes and the consideration that should be directed toward an individualize baseline assessment to better detect the symptomology of a concussion.\n\nConcussion, regardless of severity, is an injury to the brain, and athletes who are suspected of such an injury should be carefully monitored (Graham & al., 2014; McCrory & al., 2013a). An increase in awareness has directly led to more interest into post-concussion symptoms (Eisenberg, Meehan & Mannix, 2014; Lau, Collins & Lovell, 2011). Research has specifically pointed out that the continuation of poor sleep symptoms following a concussion was a reliable predictor of prolonged recovery (Gosselin & al., 2009; Lau, Collins & Lovell, 2011a; Sufrinko, Howie, Elbin, Collins & Kontos, 2018). Additionally, Kostyun and colleagues (2015) demonstrated that during recovery, adolescents who reported greater sleep disturbance performed worse on neurocognitive testing.\n\n### Insufficient sleep as a risk factor for injury\n\nAthletes aim to achieve peak performance for as long as possible, given typically short careers with high stakes. An online study of adolescent students (12 to 18 years old) reported that students sleeping less than 8.1 hours a night were 1.7 times more likely to have had an injury than their peers who slept more than 8.1 hours (Jones, Griffiths, Towers, Claxton & Mellalieu, 2018; Milewski & al., 2014). Furthermore, the same study also indicated that for each additional grade in school, students were 1.4 times more likely to have had an injury. Taken together, insufficient sleep duration may increase the risk of injury. Additionally, the summation of years of (accumulated) sleep debt may play a role in risk injury outcomes.\n\nNutrition plays a fundamental role in recovery and injury prevention (Drew & al., 2017; Mountjoy & al., 2018; Pyne, Verhagen & Mountjoy, 2014; Smyth, Newman, Waddington, Weissensteiner & Drew, 2019), and nutrition and sleep have a bidirectional relationship (Chaput & Dutil, 2016; Grandner, Jackson, Gerstner & Knutson, 2013; Grandner, Jackson, Gerstner & Knutson, 2014; Halson, 2014; Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, Oliver, Bastos, Guill\u00e9n & Dom\u00ednguez, 2017). There is an association between the number of hours slept and the intake of dietary nutriments categories (Grandner, Jackson, Gerstner & Knutson, 2014). Furthermore, individuals that have a later bedtime, tend to consume a higher percentage of carbohydrates, fat and protein than the average sleepers (Baron, Reid, Van Horn & Zee, 2013). On the other hand, some nutriment categories may have a positive effect on sleep such as tart cherries and kiwis that are believed to reduce the number of awakening and increasing the sleep time (Lin, Tsai, Fang & Liu, 2011). Although nutritional knowledge is assumed to be high among athletes (Heaney, O\u2019Connor, Michael, Gifford & Naughton, 2011) data are sparse on the number of athletes who are following their diet on a regular basis, and this may be impacted by poor sleep, which influences food intake (Shechter, Grandner & St-Onge, 2014).\n\nAdolescents sleeping fewer than 8 hours per night were more likely to sustain an injury (Von Rosen, Frohm, Friden & Heijne, 2017) compared to students sleeping greater than 8-hours. These results are in line with Milewski and colleagues (2014). This is interesting given that the results are replicated in a population of athletes. Additionally, Von Rosen and colleagues (2017) found that the recommended intake of fruits, vegetables and fish was not met for 20%, 39% and 43% of their athletes, respectively. Therefore, the hypothesis of combined effect of poor sleep and a poor nutrition needs to be further explored in order to better understand the mechanisms underlying injuries in athletes. Moreover, lack of sleep and poor sleep quality exacerbate depression and anxiety symptoms (Owens, 2014), which may also increase injury risk. In a study of N=958 athletes, 40.6% experienced an injury of various nature (Li, Moreland, Peek-Asa & Yang, 2017). At preseason, 28.8% of the 958 enrolled athletes in this study reported anxiety symptoms and 21.7% reported depressive symptoms. Those with anxiety symptoms were 2.3 times more likely to have had an injury (Li, Moreland, Peek-Asa & Yang, 2017). Given the strong association between poor sleep, anxiety and depression symptoms (Baglioni & al., 2011; Lee, Buxton, Andel & Almeida, 2019), it can be speculated that insufficient sleep may indirectly lead to an injury.\n\n### Insufficient sleep and recovery\n\nPoor sleep quality and sleep deprivation impair brain functions that affect a wide array of cognitive functions (Killgore, 2010), which may directly or indirectly facilitate recovery from mental effort and/or physical injury. Furthermore, sleep deprived individuals might increase their intake of unhealthy foods which ultimately will impair glycogen repletion and protein synthesis (Morselli, Leproult, Balbo & Spiegel, 2010), which are critical for recovery in athletes. Additionally, impaired sleep directly affects growth hormone release and alters cortisol secretion (Mougin & al., 2001), therefore, impacting recovery from exercise and stress. Sleep deprivation also increases proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6 and C-reactive Protein (CRP) level which are pain-facilitating agents (McMahon, Cafferty & Marchand, 2005), ultimately affecting the immune system, and hinders muscle recovery and repair from damages sustained in high intensity training and leads towards an imbalance of the autonomic nervous system (Haack, Sanchez & Mullington, 2007; Haack, Lee, Cohen & Mullington, 2009). Moreover, athletes who feel the need to push the boundaries of their capabilities may tend to develop poor sleep patterns, therefore increasing their chances of illness (i.e., medical symptoms) and this impacted their performance and recovery (Hausswirth & al., 2014).\n\n## IMPACT OF SLEEP ON MENTAL AND COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE\n\n### Vigilance and reaction time\n\nSleep restriction has been demonstrated to negatively impact attention and reaction time (Basner & Dinges, 2011; Dinges & al., 1997; W\u0142odarczyk, Ja\u015bkowski & Nowik, 2002). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that reaction times are adversely impacted following only a one night, complete sleep deprivation (Taheri & Arabameri, 2012).\n\nSleep extension, conversely, has been shown to improve reaction times by 15% and also improve objective daytime sleepiness (Kamdar, Kaplan, Kezirian & Dement, 2004) in a study of student-athletes. Mah, Mah, Kezirian & Dement, (2011) extended the sleep of a college basketball team during a 5-7 week period. The average total sleep time increased from 7.50 to 10.25 hours of sleep over this period. Student athletes improved their reaction time scores (p <0.001) in morning and evening testing sessions. Given that athletes often experience at least mild sleep restriction (especially during intense periods of training or competition), sleep management becomes a priority to maximize reaction time. Consistent with the findings on sleep extension, there is evidence that we can \u201cbank\u201d sleep in order to optimize vigilance and reaction time (Arnal & al., 2015; Arnal & al., 2016; Rupp, Wesensten, Bliese & Balkin, 2009).\n\n### Executive function and decision making\n\nExecutive functions are one of the cornerstones to athletic performance (Marchetti & al., 2015; Micai, Kavussanu & Ring, 2015). These include the highest levels of thinking required to engineer a strategy, make a fast decision, demonstrate cognitive flexibility and manage the prioritization of attention. Deep sleep / slow-wave sleep seems to have different restorative functions both at the neurophysiologic and phenomenological level. Indeed, deep sleep appears to have a beneficial impact on the prefrontal cortex which will also have a positive impact on the functions directed by this cerebral region. (Goel, Rao, Durmer & Dinges, 2009; Wilckens, Erickson & Wheeler, 2012). Prioritization or inhibitory control ensures the control of the athlete\u2019s concentration, attention, and thoughts, and suppresses the cognitive and behavioural external and internal distractions (Diamond, 2013; Lehto, Juuj\u00e4rvi, Kooistra & Pulkkinen, 2003). Cognitive flexibility is vital for athletes by ensuring efficiency and adaptation in changing tasks (Diamond, 2013; Kiesel & al., 2010). Adaptation is key in athletics; it prevents athletes from making a bad or a risky decision and this inhibitory control is highly linked to sleep deprivation (Killgore, Balkin & Wesensten, 2006; Rossa, Smith, Allan & Sullivan, 2014).\n\nThese studies underscore the deleterious effects of lack of sleep on executive functions. Too little sleep may alter an athlete\u2019s ability to make a good decision versus a risky one in a split second, during the course of a game or event. Caffeine as been suggested as a countermeasure to protect against effects on risk-taking or poor decision-making (Killgore, Kamimori & Balkin, 2011). However, it has been demonstrated that caffeine does not replace a proper night of sleep for these functions (Clark & Landolt, 2017; Drake, Roehrs, Shambroom & Roth, 2013; Dunican & al., 2018; Reyner & Horne, 2013).\n\n### Learning and memory\n\nLearning new skills is crucial for every athlete. The roots of memory consolidations are found in sleep (Huber, Ghilardi, Massimini & Tononi, 2004; Maquet, 2001; Stickgold, Hobson, Fosse & Fosse, 2001; Stickgold, 2005). The ability to recall information (Gais, Lucas & Born, 2006) is inevitably of interest for athletes. For example, the NFL requires emphasis on the playbook and the ability to recall complex plays is essential for participation in football. Moreover, learning and improving a motor skill is known to continue 24 hours following training (Karni & al., 1998). In healthy young adults, nonrapid eye movement (NREM) stage 2 (N2), typically represent about 45%-55% of total sleep time (Carskadon & Dement, 2011). It has been demonstrated that the duration of sleep stage 2 (NREM) is strongly correlated with the consolidation of motor skills (Albouy, King, Maquet & Doyon, 2013a; Doyon, Gabitov, Vahdat, Lungu & Boutin, 2018; Walker, Brakefield, Morgan, Hobson & Stickgold, 2002). Arguably, the sleep period following learning a new skill is crucial and it has been shown that sleep restriction can adversely impact the memory consolidation (Curcio, Ferrara & De Gennaro, 2006).\n\nWhile it is true to a certain point that \u201cpractice makes perfect,\u201d the results of several studies indicated that sleep after learning improves performance significantly, relative to sleep deprivation (Albouy & al., 2013b; Ashworth, Hill, Karmiloff-Smith & Dimitriou, 2014; Walker & Stickgold, 2006). So perhaps \u201csleep makes perfect.\u201d It should also be noted that sleep restriction also negatively impacts the academic performance of student athletes (Huang & al., 2016). 56 students were either assigned to a 5-hours or 9-hours time in bed (TIB) for 14 consecutive days in which participants had to study for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). Results showed that the sleep-restricted group were significantly impacted for the recall of massed item, which is fundamental in academic success.\n\nAnother group of elite athletes, student-athletes, not only need to be prepared for their competition but also for academics. Turner and colleagues found that general sleep difficulty, initial insomnia, daytime tiredness, daytime sleepiness, and insufficient sleep were all associated with decreased academic performance among student-athletes (Turner & al., 2019). It is partially the coach\u2019s responsibility to mentor their student-athletes to be ready for any kind of test, either athletic or academic. Ultimately, assessing sleep on a regular basis, could provide crucial information for the coaching members and the athletes (Okano, Kaczmaryk, Dave, Gabrieli & Grossman, 2019). Furthermore, having a clear idea of how an athlete sleep may help the team medical specialist prevent injuries such as concussion (Raikes, Athey, Alfonso-Miller, Killgore & Grandner, 2019).\n\n### Creativity and thinking\n\nThrough sleep, the consolidation theory suggests that learning and memory consolidation would benefit creativity (Oudiette & al., 2011). The relationship between sleep and creativity stems from the direct influence of sleep on learning and formation of new concepts, ideas or solutions, and ultimately the genesis of creativity (Marguilho, Jesus, Viseu, Rus & Brandolim, 2014). It was demonstrated that REM sleep can improve creative problem solving (Cai, Mednick, Harrisson, Kanady & Mednick, 2009). REM sleep, according to Cai and colleagues (2009), enhanced creativity for items that are primed before sleep by over 40%. Another study showed that stage 1 sleep was associated with fluency and flexibility and slow wave sleep and REM sleep were associated with originality and global measure of figural creativity (Drago & al., 2011). Furthermore, in a Remote Associates Test (RAT) study, participants were faced with different levels of difficulty and the unsolved problems were re-presented after a period of sufficient sleep, wake or no delay (Sio, Monoghan & Ormerod, 2013). The sleep group solved a greater number of difficult RAT items than the other groups. These findings suggest that sleep facilitates creative thinking for harder problems. Creative problem solving is essential for elite athletes. Every game, every competition, elite athletes are faced with decisions that can either improve or lessen their chance of winning. Therefore, it would be essential to investigate how sleep can enhance problem solving within an environment filled with distractions, coupled with the rapidity of execution which is more typical for elite athletes.\n\n## IMPACT OF SLEEP ON MENTAL HEALTH\n\n### Sleep and anxiety/stress\n\nPrevious studies have pointed out the bidirectional associations between sleep, daily stressors and poor mood states (Lee, Crain, McHale, Almeida & Buxton, 2017; Sin & al., 2017). Moreover, poor sleep quality and short sleep duration were significantly associated with cognitive interferences related to stress the next day such as the experience eof intrusive, unwanted, off-task and potentially ruminated thoughts (Lee, Buxton, Andel & Almeida, 2019). Additionally, associations in the opposite direction were found such as stressful and cognitive interferences throughout the day would lead to an earlier bedtime and earlier wake time (Lee & al, 2019).\n\nPrevalence of anxiety symptoms in adult athletes range from 7.1 to 26% (Gouttebarge, Frings-Dresen & Sluiter, 2015; Gulliver, Griffiths, Mackinnon, Batterham & Stanimirovic, 2015). Student-athletes report higher rates of anxiety, up to 37% (Li, Moreland, Peek-Asa & Yang, 2017; Storch, Storch, Killiany & Roberti, 2005). In a study by Lastella, Lovell and Sargent (2014), 21% of the athletes reported that anxiety was the primary reason for their awakening during the night. Additionally, Savis, Eliot, Gansneder & Rotella, 1997, reported, among student-athletes, a lower sleep quality the night before a competition. Student-athletes reported that the primary reason to their sleep difficulty was anxiety and that this greatly affected their performance the following day (Brassington, 2002; Lee, Buxton, Andel & Almeida, 2019; Walters, 2002). Moreover, Davenne (2009) reported that continuously being in a new sleep environment exacerbated the anxiety, thus negatively impacting sleep and therefore performance.\n\nAthletes not getting sufficient sleep consistently show higher rates of anxiety, therefore leading to an increased difficulty coping with new environmental challenges and stressors, which is a key component to performance for every athlete (Brassington, 2002; Walters, 2002). Further studies are needed to clarify this bidirectional relation in athletes in order to develop appropriate plan of action and adaptative strategy to optimize performance.\n\n## INTERVENTIONS AT THE TEAM LEVEL\n\n### Promoting a culture of healthy sleep\n\nPrioritizing sleep in athletes\u2019 preparation and recovery routine is not an easy task. There is an omnipresent attitude in our society toward sleep that has been put forward where being able to tolerate insufficient sleep is a sign of mental strength and a \u201cbadge of honor\u201d (Adler, 2009; Grandner, 2017). These attitudes may influence young elite athletes who are trying to reach the highest level performance in their respective sports. To counter this, teams can promote a culture of healthy sleep as a performance enhancer. This includes embracing the idea that sleep is essential to athletic performance and recovery and counteract the perception that getting sufficient sleep should produce a feeling of guilt. Several high-profile athletes have now publicly discussed the importance of sleep in their preparation and recovery (Schultz, 2014). Unfortunately, these athletes\u2019 habits are not yet the norm and throughout the literature and sport culture; sleep is not yet a priority among elite athletes and professional team sports, though this may be changing.\n\n### Systematically screening for sleep problems\n\nSystematically screening for sleep problems is required in order to understand the scope of the problem, identify areas that need improvement, and identify individuals at risk for sleep problems (Kroshus & al., 2019). Ideally, teams need to screen athletes at the beginning of the season and follow up with prospective sleep assessment. Challenges include integrating sleep assessments into existing programs, decisions about what tools to use, implementing sleep assessment at multiple timepoints, and strategies for assessing sleep disorders. In addition, developing collaborative relationships with sleep providers should be a priority (Grandner & al., 2016). Healthy sleep for student-athletes: A guide for athletics departments and coaches. NCAA Sport Science Institute Newsletter, 4(2).)\n\nTo date, only one sleep questionnaire has been validated in athletes; the Athlete Sleep Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ) (Bender, Lawson, Werthner & Samuels, 2018). Another promising tool is the Athlete Sleep Behavioral Questionnaire (ASBQ) (Driller, Mah & Halson, 2018), that mainly addresses poor sleep behavior.\n\n### Treating sleep disorders\n\nIn order to treat sleep disorders among elite athletes, proper sleep screening is essential. Different types of athletes may be differentially susceptible to certain types of sleep disorders. For example, American football players may have a higher prevalence of sleep apnea due to their physical attributes (George & Kab, 2011; Rogers & al., 2017), and swimmers may experience circadian rhythm problems due to their early practice schedules (Sargent, Halson & Roach, 2014).\n\nSports medicine teams should be educated on diagnosing and treating sleep disorders and referring to sleep specialists when appropriate (Grandner, 2014), and education about sleep disorders should be provided to both athletes and staff (Kroshus & al., 2019). Furthermore, the sport medicine specialist should also be the provider and the promoter of good sleep behavior and its beneficial effects on athletic and academic performance.\n\nWhen sleep disorders are identified, appropriate evidence-based treatments should be applied, just as in non-athletes (Kroshus & al., 2019; Reardon & al., 2019), including positive airway pressure therapy and oral appliances for sleep apnea and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. It should be noted, though, that sometimes evidence-based treatments of sleep disorders in athletes can be problematic. For example, sedating medications may be clinically indicated but may impede athletics performance, and some empirically supported treatments may actually be banned substances in sport (Reardon & al., 2019). For this reason, clinical providers may need to be sensitive to these issues and may need to consider whether sedating treatments impair performance or whether stimulating treatments are restricted because they are performance-enhancing.\n\n### Managing training and travel schedules\n\nThe relationship between training loads, timing, intensity, sleep and performance is likely quite complex and not entirely understood. An increase in training load and training intensity, and decrease in hours of sleep, is associated with increased injury risk (Von Rosen, Frohm, Kottorp, Frid\u00e9n & Heijne, 2017a). Therefore, training more efficiently may be preferable to training longer or harder. This would be more preferable to the accumulation of training load without a profitable recovery, accompanied with a decrease in performance and the need for an extended period of recovery (Halson & Jeukendrup, 2004; Meeusen & al., 2013).\n\n## CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS\n\nSleep health is an important consideration for athletic performance. Athletes are at high risk of insufficient sleep duration (i.e., less than 7\u20138 hours per night), poor sleep quality (e.g., difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or other sleep difficulties), daytime sleepiness and fatigue, suboptimal sleep schedules (e.g., too early or late), irregular sleep schedules, and sleep & circadian disorders (especially insomnia and sleep apnea). These issues, individually and in combination likely impact athletic performance via a number of domains. Sleep loss and/or poor sleep quality can impair muscular strength, speed, and other aspects of physical performance. Sleep issues can also increase risk of concussions and other injuries, and impair recovery following injury. Cognitive performance is also impacted in a number of domains, including vigilance, learning and memory, decision-making, and creativity. Sleep also plays important roles in mental health, which is important for not only athletic performance, but the well-being of athletes in general. Figure 1 depicts a summary of these findings. These relationships have begun to be formally incorporated into athletics organizations, with official position statements that address sleep health published by the NCAA and the IOC (Kroshus et al., 2019; Reardon et al., 2019).\n\nMuch future research on sleep in athletes is needed. This is because athletes represent a very diverse group of individuals, and most studies in athletes are small, confined to a single team and/or sport, and include inconsistent measurement approaches. In particular, it is still not clear what the best strategy for assessing sleep parameters is in athletes and may likely depend on factors intrinsic to the sport or activity. Additionally, it is not known if standard approaches should be adapted. There is also a lack of trials of sleep interventions thought to positively impact sleep, and still an insufficient number of studies describing how improving sleep can improve performance. Still, there is a large and growing body of evidence that clearly establishes sleep health as an important factor in sport.\n\nImproving sleep in athletes through sleep education at every level of sports organisations has significant implications for health, athletic performance, academic performance and beyond, given the influence each athlete has on the general population as role model. This will not only provide an opportunity to explore a crucial aspect of mental and physical health, but it will also pave the way for new interventions in the area of mental wellbeing. Tracking sleep through questionnaires, wearables and other objective devices is promising but there is still a lot of question marks remaining. It is therefore crucial to develop strategies to mitigate sleep difficulties, not only for physical performance, but also for mental well-being, which will require additional data for a better understanding of the science of sleep.\n\n## KEY POINTS.\n- Insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality are prevalent among athletes, potentially due to time demands, physical demands, and developmental needs.\n- Sleep disturbances among athletes adversely impacts physical performance, mental performance, injury risk and recovery, medical health, and mental health.\n- Sleep interventions among athletes have been shown to improve physical strength and speed, cognitive performance and reaction time, mental health, and other domains.\n- Sport organizations should incorporate sleep health promotion programs at individual, team, and system levels.\n\n## SYNOPSIS.\n\nPrevious research has characterised the sleep of elite athletes and has attempted to identify factors associated with athletic performance, cognition, health and mental well-being. Sleep is considered a fundamental component to performance optimization among elite athletes. Yet, sleep has only recently been embraced by sport organizations as an important part of the training and recovery process. Not only does sleep play a crucial role in physical and cognitive performance, it is also an important factor in reducing the risk of injury. Yet, there are still many gaps in the literature regarding how sleep can be optimized and what the mechanisms are that link sleep and circadian rhythms to performance and recovery. This article aims to highlight the prevalence of poor sleep, describe its impacts, and address the issue of sport culture surrounding healthy sleep.\n\n## DISCLOSURE STATEMENT\n\nDr. Grandner has received grants from Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Nexalin Technology, and Kemin Foods.

Understanding overtraining syndrome (OTS) is helpful in the evaluation, management, and education of athletes.\n\n### Evidence Acquisition:\n\nRelevant articles in English were searched with OVID (1948-2011) and PubMed using the following keywords: *overtraining syndrome*, *overtraining*, *overreaching*, *unexplained underperformance*, *staleness*, *pathophysiology*, *management*, *treatment*, *evaluation*. Bibliographies were reviewed for additional resources.\n\n### Results:\n\nOTS appears to be a maladapted response to excessive exercise without adequate rest, resulting in perturbations of multiple body systems (neurologic, endocrinologic, immunologic) coupled with mood changes. Many hypotheses of OTS pathogenesis are reviewed, and a clinical approach to athletes with possible OTS (including history, testing, and prevention) is presented.\n\n### Conclusions:\n\nOTS remains a clinical diagnosis with arbitrary definitions per the European College of Sports Science\u2019s position statement. History and, in most situations, limited serologies are helpful. However, much remains to be learned given that most past research has been on athletes with overreaching rather than OTS.\n\n**Keywords:** overtraining syndrome, overtraining, overreaching, unexplained underperformance, staleness, pathophysiology, management, treatment, evaluation\n\nGenerally speaking, athletes train to increase performance. Performance increases are achieved through increased training loads. Increased loads are tolerated only through interspersed periods of rest and recovery\u2014training periodization. Overreaching is considered an accumulation of training load that leads to performance decrements requiring days to weeks for recovery.^14,30^ Overreaching followed by appropriate rest can ultimately lead to performance increases.^14,30^ However, if overreaching is extreme and combined with an additional stressor, overtraining syndrome (OTS) may result.^30^ OTS may be caused by systemic inflammation and subsequent effects on the central nervous system, including depressed mood, central fatigue, and resultant neurohormonal changes.^2,45,46^ This article summarizes previous literature and updates the European College of Sport Science\u2019s position statement.^30^\n\n## Terminology\n\nDefinitions from the European College of Sport Science position statement on OTS are used^30^ (Table 1). Symptoms of nonfunctional overreaching (NFO) and OTS are varied, nonspecific, anecdotal, and numerous (Table 2).\n\n### Table 1.\n\nTerminology from position statement on overtraining by European College of Sport Science.^30^\n\n| | | | | | | | | | |\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|Term|Synonym|Definition|Performance Decrement|Outcome| | | | | |\n|Functional overreaching|Short-term overreaching|Increased training leading to a temporary performance decrement and with improved performance after rest|Days to weeks|Positive (super- compensation)| | | | | |\n|Nonfunctional overreaching|Long-term overreaching|Intense training leading to a longer performance decrement but with full recovery after rest; accompanied by increased psychologic and/or neuroendocrinologic symptoms|Weeks to months|Negative due to symptoms and loss of training time| | | | | |\n|Overtraining syndrome| |Consistent with extreme nonfunctional overreaching but with (1) longer performance decrement (> 2 months), (2) more severe symptomatology and maladapted physiology (psychologic, neurologic, endocrinologic, immunologic systems), (3) and an additional stressor not explained by other disease|Months|Negative due to symptoms and possible end to athletic career| | | | | |\n\n### Table 2.\n\nSymptoms of overtraining syndrome.\n\n| | | | | | |\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|Parasympathetic Alterations^*a*^|Sympathetic Alterations^*b*^|Other| | | |\n|Fatigue|Insomnia|Anorexia| | | |\n|Depression|Irritability|Weight loss| | | |\n|Bradycardia|Agitation|Lack of mental concentration| | | |\n|Loss of motivation|Tachycardia|Heavy, sore, stiff muscles| | | |\n| |Hypertension|Anxiety| | | |\n| |Restlessness|Awakening unrefreshed| | | |\n\n^a^\nMore common in aerobic sports.\n\n^b^\nMore common in anaerobic sports.\n\nPast terminology includes burnout, staleness, failure adaptation, underrecovery, training stress syndrome, and chronic fatigue. Some researchers refer to overtraining as unexplained underperformance syndrome.^5,44^ Differentiation of NFO and OTS is clinically difficult and can be made often only after a period of complete rest.^30,36^ The difference between the 2 is based on time to recovery and not necessarily the degree or type of symptoms.^30,36^\n\nMany consider overreaching and overtraining as a continuum.^10^ Others question anecdotal evidence suggesting that NFO precedes OTS.^14^ Unfortunately, much of the literature has been done on overreached rather than overtrained athletes by current terminology. Some studies used *overtrained athletes* but failed to show that these athletes suffered from performance impairment.^14^ Recent reports highlight the importance of psychological and/or social stressors in addition to physiologic stress in the development of NFO/OTS.^20,28,49^ An individual\u2019s stress capacity plays a role in the development of NFO/OTS.^20^\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nEpidemiologic studies use varied terminology. It appears that OTS is extremely rare, but exact prevalence and incidence data are lacking. ^^One study found a NFO lifetime prevalence of ~60% in elite male and female runners, compared with 33% in nonelite female runners.^35^ A multicenter, multicountry survey found that 35% of adolescent swimmers had been \u201covertrained\u201d at least once.^42^ Estimates of \u201cstaleness\u201d were reported in 5% to 30% of swimmers over a season^18,33,37^ and in 15% of British elite athletes.^21^ In the most recent survey of elite adolescent athletes, ~30% reported NFO at least once in their careers\u2014they averaged 2 episodes lasting 4 weeks. The risk was significantly increased in individual sports, low physically demanding sports (such as golf), females, and elite athletes.^27^\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nNumerous hypotheses have been proposed for OTS, each with strengths and weaknesses (Table 3). In attempting to understand OTS mechanistically and clinically, it is crucial to seek an explanation that accounts for the many symptoms of this complicated entity.\n\n### Table 3.\n\nCommon hypotheses of overtraining syndrome etiology (arranged in order of complexity).\n\n| | | | | | | | |\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|Hypothesis|Theory|Strengths|Weaknesses| | | | |\n|Glycogen hypothesis|Decreased glycogen causes fatigue and decreased performance|Low glycogen can be correlated with decreased performance and exercise-induced fatigue|No proven correlation in the literature between low glycogen and overtrained athletesAthletes with normal glycogen levels still become overtrainedDoes not account for all symptoms| | | | |\n|Central fatigue hypothesis|Increased tryptophan uptake in the brain leads to increased 5-HT centrally and mood symptoms|Exercise correlated with increased tryptophan, 5-HT, and fatigueRats undergoing intense training have increased 5-HTSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors decrease performanceAthletes getting branched chain amino acids supplement had less fatigue|Few studies measure 5-HT directlyMood changes/fatigue subjective and difficult to studyMood/fatigue influenced by many other factorsDoes not account for all symptoms| | | | |\n|Glutamine hypothesis|Decreased glutamine causes immune dysfunction and increased susceptibility to infection|Glutamine does decrease after prolonged exerciseIn vitro immune cell function is compromised with decreased glutamineAthletes are more susceptible to upper respiratory tract infections after \u201cintense\u201d exercise|In vivo, decreased plasma glutamine not necessarily correlated with decreased bioavailable glutamineGlutamine supplementation does not improve postexercise impairment of immune cellsSome studies show low glutamine in athletes with upper respiratory tract infections, and some do notGlutamine can be influenced by many other factorsIncreased upper respiratory tract infections are seen in most athletes after intense exercise, not just overtrained onesDoes not account for all symptoms| | | | |\n|Oxidative stress hypothesis|Excessive oxidative stress causes muscle damage and fatigue|Resting markers of oxidative stress are higher in overtrained athletes and increase with exerciseCitrate synthase (marker of oxidative capacity) decreases in overreached rats, so they are more susceptible to oxidative stress|Studies have been smallLack of clinically relevant researchDoes not account for all symptoms| | | | |\n|Autonomic nervous system hypothesis|Parasympathetic predominance causes many symptoms of overtraining syndrome|A study showed variability in autonomic nervous system forces (through heart rate variability) with exercise versus restDecreased heart rate variability with awakening in overtrained athletes suggests disruption of autonomic nervous system modulation|Decreased nocturnal catecholamines in overtrained athletes in some studies;

This can alter synthesis of central neurotransmitters involved in fatigue.^7^ Because decrements in performance and fatigue are hallmarks of OTS, decreased muscle glycogen may cause OTS.\n\nWhile this association seems plausible, it has not been substantiated in the literature. Swimmers who consume inadequate carbohydrates have more fatigue during training but do not necessarily suffer a performance decrement needed to diagnose OTS.^7^ Even athletes who consume increased amounts of carbohydrates and maintain normal glycogen levels can still become overtrained.^47^ While low muscle glycogen levels may be associated with exercise-induced fatigue, the link with OTS appears weak.\n\n### Central Fatigue Hypothesis\n\nOTS nearly always includes disrupted mood, sleep, and behavior.^2,18,22,33,45^ The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) is implicated in regulation of these functions; therefore, alterations in 5-HT could lead to OTS.^2-4,22,30,45^ 5-HT is derived from tryptophan. With exercise, there is increased unbound tryptophan, which competes with branched chain amino acids for entry into the brain.^2-4,45^ Exercise decreases levels of branched chain amino acids due to increased oxidation, favoring tryptophan entry into the brain and conversion to 5-HT.^5^\n\nIncreases in unbound tryptophan have been positively correlated with fatigue, presumably due to increased serotonin synthesis in the brain.^3,4,45^ Giving serotonin reuptake inhibitors to athletes artificially increases 5-HT in the brain and reduces performance.^5^ Conversely, marathon runners receiving branched chain amino acids supplementation felt more energized and mentally clear, possibly due to dampened 5-HT synthesis.^6^\n\nFatigue in overtrained athletes may be due to increased sensitivity to 5-HT rather than increased 5-HT.^4^ Increased neurologic sensitivity to a 5-HT agonist has been reported in overtrained athletes.^4^ Well-trained athletes usually are less sensitive to 5-HT; this adaptation may be lost in OTS.^4^\n\nThere is fairly consistent evidence that concentrations of 5-HT precursors and prolactin, an indirect measure of central 5-HT activity, are altered in excessive exercise,^4^ but few studies have actually measured 5-HT activity in overtrained athletes. Mood changes and fatigue are subjective, difficult to measure, and influenced by many confounding factors.^4^ Therefore, 5-HT activity requires cautious interpretation.\n\n### Glutamine Hypothesis\n\nGlutamine is integral for immune cell function.^14,16,45^ It also plays a role in DNA/RNA synthesis, nitrogen transport, gluconeogenesis and acid-base balance.^14,16,53^ Decreased glutamine after exercise may be responsible for increased incidences of upper respiratory tract infections in overtrained athletes.^14,25,46^\n\nProlonged exercise (> 2 hours) or repeated bouts of high-intensity exercise can transiently decrease plasma glutamine concentrations.^16,53^ Low plasma glutamine concentrations have been reported specifically in overtrained athletes.^14,25^ This may represent overutilization and/or a decreased production by overworked muscles.^16^\n\nIt is unclear whether decreased glutamine influences immune cell function. In vitro, immune cell function can be compromised when glutamine concentrations are below physiologic levels.^16^ Despite decreased glutamine concentrations after exercise, the amount of glutamine available to immune cells does not necessarily change.^16^ Glutamine supplementation can restore physiologic levels but does not improve postexercise impairment of immune cells.^16^ Nevertheless, glutamine supplementation may decrease early rates of infection among athletes.^6^\n\nEpidemiologic data have shown that athletes may be more susceptible to upper respiratory tract infections after \u201cexcessive exercise,\u201d^53^ but there is no evidence that immunosuppression is greater in athletes with NFO/OTS. In one study, 13% of overreached athletes compared with 56% of nonoverreached athletes reported upper respiratory tract infections.^25^ Low plasma glutamine has been seen in athletes with upper respiratory tract infections, while others demonstrate the opposite.^53^ Finally, glutamine levels can be influenced by nutritional state, trauma, and infection.^16^\n\n### Oxidative Stress Hypothesis\n\nSome oxidative stress is desired during exercise because reactive oxygen species released from damaged muscles regulate cellular repair.^50^ When oxidative stress becomes pathologic, however, reactive oxygen species (ie, superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radical) can cause inflammation, muscle fatigue, and soreness with resultant inhibition of athletic performance.^48^\n\nResting markers of oxidative stress are higher in overtrained athletes compared with controls.^17,26,48^ Moreover, oxidative stress markers increase with exercise in the overtrained athletes.^26,48^ Citrate synthase reflects oxidative capacity and is expected to increase during endurance training. In an overreached rat model, citrate synthase activity actually decreases.^17^ OTS athletes may have diminished responses to exercise-induced stress and be more susceptible to oxidative damage.^17^\n\nIt is unclear if the increased oxidative stress state is a trigger or result of OTS. Clinically relevant research is limited. Moreover, confounding factors such as menstrual cycles and estrogen\u2019s antioxidative properties are unknown.^48^\n\n### Autonomic Nervous System Hypothesis\n\nAn imbalance in the autonomic nervous system can explain some symptoms of OTS. Specifically, decreased sympathetic activation and parasympathetic dominance can lead to performance inhibition, fatigue, depression, and bradycardia.^14,22,45^\n\nReduced sympathetic activation in overtrained athletes is supported in some studies by decreased nocturnal urinary catecholamine excretion.^14^ Catecholamine excretion decreases with increasing fatigue and returns to baseline during recovery.^14,20,45^ However, not all studies find this trend.^12,20^ A decreased organ sensitivity to catecholamines may also be responsible for symptoms of decreased sympathetic activation.^22^\n\nHeart rate variability (HRV) has also been used as an indicator of autonomic function.^9,14,51^ One study showed no difference in HRV between overtrained and control athletes during sleep.^19^ However, a reduced HRV was seen soon after awakening in overtrained athletes, suggesting increased sympathetic tone.^19^ Using HRV, studies have indicated that the effects of intense training on automatic control may be reversible. Balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic forces may be restored after a week of rest.^41^\n\n### Hypothalamic Hypothesis\n\nAlterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axes may be responsible for OTS. Endurance athletes may show subtle changes in function of the HPA axis, and overtrained athletes can have alterations in cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone, testosterone, and other hormone levels.^1,14,22,45,51^ Unfortunately, the current data are contradictory as to patterns of these hormonal changes.^14,22,51^ Alterations in the HPA and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axes are individualized and depend on other factors, including exercise capacity, inherent vulnerability to stressors, and other hormonal levels.^14,51^\n\n### Cytokine Hypothesis\n\nNo single hypothesis explains all aspects of OTS. The cytokine hypothesis suggests that OTS is a physiologic adaptation/maladaptation to excess stress initiated by an imbalance between training and recovery.^44-46^\n\nMuscle contraction and repetitive joint action cause microtrauma to tissues.^44,45^ Adaptation through tissue healing and strengthening occurs via activation of a local inflammatory response and recruitment of cytokines.^44,45^ With continued intense training and absence of adequate rest, this inflammatory response can become amplified, chronic, and pathologic.^44-46^ Eventually a systemic inflammatory response can result with negative consequences throughout the body.^44,45^ Implicated cytokines in OTS include interleukin 1 beta (IL-1b), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1)^45^ (Figure 1).\n\nProposed etiology of OTS through exercise and resultant inflammation. There is a time-dependant sensitization with amplification at each step to repeated intermittent stimuli over time.^44,45^\n\nReduced muscle glycogen levels are frequently observed in overtrained athletes.^7,47^ Decreased glycogen may be a consequence of OTS through cytokine-mediated effects.^45^ Cytokines acting on hunger centers in the hypothalamus induce anorexia, resulting in decreased glycogen stores.^45^ Cytokines themselves may interfere with glucose transport into muscle cells for glycogen synthesis. Studies have shown decreased concentrations of GLUT-4 transporters in stressed muscles due to downregulation of protein synthesis by TNF-\u03b1.^45^ Decreased glycogen stores may account for feelings of heavy legs and muscular fatigue in overtrained athletes.^45^\n\nIncreased uptake of tryptophan into the brain and enhanced sensitivity to serotonin have been postulated to induce fatigue and depression.^45^ The cytokine hypothesis argues that serum tryptophan levels are actually decreased with systemic inflammation like that seen in OTS.^45^ The reason is that tryptophan is used for the synthesis of inflammatory-related proteins. Reduced tryptophan levels have actually been associated in many studies with depressive symptoms.^45^\n\nBehavioral and psychological changes seen in OTS can also be attributed to cytokines. Proinflammatory IL-1b and TNF-\u03b1 act on the brain to cause decreased appetite, sleep disturbance, and depression, referred to as \u201csickness\u201d behavior. Cytokines may act directly on central receptors, or they may activate the HPA axis and release of stress hormones with similar peripheral effects.^45^ There is evidence of elevated cytokine levels in depressed patients and a precipitation of depressed mood with cytokine administration to participants, offering credibility to the notion of cytokine-induced mood changes in OTS.^45^\n\nAlterations in the HPA and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axes with a resultant decrease in testosterone:cortisol ratios have been implicated in OTS. Proinflammatory cytokines are potent activators of the HPA system, which cause release of corticotropin-releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and cortisol. These cytokines suppress testosterone through central inhibition.^45^ Although patterns of hormonal changes in OTS are varied, cytokine mediators may be responsible for some of these changes.\n\nPlasma glutamine is decreased in overtrained athletes, and this can be attributed to its increased utilization for various cytokine-controlled processes.^14,16,45^ Glutamine is a precursor for synthesis of inflammatory proteins, which are upregulated with overtraining. IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 actually stimulate glutamine uptake into hepatocytes for this purpose.^45^ In addition, systemic inflammation induces a catabolic state with a necessary increase in glucose and protein metabolism. Glutamine is a crucial element for gluconeogenesis and essential in aiding renal nitrogen excretion with increased proteolysis.^14,16,45^\n\nAs previously mentioned, increased susceptibility to infection in overtrained athletes has been blamed on decreased glutamine without much support.^14,25,46^ There are 2 subsets of T helper cells: TH1 lymphocytes associated with cell-mediated immunity and TH2 lymphocytes linked to humoral immunity.^46^ Which subset predominates depends on the prevailing cytokine milieu. OTS causes activation of cytokines that favor a TH2 lymphocyte profile. Indeed, multiple studies show increases in TH2-favoring cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-10) after a marathon and no detectable levels of TH1-related cytokines.^46^ TH2 predominance causes increased humoral immunity but with a concomitant downregulation of TH1-sponsored cell-mediated immunity and reduced protection against upper respiratory tract infection.^45,46^\n\nThe cytokine theory does provide a comprehensive paradigm to explain many features of OTS. It views systemic inflammation as the underlying basis for overtraining and draws parallels between overtraining and other stress conditions. Unlike many other theories, it proposes to answer \u201cwhy\u201d OTS develops. It presents a primary stimulus that causes activation of many biochemical pathways and correlates activation of these pathways with symptoms observed in overtrained athletes.^45^\n\nAlthough mechanistically sophisticated, the theory does have some concerning limitations. Despite a plausible correlation between cytokines and symptoms of overtraining, there is scant evidence showing elevated cytokine levels in overtrained individuals.^45^ Some studies have demonstrated acute increases in IL-2 and IL-6 following exercise, but long-term responses to training were not explored.^8,9,44^ One study specifically looked at overtrained cyclists but found no changes in IL-6 or TNF-\u03b1 concentrations.^15^ It argued that because muscle contraction during cycling is largely concentric, perhaps there is not a great-enough degree of microtrauma to induce an inflammatory cascade. This seems reasonable, but other studies have found increased IL-6 levels in cyclists.^8^ Athletes in many of the cytokine studies were quite fit at baseline and so it is questionable whether conclusions drawn are similarly applicable to a general population of athletes.\n\nThese are justifiable concerns, but it is uncertain whether they are enough to discredit the mounting body of evidence linking cytokines with OTS. More research is needed before a definitive correlation is demonstrated between elevated cytokine levels and overtrained athletes.\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n### History\n\nPatients will primarily present with unexplained underperformance. Diagnosis of OTS is clinical and accomplished through history,^30^ which should demonstrate the following: (1) decreased performance persisting despite weeks to months of recovery, (2) disturbances in mood, and (3) lack of signs/symptoms or diagnosis of other possible causes of underperformance.^30^ The list of organic diseases that can result in underperformance is extensive and not limited to the following: undiagnosed asthma/bronchial hyperreactivity, thyroid disease, adrenal disease, diabetes mellitus or insipidus, iron deficiency with or without anemia, infection (myocarditis, hepatitis, HIV, etc), and malnutrition (due to eating disorders, celiac sprue, etc).^30^ An extensive nutrition history should be obtained along with an assessment of caloric expenditure.^30^\n\nIf an athlete presents with underperformance without a period of rest and recovery, OTS cannot be diagnosed. By definition, such patient has functional overreaching (FO) versus NFO with possible OTS.^30^ The diagnosis from history can be made only in retrospect given the definitions of NFO and OTS. If less than 14 to 21 days of rest are required for return to previous performance, NFO would be diagnosed. If it has been greater than 14 to 21 days of rest, OTS is diagnosed by some.^30^\n\nOften, underperformance will be met with an increase in training volume and intensity to improve results. History should include assessment of possible triggers^30^ (Table 4). In addition, certain historical clues should raise suspicion of NFO/OTS over organic diseases. These clues include the ability to start a training session but the inability to complete and/or a loss of finishing kick.^3^ While mood symptoms can coexist with organic processes, the presence of pervasive mood changes in the proper setting may signal NFO/OTS versus a primary mood disorder.^2^\n\n#### Table 4.\n\nPotential triggers of overtraining syndrome.^30^\n\n| |\n|--|\n|Increased training load without adequate recovery|\n|Monotony of training|\n|Excessive number of competitions|\n|Sleep disturbances|\n|Stressors including personal life (family, relationships) and occupational|\n|Previous illness|\n|Altitude exposure|\n|Heat injury episode|\n|Severe \u201cbonk\u201d|\n\n### Testing\n\nRuling out organic diseases leading to underperformance is driven by history.^30^ The sports medicine provider may consider screening tests to include comprehensive metabolic panel (including kidney function, potassium, magnesium, and glucose), complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, iron studies, creatine kinase, and thyroid stimulating hormone. Metabolic issues (ie, mitochondrial, glycogen storage, and lipid peroxidation diseases) and cardiovascular disease should be considered in athletes new to higher intensities and volumes.^41^ Cardiovascular disease should be investigated in master athletes or someone with a positive family history.\n\nIn one of the few studies describing evaluation of underperforming athletes, a cause for repeated infections and/or fatigue was found in 68% of regional- or higher-level athletes.^43^ Ninety-three percent of the athletes reported decreases in performance. This evaluation was significant for a more extensive and costly laboratory evaluation, including B12, folate, serology for viral hepatitis, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus/Epstein-Barr virus titers, Epstein-Barr virus DNA in saliva, serum and salivary immunoglobulins (serum immunoglobulin G subclasses and specific serum immunoglobulin E to aeroallergens), and antinuclear antibodies.^43^ Such extensive testing should be considered only in the appropriate setting. In those athletes with atopic complaints (allergic rhinitis, dyspnea and/or exertional cough, eczema), pulmonary function tests should be considered.^41,43^\n\nBiochemical markers have been studied in a variety of athlete populations. There have been no specific or sensitive levels defined for creatine kinase, urea, or iron.^51^ Recently, oxidative stress biomarkers have been found to correlate well with training load and overreached status,^26^ but such markers remain impractical in standard laboratories. Hematologic markers have also been disappointing. Recently plasma viscosity > 1.44 was found to be specific but not sensitive for NFO.^52^\n\nImmunologic markers have also been studied with variable results. Two studies have found increased levels of T cell activation, but such testing lacks practicality.^9,11^ Most recent studies focus on salivary immunoglobulin A. In endurance athletes, lower levels of salivary immunoglobulin A have been correlated with increased incidence of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms.^23^ One study showed 18% to 32% lower levels in athletes with symptoms of overtraining, but no performance measures were reported.^24^ However, another study did not find a statistically significant decrease of salivary immunoglobulin A after intensified training in cyclists.^15^ Most would agree that excessive exercise, FO, NFO, and OTS can result in impairment in cell-mediated immunity, but there does not appear to be an immunologic marker that differentiates them.^30^\n\nHormonal markers have shown some promising results but have a multitude of confounding variables (ie, diurnal and seasonal timing, phase of menstrual cycle, nutritional status).^14,30^ Resting cortisol levels have not differentiated between athletes with and without NFO/OTS. Testosterone results have been contradictory. Some have suggested that a decreased testosterone:cortisol ratio can be diagnostic of NFO and/or OTS. However, the ratio represents the physiologic strain of training rather than the athlete\u2019s maladaption to that stress. The utility of testosterone:cortisol ratio has not been supported by the literature.^14^\n\nCortisol has a peak during the day with nadir during night.^12^ Morning cortisol does not accurately reflect levels of free cortisol.^12^ Free cortisol is filtered by the kidney at a constant rate; therefore, 24-hour and overnight urinary-free cortisol have been more studied.^12^ However, even overnight excretion shows high interindividual variability.^12^ Cortisol (catabolic and anti-inflammatory) is converted to inactive cortisone by 11\u03b2-HSD2. A prospective study found a clinically significant increase in overnight urinary cortisol:cortisone ratio during a high training load period in triathletes, who subsequently underperformed and reported fatigue.^12^ It is proposed that cytokines may inhibit 11\u03b2-HSD2 activity and result in relative increases in cortisol and, hence, catabolism.^12^ However, overnight urinary cortisol:cortisone ratio remains in the research realm and awaits validation.\n\nClinically, it would be helpful to know what level of training signals the change from FO to NFO and from NFO to OTS. However, there are no specific and validated blood markers for NFO or OTS.^51^ Therefore, some have focused on physiologic tests. A couple recent studies show promise for discriminating NFO from OTS. A 2-bout maximal exercise protocol reportedly diagnoses FO, NFO, and OTS by investigating the HPA axis response.^31,32^ The bouts of maximal exercise are separated by 4 hours. It is believed that FO, NFO, and OTS represent a disturbance, an adaptation, and eventual maladaption of the HPA axis. In an early study, FO athletes had a less pronounced hormonal response to a second bout of maximal exercise in comparison with the extremely exaggerated response in NFO athletes.^32^ These findings were in contrast to the extreme response to the first bout of exercise and absence of response to the second bout in OTS athletes.^31^ This first study displayed great utility in picking up FO before NFO.^32^ In the most recent study of 2-bout maximal exercise protocol, reliable differentiation of NFO from OTS was achieved. However, the diagnosis of NFO and OTS was made retrospectively and arbitrarily defined OTS as greater than 1 year of symptoms. Athletes were tested after having symptoms ranging from 2 weeks to 1 year and prospectively followed for resolution of symptoms. After a second bout, NFO athletes showed very large increases in adrenocorticotropic hormone and prolactin, whereas OTS athletes showed absent or very limited increases. The study\u2019s authors propose that the different responses are due to hypersensitivity of glucocorticoid receptors in NFO compared with insensitivity in OTS. This would seem to confirm a disturbance in the HPA and give credence to the close relationship between OTS and other stress-related syndromes, such as major depression and posttraumatic stress disorder.^31^ If findings can be replicated, 2-bout maximal exercise protocol may have prognostic value by identifying athletes requiring greater than 1 year to recover.\n\nPhysiologic testing with resting heart rate, maximal heart rate, and HRV do not show consistent results, nor do they allow differentiation of FO, NFO, and OTS. Researchers have argued that use of performance tests for diagnosis is \u201cpolluted\u201d by the underperformance inherent to NFO and OTS.^29^ However, the most consistent finding is a diminished maximal lactate in OTS, but it was not sensitive enough to rule out NFO.^30^ In an analysis of the literature, greater performance decreases were found in studies that report time to fatigue versus studies that report more functional performance measures (ie, 100- or 400-m swim, 15-minute time trial).^14^\n\nMost agree that psychological distress is required for diagnosis of OTS. The best-studied measure is Profile of Mood States scores. In 2 studies, 81% of \u201cstale\u201d swimmers were identified with the Profile of Mood States questionnaire.^34,37^ However, increased scores can be seen in athletes with increased training without FO/NFO^34^ and have not always been reported with performance measures.^37^ Regardless, mood questionnaires can be prospectively followed, are cheap, and are quickly available. Variables such as timing of testing in relation to training must be standardized. In a case study of an NFO athlete, it was suggested that decreased Profile of Mood States vigor score may be more specific to overreaching than the Profile of Mood States fatigue score. It is suggested that fatigue is a \u201cnormal experience\u201d in athletes, whereas decreased vigor can be viewed as maladaptive.^13^\n\n## Treatment\n\nTreatment varies based on the etiology for the underperformance,^30^ and any organic disease should be treated appropriately. No treatment is required for FO other than balancing overload training with appropriate recovery.^30^ Treatment of NFO and OTS is rest; however, some propose that relative rest is more appropriate.^3^ It is recommended to build up volume prior to intensity, starting from 5 to 10 minutes daily until 1 hour is tolerated.^3^ It is unclear which strategy is best, so the motivation for exercise, internal versus external, should be considered when recommending complete versus relative rest. Given the significant psychological overlay, one may consider involving a sports psychologist or other mental health expert in multidisciplinary management.^30^ If stress, depression, and/or anxiety are increased with full rest, relative rest with well-defined expectations should be provided.^30^\n\nTreatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor is suggested by some based on similarities between neuroendocrinologic changes between depression and OTS.^2,38^ However, one should be cautious of increased heat stress and possible decreased performance with antidepressant treatment in athletes. In addition, if sleep complaints are prominent, treatment with trazodone or amitriptyline could be considered.^38^\n\n## Prevention\n\nGiven the unethical nature of inducing OTS in athletes and uncertain pathogenesis, there are no evidence-based means of preventing OTS. However, observation of training load, performance measures, and mood questionnaires can help interrupt the progression from FO to NFO/OTS.^30,33,34^ A study has shown a decrease in \u201cburnout\u201d in collegiate swimmers from 10% to zero when altering training load in response to the Profile of Mood States questionnaire. When the mood state decreased, training load was also decreased.^33,34^\n\nMajor components of prevention are screening and education. One should educate athletes at risk for overtraining that one of the initial signs of overreaching is increased rating of perceived exertion for a given workload.^34^ In addition, sports medicine providers may consider preemptively asking if training has increased to compensate for decreases in performance. History of athletes should include inquiry about training (monotony, excessive load, sudden increase, caloric/hydration needs in relation to load) and personal stressors (interpersonal, family, sleep, travel)^30^ (Tables 4 and 5).\n\n### Table 5.\n\nPreventative measures for nonfunctional overreaching/overtraining syndrome.^2,44^\n\n| |\n|--|\n|Periodization of training|\n|Tapering for competition|\n|Adjust training volume and intensity based on performance and mood|\n|Ensure adequate calories for training load|\n|Ensure adequate hydration|\n|Ensure adequate carbohydrate ingestion during exercise|\n|Ensure adequate sleep|\n|Promoting mental toughness or resilience as buffer|\n|Rest period of greater than 6 hours between exercise bouts|\n|Abstinence of training following infection, heat stroke/stress, periods of high stress|\n|Avoid extreme environmental conditions|\n|Utilize Profile of Mood States (or stress level) and alter training load|\n\n## Future Directions\n\nSome hope that a recently developed animal model of overtraining may help guide further hypothesis testing of NFO and OTS.^17^ A very promising technology being studied in elite athletes is Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. A group of researchers are monitoring athletes prospectively, and they propose that changes in metabolism can be appreciated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy before symptoms and objective performance decrements are clinically appreciated.^39,40^ Their results are very thought-provoking but require independent validation.\n\nOthers are suggesting further investigation of psychomotor speed testing as a means of diagnosing OTS.^36^ In a survey of the literature, psychomotor speed is known to be decreased in many different pathologies, most notably major depression and chronic fatigue syndrome, which share many characteristics with NFO/OTS.^36^ One study showed differences in psychomotor speed between NFO/OTS athletes and control athletes. However, a decrease in psychomotor speed was also found in overload training without FO and in a second group that did show FO.^36^\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOTS remains a clinical diagnosis with arbitrary definitions per the European College of Sports Science\u2019s position statement.^30^ History and, in most situations, limited serologies are paramount. Many pathophysiologic hypotheses have been proposed. Currently, it appears that OTS represents a systemic inflammatory process with diffuse effects on the neurohormonal axis affecting host immunology and mood.^30^ OTS is a maladapted response to exercise when excessive and not matched with appropriate rest.^30^\n\n## Footnotes\n\n^*^\nReferences 18, 21, 27-33, 35, 37, 42.\n\n## References\n- 1.\n  Angeli A, Minetto M, Dovio A, et al.\n  The overtraining syndrome in athletes: a stress-related disorder.

          "snippet": "## Quick Answer\n\nThis calculator estimates your VO2max (maximal oxygen uptake) from the Cooper 12-minute run test using Dr. Kenneth Cooper's validated formula. Results help athletes assess cardiovascular fitness and track training progress.\n\n**Calculates**VO2max instantly from your 12-minute run distance **Based on**Cooper's 1968 formula with 0.90 correlation to lab testing **Provides**fitness classification, percentile ranking, and training recommendations\n\n\u2026\n\nThe test measures your body's ability to utilize oxygen during sustained physical activity\u2014a key indicator of cardiovascular health and endurance performance. Whether you're a marathon runner tracking training progress, a soccer player preparing for the season, or a military recruit preparing for physical assessments, the Cooper test provides valuable insights into your aerobic fitness level.\n\n### Test Purpose\n\nTo test aerobic fitness (the ability of the body to use oxygen to power it while running). The Cooper test specifically measures your VO2max potential\u2014the maximum rate at which your body can consume oxygen during intense exercise.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Test Procedure\n\n- Place markers at set intervals around the track to aid in measuring the completed distance\n\n- Complete a thorough warm-up (5-10 minutes of light jogging and dynamic stretches)\n\n- On the start signal, begin running at a sustainable pace\n\n- Continue running for exactly 12 minutes\u2014walking is allowed but should be minimized\n\n- Record the total distance covered when the 12-minute timer ends\n\n\u2026\n\n### Calculation Example\n\nLet's walk through an example for a 25-year-old male athlete who covers 2.6 km in 12 minutes:\n\n**Step 1:**Apply the formula: VO2max = (22.351 \u00d7 2.6) - 11.288 **Step 2:**Calculate: VO2max = 58.11 - 11.288 = 46.82 ml/kg/min **Result:**This places the athlete in the \"Good\" fitness category for his age group\n\n\u2026\n\n## Sport-Specific Applications\n\nDifferent sports have varying aerobic fitness requirements. Here's how the Cooper test relates to various athletic pursuits:\n\n### Endurance Sports (Marathon, Triathlon, Cycling)\n\n**Target:**VO2max > 55 ml/kg/min for competitive athletes **Elite standard:**>3.0 km in 12 minutes\n\n- Marathon runners typically score in the excellent range as aerobic capacity directly impacts performance\n\n### Team Sports (Soccer, Basketball, Rugby)\n\n**Target:**VO2max 45-55 ml/kg/min **Competition standard:**2.4-2.8 km in 12 minutes\n\n- Field players require high aerobic bases for sustained game performance and recovery between sprints\n\n### Military and Law Enforcement\n\n**Minimum standard:**Typically 2.4 km (1.5 miles) in 12 minutes\n\n- The Cooper test is widely used for fitness assessments in armed forces worldwide\n\n- Regular testing helps maintain operational readiness\n\n### Professional Athlete Benchmarks\n\n**Elite endurance athletes:**VO2max 70-85+ ml/kg/min (equivalent to >3.6 km in Cooper test) **Professional soccer players:**Typically 55-65 ml/kg/min **World record context:**Kenenisa Bekele's 5000m world record (12:37.35) suggests he could cover approximately 4,752m in 12 minutes\n\n\u2026\n\n### For Advanced Athletes (Good to Excellent)\n\n- Incorporate high-intensity interval training (HIIT): 6-10 \u00d7 400m at 90-95% effort\n\n- Add VO2max intervals: 3-5 \u00d7 3-5 minutes at race pace\n\n- Periodize training with base, build, and peak phases\n\n- Consider altitude training or heat acclimatization for elite performance",

So why even bother?\n\nBecause when done right, VO2 max intervals help you:\n\n**Handle fatigue better in the back half of the race** **Push hard under pressure** **Tolerate lactate buildup and keep moving** **Reduce perceived effort at race pace** **Build muscular output and speed under fatigue**",

Your 5K PR won't directly predict your HYROX time. The strength stations level the playing field between runners and strength athletes.\n\n### Common Athlete Profiles\n\n**The Runner**\n\n- 5K: 18-20 min\n\n- Strength training: Minimal\n\n- Expected HYROX: 1:30-1:40 (men), 1:50-2:00 (women)\n\n**Bottleneck:**Sled push (152kg/102kg), sled pull, wall balls\n\n**The CrossFitter**\n\n- 5K: 22-24 min\n\n- CrossFit: 3+ years\n\n- Expected HYROX: 1:25-1:35 (men), 1:40-1:50 (women)\n\n**Bottleneck:**Running endurance, pacing the 8km\n\n**The Balanced Athlete**\n\n- 5K: 20-22 min\n\n- Strength training: 2-3x/week\n\n- Expected HYROX: 1:20-1:30 (men), 1:35-1:45 (women)\n\n**Advantage:**No major weaknesses\n\nPure runners often overestimate their HYROX performance by 10-15 minutes, while CrossFitters underestimate theirs by 5-10 minutes. Train both equally for best results.\n\n## What Makes an Elite HYROX Time?\n\nBreaking into elite territory (\n\n**sub-1:15 men**, **sub-1:24 women**) requires four key elements:\n\n### Sub-5:00/km Running Pace\n\nElite athletes average\n\n**4:30-4:50/km** across all 8km of running, even when fatigued from stations.\n\n### Station Efficiency\n\n|Station|Elite Time (Men)|Elite Time (Women)|\n|--|--|--|\n|SkiErg (1000m)|3:50-4:20|4:30-5:00|\n|Sled Push (152kg/102kg)|2:50-3:26|2:50-3:25|\n|Sled Pull (103kg/78kg)|3:50-4:37|4:15-4:59|\n|Burpee Broad Jumps|4:00-4:37|5:15-5:57|\n|Row (1000m)|4:00-4:33|4:45-5:11|\n|Farmers Carry (48kg/32kg)|1:45-1:59|2:00-2:15|\n|Lunges (20kg/10kg)|3:50-4:24|4:00-4:30|\n|Wall Balls (100 reps)|5:30-6:04|5:20-5:53|\nOne bad station can cost you 5-10 minutes. Elite athletes have NO stations slower than 80th percentile\u2014they're well-rounded, not specialists.\n\n### Minimal RoxZone Time\n\nElite athletes average 4-5 minutes total RoxZone time. Intermediate athletes average 7-8.5 minutes, while beginners may take 9-12 minutes or more.\n\n**RoxZone includes:**\n\n- Running from finish line to station\n\n- Running from station to next start line\n\n- Brief mental prep and equipment setup\n\n### Mental Toughness\n\nThe ability to maintain pace when everything hurts. Elite athletes don't slow down\u2014they manage discomfort better.\n\n## How to Improve Your HYROX Time\n\nBased on your current level:\n\n### Beginners (1:40-2:10)\n\n**Focus:** Finish strong, build base fitness\n\n**Training priorities:**\n\n- Run 3-4x per week at conversational pace\n\n- Practice all 8 stations 1x per week\n\n- Focus on technique before speed\n\nDon't worry about speed yet. Learn proper form on all stations\u2014especially sled push/pull technique with the heavy weights (152kg/103kg for men, 102kg/78kg for women).\u2705\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf Ready to train smarter?** Our 12-Week HYROX Training Program takes you from beginner to race-ready with structured workouts, station technique guides, and proven pacing strategies. Just **$29.99** \u2014 less than a single PT session. Start training smart today.\n\n### Intermediate (1:25-1:40 / 1:37-1:54)\n\n**Focus:** Identify weak stations, improve pacing\n\n**Training priorities:**\n\n- Track your split times\u2014find your slowest 2 stations using our race analyzer tool\n\n- Add 1-2 specific station workouts per week\n\n- Practice negative splitting (running faster as race progresses)\n\n- Use our pacing calculator to set realistic split targets\n\n**Example weakness work:**\n\n- Slow at sled push? Add 2x/week heavy sled work\n\n- Slow at wall balls? Practice 100-rep sets 2x/week\n\n### Advanced (1:15-1:25 / 1:24-1:37)\n\n**Focus:** Fine-tune pacing, maximize efficiency\n\n**Training priorities:**\n\n- Interval training 2x per week (tempo runs, VO2 max)\n\n- Station-specific drills 2-3x per week at race weight\n\n- Practice race-pace RoxZone transitions (sprint between stations)\n\n- Mental toughness training (running under fatigue)\n\n- Analyze your performance data with our race analyzer tool\n\n**Want to break through to the next level?** Our structured 12-week program includes progressive periodization, race simulation protocols, and advanced pacing strategies designed to take intermediate athletes to sub-1:20 performance.\n\n### Elite (under 1:15 / 1:24)\n\n**Focus:** Marginal gains, competition strategy\n\n**Training priorities:**\n\n- Periodized training blocks (build, peak, taper)\n\n- Race simulation workouts every 2-3 weeks\n\n- Video analysis of technique on all stations\n\n- Strategic pacing per course (elevation, heat, competition)\n\n## Realistic Time Improvement Expectations\ud83d\udca1\n\nMost athletes improve 15-25% from their first to second race simply by understanding pacing, knowing the stations, and better race-day nutrition.\n\n**First year:** 15-25% improvement\n\n**Year 2-3:** 5-10% annual improvement with consistent training\n\n**Plateau:** Most athletes plateau after 3-5 years unless they significantly change training\n\n### Example Progression (Male, 30-34):\n\n**First race:**1:55:00 (beginner) **6 months later:**1:40:00 (intermediate) \u2192 13% improvement **1 year later:**1:25:00 (advanced) \u2192 15% improvement **2 years later:**1:15:00 (elite) \u2192 12% improvement **3+ years:**1:10-1:14 (peak elite performance)\n\n## Station Benchmarks: Where Are You Losing Time?\n\nHere's what \"good\" looks like for each station (Men / Women, Intermediate level):\n\n|Station|Intermediate (M/W)|Advanced (M/W)|\n|--|--|--|\n|SkiErg|4:27 / 5:11|4:20 / 5:00|\n|Sled Push|3:41 / 3:42|3:26 / 3:25|\n|Sled Pull|5:06 / 5:34|4:37 / 4:59|\n|Burpee Broad Jumps|5:19 / 6:50|4:37 / 5:57|\n|Row|4:44 / 5:24|4:33 / 5:11|\n|Farmers Carry|2:10 / 2:25|1:59 / 2:15|\n|Lunges|4:56 / 5:01|4:24 / 4:30|\n|Wall Balls|7:01 / 6:51|6:04 / 5:53|\nIf any of your stations are slower than the \"Intermediate\" column, that's your biggest opportunity for improvement. Focus 50% of your training on your weakest 2 stations.\n\n## Your Next Steps\n\nNow that you know where you stand:\n\n**Log your last race splits**\u2014 Find your weak stations **Set a realistic goal**\u2014 Aim for 1 category improvement (Beginner \u2192 Intermediate) **Train specifically**\u2014 Dedicate 2x per week to your weakest station **Track progress**\u2014 Retest stations every 4-6 weeks\n\n#### Key Takeaway\n\nA \"good\" HYROX time is relative to your age, gender, and training background. Focus on improving YOUR time, not comparing yourself to elites. Every PR is worth celebrating.\n\n## FAQs\n\n**Q: What's the average HYROX finish time?**\n\nA: Men average around 1:40:00, women average around 1:54:00 across all age groups and divisions. The median (50th percentile) is slightly faster at 1:33-1:38 for men and 1:47-1:52 for women.\n\n**Q: Is sub 1:30 good for a first race?**\n\nA: Absolutely! Sub 1:30 for men puts you in the advanced category (top 30%). For women, sub 1:45 is also advanced level.\n\n**Q: How long does it take to go from beginner to elite?**\n\nA: Most athletes need 3-5 years of consistent, structured training. Expect 10-20% annual improvement in your first 2 years.\n\n**Q: Do pros use different weights?**\n\nA: No. Pro and Open athletes use the same weights (152kg sled push for men, 102kg for women). Only age group 60+ uses modified weights.\n\n**Q: Why are the sleds so heavy?**\n\nA: HYROX uses 152kg (men) and 102kg (women) for sled push to test strength-endurance. The heavy sleds separate pure runners from hybrid athletes.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions About HYROX Times\n\n### What is a good HYROX time for beginners?\n\nFor beginners, a good HYROX time is 1:40-1:54 for men and 1:54-2:10 for women. If you finish your first race in this range, you're performing better than about 50% of HYROX athletes. Focus on completing the race and building a baseline\u2014you can improve your times with targeted training.\n\n### What is the average HYROX time?\n\nThe average HYROX time for men is approximately 1:35, while women average around 1:50. However, this varies significantly by age group, with younger athletes (25-35) typically finishing 5-10 minutes faster than those in the 45-55 age bracket.\n\n### What HYROX time is considered elite?\n\nElite HYROX times are under 1:15 for men and under 1:26 for women. These times put you in the top 10% of all HYROX finishers globally and typically require years of focused training in both running and functional fitness.\n\n### How do HYROX times vary by age?\n\nHYROX times typically slow by 2-3 minutes per decade after age 35. A 1:30 time for a 25-year-old male would be equivalent to approximately 1:37 for a 45-year-old athlete with similar training. Our age group analysis shows detailed breakdowns by age bracket.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYour best time is one you're proud of. Whether you're chasing a PR, trying to beat a friend, or just finishing your first race\u2014every HYROX time represents hours of hard work.\n\nUse these benchmarks to set realistic goals and train smarter, not to judge your worth as an athlete.\n\n**Related Articles:**\n\n- Age Group Performance Analysis \u2014 Detailed age breakdown\n\n- Average Split Times by Age Group \u2014 Realistic benchmarks\n\n- First HYROX Race Guide \u2014 Complete beginner guide\n\n- How to Beat 1:30 \u2014 Complete training requirements\n\n",

Recovery & Adaptation Science for Hybrid Athletes\n\n---\n\n### 1.1 Sleep\n\n#### Optimal Sleep Duration\n\nAthletes training 10\u201312 hours per week require **8.0\u20139.5 hours of sleep per night** for optimal recovery and adaptation. This is supported by multiple lines of evidence:\n\n- **Stanford sleep extension studies** (Mah et al., 2011): When collegiate basketball players extended sleep to ~10 hours, sprint times improved, shooting accuracy increased by 9%, and reaction times off the blocks were faster. Similar results were replicated in swimmers and tennis players (Mah et al., 2011; Sleep Foundation, 2025).\n- **IOC position statement** (Reardon et al., 2019): Recommends a minimum of 7 hours for adult athletes, but acknowledges this is a *floor*, not a target.\n- **Epidemiological data**: Elite athletes average only 6.5\u20136.8 hours of sleep (Leeder et al., 2012; Lastella et al., 2015), which is *insufficient*. Athletes sleeping <7 hours had 1.7\u00d7 higher injury risk (Milewski et al., 2014).\n\n**AI Coach Rule**: Target 8\u20139 hours of actual sleep time (not time in bed). If an athlete consistently logs <7 hours, flag this as a primary recovery limiter before adjusting training load.\n\n#### Sleep Quality Metrics That Matter\n\n| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |\n|--------|--------|----------------|\n| Deep sleep (SWS) | \u22651.5 hours (15\u201320% of total) | Growth hormone release is synchronized with slow-wave sleep (Shapiro et al., 1981). Critical for tissue repair, glycogen repletion, and anabolic processes (GSSI, SSE-113). |\n| REM sleep | \u22651.5 hours (20\u201325% of total) | Motor skill consolidation, learning, creativity, and emotional regulation (Walker & Stickgold, 2006; Cai et al., 2009). |\n| Sleep efficiency | \u226585% | Time asleep / time in bed. Athletes average only 80.6% vs. 88.7% in non-athletes (Leeder et al., 2012). |\n| HRV during sleep | Stable or trending upward | Nocturnal HRV reflects parasympathetic recovery. A sustained drop of >1 SD below baseline for 3+ nights signals incomplete recovery (Hynynen et al., 2006). |\n| Wake after sleep onset | <30 minutes | Excessive WASO fragments deep sleep and REM cycles. |\n\n#### Impact of Poor Sleep on Training Adaptations\n\nThe research is unequivocal \u2014 poor sleep degrades virtually every adaptation pathway relevant to Hyrox:\n\n1. **Aerobic performance**: Sleep restriction (4 hours) reduced time to exhaustion and increased lactate accumulation at submaximal intensities. VO\u2082max decreased, and heart rate was significantly elevated at the same workload (Mougin et al., 1991, 2001). One night of sleep deprivation decreased treadmill distance covered by 3% (Oliver et al., 2009).\n2. **Glycogen repletion**: 30-hour sleep deprivation reduced pre-exercise muscle glycogen by 33% (310 vs. 209 mmol/kg; Skein et al., 2011), directly impairing endurance capacity.\n3. **Hormonal disruption**: Sleep deprivation impairs growth hormone secretion, increases cortisol, and disrupts testosterone production (Mougin et al., 2001; Spiegel et al., 1999). This shifts the body toward a catabolic state.\n4. **Immune function**: Prolonged insufficient sleep increases pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, CRP), suppresses cell-mediated immunity, and increases upper respiratory tract infection risk (Haack et al., 2007, 2009; Charest & Grandner, 2020).\n5. **Motor learning**: Sleep after learning a new skill is critical for motor consolidation (Walker et al., 2002). Poor sleep impairs technique acquisition \u2014 relevant for SkiErg efficiency, wall ball rhythm, and sled mechanics.\n6. **Perceived exertion**: The most consistent finding is that sleep-deprived athletes report *everything* feeling harder, even at the same absolute intensity (Oliver et al., 2009).\n\n#### Practical Sleep Hygiene Recommendations\n\n1. **Consistent wake time** (\u00b130 min, even on weekends) \u2014 anchors circadian rhythm\n2. **Cool bedroom** (18\u201320\u00b0C / 64\u201368\u00b0F) \u2014 facilitates core temperature drop for sleep onset\n3. **Dim lights 60\u201390 min before bed** \u2014 supports melatonin production\n4. **No caffeine after 1:00 PM** (or \u22658 hours before bed) \u2014 caffeine taken even 6 hours before bed reduced total sleep by 41 minutes (Drake et al., 2013)\n5. **No screens 30\u201360 min before bed** \u2014 or use blue light filters\n6. **Post-training cool-down**: After evening training, allow \u22652 hours before bed. A warm shower 90 min pre-bed paradoxically helps by triggering peripheral vasodilation and subsequent core cooling.\n7. **Strategic napping**: 20\u201330 min naps before 2:00 PM can partially offset sleep debt without disrupting nighttime sleep.\n8. **Sleep banking**: 1\u20132 weeks of extended sleep (10+ hours) before a high-load training block or race can buffer against subsequent restriction (Arnal et al., 2015, 2016).\n\n---\n\n### 1.2 Active Recovery Protocols\n\n#### What to Do on Rest Days\n\nRest days are not passive \u2014 they are *active recovery* days. The goal is to enhance blood flow, clear metabolic waste, promote tissue remodeling, and maintain nervous system readiness without adding training stress.\n\n**Ideal Rest Day Structure (90\u2013120 min total across the day):**\n- 30\u201345 min low-intensity movement (walking, easy cycling, swimming)\n- 15 min mobility routine (see Section 1.3)\n- 10\u201315 min foam rolling / self-myofascial release\n- Optional: 10\u201315 min sauna or contrast exposure\n- Prioritize sleep, nutrition, and hydration\n\n#### Low-Intensity Movement\n\nThe purpose of active recovery movement is to stay below the ventilatory threshold \u2014 conversational pace, RPE 2\u20133/10, heart rate <60% HRmax (Zone 1).\n\n| Modality | Duration | Intensity | Notes |\n|----------|----------|-----------|-------|\n| Walking | 30\u201360 min | RPE 2/10 | Best general recovery; minimal eccentric load |\n| Easy cycling | 20\u201340 min | RPE 2\u20133/10, <120 bpm | Non-weight-bearing; good for leg recovery |\n| Swimming (easy) | 20\u201330 min | RPE 2\u20133/10 | Hydrostatic pressure aids lymphatic drainage; excellent for whole-body recovery |\n| Yoga / gentle flow | 30\u201345 min | RPE 2/10 | Combines mobility, breathing, parasympathetic activation |\n\n**Key principle**: If an athlete finishes active recovery feeling more fatigued than when they started, the intensity was too high.\n\n#### Foam Rolling / Self-Myofascial Release\n\n**What the evidence supports:**\n- **Acute ROM improvement**: Foam rolling increases range of motion by 4\u201310% without decreasing force production or neuromuscular activation (MacDonald et al., 2013; Halperin et al., 2014; Cheatham et al., 2015 meta-analysis).\n- **Recovery from DOMS**: Foam rolling post-exercise reduced perceived soreness at 24, 48, and 72 hours, and improved dynamic performance measures (sprint speed, broad jump, vertical jump) compared to controls (Pearcey et al., 2015; MacDonald et al., 2014).\n- **Mechanism**: Likely a combination of neurological (pain-gate modulation, altered mechanoreceptor signaling) and vascular effects (increased nitric oxide, improved endothelial function) rather than mechanical tissue deformation (Wiewelhove et al., 2019 meta-analysis).\n\n**What is myth:**\n- Foam rolling does NOT \"break up\" scar tissue or fascial adhesions. The forces required to deform fascia (~450 N) far exceed what a foam roller produces.\n- Foam rolling does NOT permanently increase flexibility \u2014 effects are transient (10\u201320 min) unless paired with consistent training through new ROM.\n\n**Practical prescription:**\n- **Dose**: 60\u2013120 seconds per muscle group, moderate pressure (pain should be \u22646/10)\n- **Frequency**: Daily on rest days, post-training on training days\n- **Priority areas for Hyrox**: Quadriceps, hip flexors, calves, thoracic spine, lats, forearm extensors\n\n#### Stretching: Static vs. Dynamic\n\n| Type | When to Use | Evidence |\n|------|-------------|----------|\n| **Dynamic stretching** | Pre-workout, during warm-up | Improves acute performance (power, sprint speed, agility). Recommended as part of all warm-ups (Behm & Chaouachi, 2011). |\n| **Static stretching** | Post-workout, rest days, evenings | Improves chronic flexibility over weeks when held \u226530 sec (Bandy & Irion, 1994). Pre-exercise static holds >60 sec can reduce force production by 5\u20137% (Kay & Blazevich, 2012 meta-analysis). Shorter holds (<30 sec) likely have negligible performance effects. |\n| **PNF stretching** | Dedicated mobility sessions | Most effective for ROM gains but requires a partner or band. Contract-relax: 6 sec contraction, 30 sec stretch, 3 rounds. |\n\n**AI Coach Rule**: Never prescribe >30 sec static holds before strength or power-dominant sessions (sled work, wall balls). Dynamic stretching only in pre-workout warm-ups.\n\n#### Cold Water Immersion / Ice Baths\n\nThe evidence on CWI is **mode-dependent and nuanced**:\n\n**Post-resistance training \u2014 AVOID:**\n- Roberts et al. (2015) demonstrated that CWI (10\u00b0C for 10 min) after resistance training attenuated acute anabolic signaling (phosphorylation of p70S6K, satellite cell activity) and, over 12 weeks, resulted in significantly less muscle hypertrophy and strength gains compared to active recovery.\n- Malta et al. (2021) meta-analysis confirmed: CWI consistently diminishes resistance training adaptations including strength, power, and rate of force development (Petersen & Fyfe, 2021).\n\n**Post-endurance training \u2014 NEUTRAL:**\n- CWI does NOT appear to negatively affect aerobic adaptations (cycling time trial performance, VO\u2082max, mitochondrial biogenesis) in trained athletes (Halson et al., 2014; Broatch et al., 2017; Malta et al., 2021).\n- The high-intensity exercise stimulus may create a ceiling effect for mitochondrial adaptation, leaving little room for CWI to either help or harm (Granata et al., 2016).\n\n**Practical recommendation for Hyrox athletes:**\n- **Avoid CWI on days with strength-focused work** (heavy sled, squat days, hypertrophy sessions).\n- **Permissible after pure running sessions** if subjective recovery is needed, particularly during competition periods or multi-day events.\n- **During race week/taper**: CWI can be used for perceived recovery benefit without concern for long-term adaptation.\n- **Protocol if used**: 10\u201315\u00b0C water, 10\u201312 minutes immersion.\n\n#### Sauna / Heat Exposure\n\n**Current evidence supports sauna use as an ergogenic aid:**\n\n- **Plasma volume expansion**: Scoon et al. (2006) found that 12\u201315 post-exercise sauna sessions (~87\u00b0C, 30 min) over 3 weeks increased plasma volume by 7.1% and improved 5K time trial performance by 1.9%.\n- **Comprehensive adaptation study**: Kirby et al. (2021) showed 3 weeks of post-exercise sauna bathing improved VO\u2082max, running speed at 4 mmol/L lactate, and time to exhaustion \u2014 to a greater extent than endurance training alone.\n- **Heat acclimation benefits**: Reduced heart rate during exercise, reduced core temperature, increased sweat rate, improved thermoregulation \u2014 all beneficial for Hyrox performance (especially in indoor venues which are often warm).\n\n**Practical prescription:**\n- **Frequency**: 3\u20134 sessions per week, post-training\n- **Protocol**: 80\u2013100\u00b0C dry sauna, 15\u201330 min per session (start at 15 min, build to 30)\n- **Timing**: Immediately after easy/moderate training sessions (not before strength work)\n- **Hydration**: Consume 500\u2013750 mL water with electrolytes during/after sauna\n- **Caution**: Extending beyond 3 weeks showed only marginal additional benefit (Kirby et al., 2021). 3-week blocks are sufficient.\n\n**Unlike CWI, sauna does NOT appear to attenuate strength or hypertrophy adaptations**, making it the preferred thermal recovery modality for hybrid athletes.\n\n---\n\n### 1.3 Mobility Routines for Hyrox Athletes\n\n#### Key Mobility Restrictions Affecting Hyrox Performance\n\n| Restriction | Stations Affected | Consequence |\n|------------|-------------------|-------------|\n| **Thoracic extension** | SkiErg, Wall Balls, Rowing | Inability to fully extend arms overhead limits SkiErg pull length and wall ball catch position. Compensatory lumbar extension increases injury risk. |\n| **Hip flexor mobility** | Lunges, Running, Sled Push, Burpee Broad Jumps | Tight hip flexors reduce stride length, cause anterior pelvic tilt during lunges, and limit hip extension drive in sled push. |\n| **Ankle dorsiflexion** | Wall Balls, Lunges, Sled Push | <35\u00b0 of dorsiflexion forces compensatory heel rise, forward torso lean, and reduced squat depth. Limits lunge step length. |\n| **Shoulder mobility** (flexion + internal rotation) | SkiErg, Wall Balls, Rowing | Restricted overhead range reduces SkiErg stroke length. Poor internal rotation limits rowing catch position. |\n| **Grip and forearm** | Farmers Carry, Sled Pull, Rowing | Forearm extensor tightness and poor wrist extension limit grip endurance. Crucial for 200m farmer's carry and sled pull rope work. |\n\n#### 15-Minute Daily Mobility Routine\n\nPerform daily \u2014 on rest days as standalone, on training days post-workout or in the evening.\n\n| # | Movement | Target Area | Duration/Reps | Cues |\n|---|----------|-------------|---------------|------|\n| 1 | **Foam roll thoracic spine** | T-spine extension | 60 sec | Roller at mid-back, arms crossed over chest, extend over roller through 5\u20136 segments. Pause 10 sec at each stiff segment. |\n| 2 | **Open book rotations** | T-spine rotation | 8 reps/side | Side-lying, knees stacked at 90\u00b0, top arm rotates open to floor. Follow hand with eyes. Exhale into end range. |\n| 3 | **Half-kneeling hip flexor stretch** | Hip flexors (psoas, rec fem) | 45 sec/side | Rear knee on pad, squeeze glute on rear leg, slight posterior pelvic tilt, shift hips forward. Add same-side arm overhead reach for psoas bias. |\n| 4 | **90/90 hip switches** | Hip internal/external rotation | 10 reps (5/side) | Sit on floor, both legs at 90\u00b0, rotate hips to switch lead leg. Keep chest tall. Controlled 3 sec transitions. |\n| 5 | **Wall ankle dorsiflexion mobilization** | Ankle dorsiflexion | 10 reps/side (2 sec holds) | Front foot 10\u201312 cm from wall, drive knee over toes to touch wall. Keep heel down. Progress by moving foot further from wall. |\n| 6 | **Supine shoulder flexion (PVC/dowel)** | Shoulder overhead ROM | 10 reps | Lie on back, knees bent, hold PVC wide grip, slowly arc overhead to floor. Keep ribs pinned down (no rib flare). 3 sec tempo each direction. |\n| 7 | **Thread the needle** | T-spine rotation + shoulder | 6 reps/side | Quadruped position. Reach one arm under body, rotate to thread through. Then open arm to ceiling. Follow hand with eyes. |\n| 8 | **Forearm extensor stretch + wrist circles** | Grip/forearm | 30 sec stretch + 10 circles/direction | Extend arm, palm down, gently pull fingers back with opposite hand. Then perform slow wrist circles. |\n| 9 | **Deep squat hold (goblet position)** | Ankles, hips, T-spine (integrated) | 60 sec total (break into 2\u00d730 sec if needed) | Hold light weight at chest, sit into deep squat, elbows inside knees pressing out. Breathe diaphragmatically. Shift weight side to side. |\n| 10 | **Couch stretch** | Rectus femoris + hip flexors | 45 sec/side | Rear foot on wall/couch, front foot in lunge. Squeeze glute, stay upright. This is the most effective hip flexor stretch for athletes who sit. |\n\n**Total time**: ~15 minutes. Perform in order listed.\n\n#### 5-Minute Pre-Workout Activation Routine\n\nPerform before every training session after a 5-min general warm-up (easy jog/bike).\n\n| # | Movement | Purpose | Sets \u00d7 Reps |\n|---|----------|---------|-------------|\n| 1 | **Cat-cow** | T-spine mobilization, breathing | 1 \u00d7 8 (slow, coordinated with breath) |\n| 2 | **World's greatest stretch** | Hip flexors, T-spine rotation, hamstrings, ankles | 1 \u00d7 4/side |\n| 3 | **Lateral band walks** | Glute med activation (running, lunges, sled) | 1 \u00d7 10/direction |\n| 4 | **Banded pull-aparts** | Posterior shoulder activation (SkiErg, row, wall ball catch) | 1 \u00d7 15 |\n| 5 | **Bodyweight squats to calf raise** | Ankle ROM + glute/quad activation + calf prime | 1 \u00d7 10 |\n\n**Total time**: ~5 minutes. Non-negotiable before every session.\n\n---\n\n### 1.4 Overtraining & Overreaching\n\n#### Definitions (European College of Sport Science Position Statement; Meeusen et al., 2006)\n\n| Term | Performance Decrement | Recovery Time | Outcome |\n|------|----------------------|---------------|---------|\n| **Functional Overreaching (FO)** | Days to ~2 weeks | Short-term | *Positive* \u2014 supercompensation after rest |\n| **Non-Functional Overreaching (NFO)** | Weeks to months | Extended | *Negative* \u2014 lost training time, psychological/neuroendocrine symptoms |\n| **Overtraining Syndrome (OTS)** | Months to >1 year | Prolonged | *Severely negative* \u2014 potential career-ending; maladapted HPA axis, systemic inflammation |\n\nKey insight: These exist on a continuum, and the differentiation between NFO and OTS can only be made *retrospectively* based on recovery time (Kreher & Schwartz, 2012). Lifetime NFO prevalence in elite runners is ~60% (Morgan et al., 1987). OTS is rare but devastating.\n\n#### Early Warning Signs for AI Coach Monitoring\n\n| Marker | Normal Variation | Concerning Threshold | Action Trigger |\n|--------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------|\n| **Performance decline** | \u00b12\u20133% day-to-day | >5% decline sustained over 2+ weeks despite adequate recovery | Flag for review |\n| **Resting heart rate** | \u00b13 bpm day-to-day | \u22655 bpm above rolling 7-day average for 3+ consecutive days (Kreher & Schwartz, 2012; TrainingPeaks) | Reduce intensity; monitor for illness |\n| **HRV depression** | \u00b15\u201310% day-to-day | >1 standard deviation below 7-day rolling mean for 3\u20134 consecutive days (Human Performance Alliance, 2024) | Insert recovery day; reduce volume 30% |\n| **Sleep disruption** | Occasional poor night | <6 hrs for 3+ consecutive nights, OR sleep efficiency <75% for 1+ week | Mandatory light day; investigate cause |\n| **Mood/motivation changes** | Normal fluctuation | Profile of Mood States (POMS) vigor score decline >15% or persistent negative mood for 5+ days | Conversation prompt; reduce training load |\n| **Persistent soreness** | 24\u201348 hr DOMS normal | Muscle soreness \u22654/10 persisting >72 hours after a familiar workout | Skip strength session; active recovery only |\n| **Training session completion** | Can start AND finish | Ability to start but inability to complete planned sessions (classic OTS sign; Budgett, 1998) | Immediate red flag; insert 3+ rest days |\n\n#### Decision Framework: Push Through vs. Back Off\n\n**PUSH THROUGH fatigue when:**\n- HRV is within normal range (within 1 SD of rolling mean)\n- Resting HR is within 3 bpm of baseline\n- Athlete reports 6/10 or better motivation/mood\n- Soreness is \u22643/10 and localized (not systemic)\n- Sleep was \u22657 hours with normal quality\n- Performance in warm-up sets is within 5% of expected\n\n**BACK OFF when any 2+ of these are true:**\n- HRV depressed >1 SD below baseline for 2+ days\n- Resting HR elevated \u22655 bpm for 2+ days\n- Mood/motivation \u22644/10\n- Soreness is systemic (whole body) and >72 hours post-training\n- Sleep was <6 hours or severely disrupted\n- Performance in warm-up sets is >5% below expected\n\n**MANDATORY REST when any 1 of these is true:**\n- Signs of illness (sore throat, fever, swollen glands)\n- Resting HR elevated \u22658 bpm above baseline\n- Unable to complete warm-up at expected intensity\n- 3+ warning signs present simultaneously for 3+ consecutive days\n\n#### Reactive Deload Protocol\n\nUnlike planned deloads (every 3\u20134 weeks), reactive deloads are triggered by the warning signs above. The AI coach should implement the following:\n\n**Phase 1 \u2014 Acute Response (Days 1\u20133):**\n- Reduce training volume by 50%\n- Eliminate all high-intensity work (no intervals, no heavy lifting)\n- Replace planned sessions with Zone 1 movement only (30\u201340 min walk, easy bike)\n- Prioritize 9+ hours of sleep opportunity\n- Increase carbohydrate intake by 1 g/kg/day\n\n**Phase 2 \u2014 Assessment (Days 4\u20135):**\n- Retest: Check morning HRV, RHR, sleep quality, subjective mood\n- If markers improving \u2192 transition to Phase 3\n- If markers unchanged or worsening \u2192 extend Phase 1 for 3 more days and screen for illness/life stressors\n\n**Phase 3 \u2014 Gradual Return (Days 6\u201310):**\n- Day 6\u20137: 70% of normal volume, low-to-moderate intensity only\n- Day 8\u201310: 85% of normal volume, reintroduce moderate intensity\n- Day 11+: Return to full programming if all markers are normalized\n\n**Critical rule**: The athlete must demonstrate 2 consecutive days of normalized HRV and RHR before returning to high-intensity training.\n\n---\n\n### 1.5 Nutrition for Training\n\n#### Daily Caloric Needs\n\nA hybrid athlete running ~35\u201340 miles per week (56\u201364 km) plus 4\u20135 strength sessions requires substantial caloric intake. Using established estimates:\n\n- **Running**: ~80\u2013100 kcal/mile \u00d7 35\u201340 mpw = 2,800\u20134,000 kcal/week from running\n- **Strength**: ~250\u2013400 kcal/session \u00d7 4\u20135 = 1,000\u20132,000 kcal/week from lifting\n- **BMR + NEAT**: ~1,800\u20132,200 kcal/day for a 70\u201385 kg male athlete\n\n**Estimated total**: **2,800\u20133,800 kcal/day** for a male Hyrox athlete (70\u201385 kg). Female athletes (55\u201370 kg): **2,200\u20133,000 kcal/day**. These ranges depend on body size, training phase, and metabolic rate. Chronic underfueling leads to Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S) (Mountjoy et al., 2018 IOC Consensus).\n\n#### Macronutrient Targets\n\n| Macronutrient | Target | Evidence Base |\n|---------------|--------|---------------|\n| **Protein** | **1.6\u20132.2 g/kg/day** | ISSN position stand (J\u00e4ger et al., 2017): 1.4\u20132.0 g/kg/day for exercising individuals. Concurrent training athletes (combined endurance + resistance) should target the *upper end* of this range (1.6\u20132.2 g/kg) due to increased amino acid oxidation from endurance work (PMC, 2025: 0.4\u20130.5 g/kg per meal for endurance-adapted athletes). Distribute across **4\u20135 meals** at 0.3\u20130.5 g/kg per meal (20\u201340 g per serving). |\n| **Carbohydrates** | **5\u20138 g/kg/day** (training days); **3\u20135 g/kg/day** (rest days) | ACSM/AND/DC joint position (2016): 5\u20137 g/kg for 1 hr/day moderate exercise, 6\u201310 g/kg for 1\u20133 hr/day moderate-to-high. A Hyrox athlete training 1.5\u20132.5 hr/day should target 5\u20138 g/kg on training days. Lower on rest days to support recovery without excess. |\n| **Fat** | **Minimum 0.8 g/kg/day**; optimal **1.0\u20131.5 g/kg/day** (20\u201335% of total calories) | Fat is essential for hormone synthesis (testosterone, estrogen), fat-soluble vitamin absorption (D, E, K, A), and cell membrane integrity. Below 0.8 g/kg, hormonal dysfunction risk increases. No performance benefit from going above 35% of calories. |\n\n#### Pre-Workout Nutrition\n\n| Scenario | Timing | Composition |\n|----------|--------|-------------|\n| **AM session (fasted risk)** | 60\u201390 min before: full meal OR 30\u201345 min before: light snack | Full meal: 1\u20132 g/kg carbs + 0.3 g/kg protein + low fat. Snack: banana + small protein shake, rice cake + honey + nut butter. |\n| **PM session (fed state)** | 2\u20133 hours before: regular meal OR 60 min before: snack | If last meal was 3+ hours ago, have a snack with 30\u201350g carbs and 15\u201320g protein. If meal was within 2 hours, no additional food needed. |\n| **Two-a-day sessions** | Between sessions: prioritize carb repletion | 1.0\u20131.2 g/kg carbs within 30 min of first session ending (Beelen et al., 2010). Add 20\u201325g protein. |\n\n#### Post-Workout Nutrition: Evidence vs. Myth\n\n**The \"30-minute anabolic window\" is largely a myth** \u2014 at least for athletes training in a fed state (Aragon & Schoenfeld, 2013; Schoenfeld et al., 2013):\n\n- **Fed state training**: If the athlete consumed a meal within 3\u20134 hours before exercise, amino acids and insulin are still elevated. The \"window\" effectively extends to 5\u20136 hours surrounding training. Total daily protein intake matters far more than precise post-workout timing (Schoenfeld et al., 2013).\n- **Fasted state training**: If training occurs after an overnight fast (early AM), post-workout protein becomes more time-sensitive. Consume 20\u201340g protein within 1\u20132 hours.\n- **For glycogen repletion**: If the athlete has another session within 8 hours, carbohydrate timing IS important \u2014 consume 1.0\u20131.2 g/kg carbs as soon as practical post-exercise (Beelen et al., 2010). If the next session is 24+ hours away, timing is less critical; total daily intake matters more.\n\n**Practical recommendation**: Consume a mixed meal of protein (30\u201340g) and carbohydrates (0.8\u20131.2 g/kg) within 2 hours of training. Don't stress if it's 30 minutes vs. 90 minutes \u2014 the difference is negligible for most fed-state athletes.\n\n#### Hydration\n\n- **Daily fluid target**: Minimum 35\u201345 mL/kg bodyweight (~2.5\u20133.5 L for a 75 kg athlete) PLUS replacement of exercise-induced losses.\n- **Sweat rate estimation**: Weigh before and after 1 hour of training (minimally clothed, toweled dry). Each kg lost \u2248 1L of sweat. Typical range: 0.5\u20132.5 L/hour.\n- **Electrolyte needs**: Sodium is the primary electrolyte lost in sweat (300\u20131,200 mg/L). Athletes training >90 min or heavy sweaters should add 500\u20131,000 mg sodium per hour of training (sports drink, electrolyte tabs, or salted food).\n- **Urine color**: Pale straw = adequate. Dark gold = dehydrated. Clear = likely overhydrated (flushing electrolytes).\n\n#### Supplements With Actual Evidence\n\n| Supplement | Evidence Level | Dose | Mechanism | Hyrox Relevance |\n|-----------|---------------|------|-----------|-----------------|\n| **Creatine monohydrate** | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 (A-level) | 3\u20135 g/day (no loading needed) | Replenishes phosphocreatine for short-burst power; may improve glycogen repletion; supports lean mass. ISSN position stand confirms safety and efficacy (Buford et al., 2007). | High: Sled push, sled pull, farmers carry, wall balls \u2014 all benefit from repeated high-force contractions. |\n| **Caffeine** | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 (A-level) | 3\u20136 mg/kg, 30\u201360 min pre-exercise | Adenosine receptor antagonist; reduces perceived exertion, improves endurance and strength-endurance. | High: Race day and key training sessions. Monitor sleep impact \u2014 stop use by early afternoon. |\n| **Beta-alanine** | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 (A-level) | 3.2\u20136.4 g/day (split doses to avoid paresthesia) | Increases intramuscular carnosine, buffering H\u207a ions during high-intensity work (60\u2013240 sec efforts). Hoffman et al. (2006): Co-supplementation with creatine improved repeated sprint performance. | Moderate-High: Wall balls (5\u20137 min sustained), SkiErg (3\u20134 min), Rowing (4\u20135 min) \u2014 all in the sweet spot of beta-alanine's buffering capacity. |\n| **Vitamin D** | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 (if deficient) | 1,000\u20134,000 IU/day (test serum 25(OH)D; target >40 ng/mL) | Supports bone health, immune function, muscle function, mood. Deficiency is common (40\u201375% of athletes; Larson-Meyer & Willis, 2010). | Moderate: Foundational health. Deficiency impairs recovery and increases injury risk. |\n| **Omega-3 (EPA/DHA)** | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 (B-level) | 2\u20133 g combined EPA+DHA daily | Anti-inflammatory; may reduce DOMS severity and improve muscle recovery (Jouris et al., 2011). Supports cardiovascular health. | Moderate: Recovery support for high training volumes. |\n| **Electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium)** | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 (practical) | As needed based on sweat losses | Maintain fluid balance, nerve/muscle function | High: Essential for training >60 min, especially in warm indoor Hyrox venues. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Testing & Benchmarking Protocols\n\n---\n\n### 2.1 Baseline Testing Battery (Week 0)\n\nAdminister over 3\u20134 days to allow adequate recovery between tests. Testing order matters \u2014 do not combine maximal aerobic and maximal strength tests on the same day.\n\n#### Day 1: Body Composition + Aerobic Capacity\n\n**Body Composition (5 min)**\n- Body weight (fasted, morning, after voiding)\n- Waist circumference (at navel, relaxed exhale)\n- Estimated body fat: Use Navy method (neck + waist circumference for men; neck + waist + hip for women) or skinfold calipers (3-site). Track trends, not absolute values.\n\n**Cooper 12-Minute Run Test (30 min including warm-up)**\n- **Warm-up**: 10 min easy jog + dynamic stretches + 2 \u00d7 30-sec strides\n- **Protocol**: Run as far as possible in exactly 12 minutes on a flat track (400m preferred) or flat treadmill\n- **Scoring**: Record total distance in meters\n- **VO\u2082max estimation**: VO\u2082max = (22.351 \u00d7 distance in km) \u2212 11.288 (Cooper, 1968; correlation r = 0.90 with lab VO\u2082max testing)\n- **Cool-down**: 5 min easy walk\n\n| Distance (m) | Estimated VO\u2082max (mL/kg/min) | Hyrox Relevance |\n|--------------|------------------------------|-----------------|\n| 2,000 | 33.4 | Beginner \u2014 significant aerobic work needed |\n| 2,400 | 42.4 | Intermediate \u2014 solid aerobic base |\n| 2,800 | 51.3 | Advanced \u2014 strong aerobic capacity |\n| 3,000+ | 55.8+ | Elite \u2014 competitive aerobic fitness |\n\n#### Day 2: Lactate Threshold Proxy + Running Economy\n\n**30-Minute Time Trial (45 min total)**\n- **Warm-up**: 10 min easy jog + 4 \u00d7 30-sec progressive strides\n- **Protocol**: Run at the fastest pace sustainable for exactly 30 minutes (flat course or treadmill at 1% incline). This approximates functional threshold pace (Inglis et al., 2020).\n- **Record**: Total distance AND average pace. Average heart rate during final 20 minutes = estimated lactate threshold heart rate (LTHR).\n- **Cool-down**: 5 min easy jog\n\n**Running Economy Assessment (integrated)**\n- During warm-up, note pace at conversational effort (can speak in full sentences = Zone 2 / aerobic base pace).\n- Record this pace \u2014 it serves as the reference for all easy running prescriptions.\n\n#### Day 3: Strength Baselines\n\n**Estimated 1RM Testing (60 min total)**\n\nUse a 3RM or 5RM test and calculate estimated 1RM. Safer and more practical than true 1RM testing for non-competitive lifters.\n\n| Lift | Protocol | 1RM Estimation |\n|------|----------|----------------|\n| **Back Squat** | Warm-up: empty bar \u00d7 10, 50% \u00d7 5, 70% \u00d7 3, 85% \u00d7 1. Then: find heaviest set of 3 (3RM). | 1RM \u2248 3RM \u00d7 1.08 (Brzycki formula) |\n| **Deadlift** | Same warm-up progression. Find 3RM. | 1RM \u2248 3RM \u00d7 1.08 |\n| **Strict Press** | Warm-up: empty bar \u00d7 10, 50% \u00d7 5, 70% \u00d7 3. Find 5RM. | 1RM \u2248 5RM \u00d7 1.15 |\n\n- Rest 3\u20135 min between max-effort attempts\n- Record load AND bodyweight for strength-to-bodyweight ratio calculation\n\n#### Day 4: Station-Specific Time Trials\n\nPerform each station individually with full recovery. **Rest 5\u20138 minutes between stations** to capture true station capacity, not fatigue carryover.\n\n| Station | Protocol | Record |\n|---------|----------|--------|\n| **SkiErg 1,000m** | All-out effort for 1,000m | Time (mm:ss) + avg pace/500m |\n| **Sled Push 50m** | Race weight (152 kg men / 102 kg women); complete 50m as fast as possible | Time (mm:ss) |\n| **Sled Pull 50m** | Race weight (103 kg men / 78 kg women); seated rope pull | Time (mm:ss) |\n| **Burpee Broad Jumps 80m** | Full 80m as fast as possible | Time (mm:ss) |\n| **Row 1,000m** | All-out effort for 1,000m | Time (mm:ss) + avg pace/500m |\n| **Farmers Carry 200m** | Race weight (2 \u00d7 24 kg men / 2 \u00d7 16 kg women); complete 200m | Time (mm:ss) + number of drops |\n| **Sandbag Lunges 100m** | Race weight (20 kg men / 10 kg women); complete 100m | Time (mm:ss) |\n| **Wall Balls 100 reps** | Race weight (6 kg men / 4 kg women to 3m/2.7m target); 100 unbroken or with breaks | Time (mm:ss) + break pattern |\n\n**Note**: Station testing in isolation is faster than race performance because there is no accumulated fatigue. Race-day station times are typically 15\u201330% slower than fresh testing.\n\n---\n\n### 2.2 Monthly Check-In Tests\n\nNot every test needs to be repeated monthly. Frequency depends on sensitivity to change and athlete fatigue cost.\n\n| Test | Frequency | Rationale |\n|------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Cooper test** (or 2K time trial) | Every 4\u20136 weeks | VO\u2082max changes slowly; monthly testing captures meaningful trends |\n| **30-min time trial** | Every 6\u20138 weeks | Threshold fitness changes slowly; over-testing adds unnecessary fatigue |\n| **Body composition** (weight, waist) | Every 2\u20134 weeks | Weight weekly (rolling 7-day average); waist monthly |\n| **Strength 3RM tests** | Every 6\u20138 weeks | Strength gains in trained athletes are slow; frequent maximal testing adds injury risk |\n| **Station time trials (2 stations)** | Every 4 weeks \u2014 rotate which 2 stations | Test the 2 weakest stations each month; cycle through all 8 over 4 months |\n| **Resting HR / HRV** | Daily (passive monitoring) | Trend data; not a formal \"test\" but the most valuable ongoing metric |\n| **Running economy (Zone 2 pace at same HR)** | Every 4 weeks | Track cardiac drift: same HR should produce faster pace as fitness improves |\n\n#### Interpreting Month-over-Month Changes\n\n| Metric | Meaningful Improvement | Noise / Normal Variation |\n|--------|----------------------|--------------------------|\n| Cooper test distance | \u2265100m improvement | \u00b150m (weather, motivation, fatigue) |\n| 30-min TT distance | \u2265200m or \u22655 sec/km pace improvement | \u00b1100m |\n| Back squat 3RM | \u22655% increase | \u00b12.5% (daily readiness variation) |\n| SkiErg 1,000m | \u22655 sec improvement | \u00b13 sec |\n| Wall Balls 100 reps | \u226515 sec improvement | \u00b18 sec |\n| Sled push 50m | \u226510 sec improvement | \u00b15 sec (sled surface friction varies) |\n| Zone 2 pace at same HR | \u22655 sec/km faster | \u00b13 sec/km (temperature, hydration) |\n\n**Principle**: Require \u22652 consecutive tests showing improvement in the same direction before concluding a real training effect. Single data points are unreliable.\n\n---\n\n### 2.3 Performance Predictors & Targets\n\n#### VO\u2082max Targets by Hyrox Performance Tier\n\n| Hyrox Finish (Men) | Estimated VO\u2082max Required | Cooper Test Distance | 5K Proxy |\n|--------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|----------|\n| Sub-60 min (Pro elite) | \u226560 mL/kg/min | \u22653,200m | <17:00 |\n| 60\u201375 min (Elite/Advanced) | 50\u201360 mL/kg/min | 2,750\u20133,200m | 17:00\u201320:00 |\n| 75\u201390 min (Intermediate) | 42\u201350 mL/kg/min | 2,400\u20132,750m | 20:00\u201324:00 |\n| 90+ min (Beginner) | <42 mL/kg/min | <2,400m | >24:00 |\n\n*Women: Adjust VO\u2082max thresholds down ~5 mL/kg/min, running paces ~10\u201315% slower.*\n\n#### Strength-to-Bodyweight Ratios Correlated with Hyrox Performance\n\n| Lift | Beginner (<90 min) | Intermediate (75\u201390) | Advanced (60\u201375) | Elite (<60) |\n|------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------|\n| Back Squat 1RM/BW | 0.8\u20131.0\u00d7 | 1.0\u20131.3\u00d7 | 1.3\u20131.6\u00d7 | 1.6\u20132.0\u00d7 |\n| Deadlift 1RM/BW | 1.0\u20131.3\u00d7 | 1.3\u20131.6\u00d7 | 1.6\u20132.0\u00d7 | 2.0\u20132.5\u00d7 |\n| Strict Press 1RM/BW | 0.4\u20130.5\u00d7 | 0.5\u20130.65\u00d7 | 0.65\u20130.8\u00d7 | 0.8\u20131.0\u00d7 |\n\n**Rationale**: Sled push (152 kg) requires substantial lower body strength. An 80 kg male pushing 152 kg is pushing ~1.9\u00d7 BW. A higher squat-to-BW ratio directly predicts sled push speed. Similarly, deadlift strength correlates with sled pull performance, and press strength supports wall ball and SkiErg overhead drive.\n\n#### Running Pace Benchmarks Predicting Hyrox Performance\n\n| 5K Time | 10K Time | Predicted Hyrox Running Split (8 km) | Hyrox Tier |\n|---------|----------|--------------------------------------|------------|\n| <17:00 | <35:00 | 32\u201336 min | Elite |\n| 17:00\u201320:00 | 35:00\u201342:00 | 36\u201344 min | Advanced |\n| 20:00\u201324:00 | 42:00\u201350:00 | 44\u201354 min | Intermediate |\n| >24:00 | >50:00 | >54 min | Beginner |\n\n**Note**: Hyrox running splits include RoxZone transitions and the metabolic cost of station-to-run transitions. Expect Hyrox km pace to be 20\u201340 sec/km slower than standalone 10K pace.\n\n#### Station-Specific Benchmarks Indicating Race Readiness\n\nBased on data from Hyrox Data Lab (700,000+ race results) and ChAIron training guides:\n\n| Station | Beginner Target | Intermediate Target | Advanced Target | Elite Target |\n|---------|----------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| SkiErg 1000m | 5:00\u20136:00 | 4:00\u20135:00 | 3:00\u20133:30 | <3:00 |\n| Sled Push 50m | 4:00\u20135:00 | 3:00\u20133:30 | 2:30\u20133:00 | <2:30 |\n| Sled Pull 50m | 3:30\u20134:30 | 2:30\u20133:15 | 2:00\u20132:30 | <2:00 |\n| Burpee Broad Jump 80m | 7:00\u20138:30 | 6:00\u20137:00 | 5:00\u20136:00 | <5:00 |\n| Row 1000m | 5:00\u20135:30 | 4:00\u20134:45 | 3:30\u20134:00 | <3:30 |\n| Farmers Carry 200m | 2:30\u20133:30 | 2:00\u20132:30 | 1:45\u20132:00 | <1:45 |\n| Lunges 100m | 5:30\u20137:00 | 4:30\u20135:30 | 3:45\u20134:30 | <3:45 |\n| Wall Balls 100 reps | 6:00\u20137:00 | 4:00\u20135:00 | 3:30\u20134:00 | <3:30 |\n\n*Times are isolated (fresh) station times. Add 15\u201330% for race-day estimates under fatigue.*\n\n---\n\n### 2.4 Decision Points: AI Coach Decision Rules\n\nThese if/then rules enable automated coaching adjustments based on test results and ongoing monitoring data.\n\n---\n\n**Rule 1: Aerobic Gains, Station Stagnation**\n> **IF** Cooper test improves by \u2265150m over 8 weeks **BUT** station times (sled push, wall balls, farmers carry) stagnate or worsen \u2192\n> **THEN** Shift 2 weekly training sessions from pure running to concurrent training: station-specific strength-endurance circuits (e.g., sled push + wall balls + farmers carry at race weight, 3\u20134 rounds, with 1km run between rounds). Aerobic base is sufficient; the limiter is now muscular endurance under fatigue.\n\n---\n\n**Rule 2: Strength Up, Run Pace Down**\n> **IF** squat and deadlift 3RM improve by \u22658% over 8 weeks **BUT** 30-min time trial pace slows by \u22655 sec/km \u2192\n> **THEN** Likely concurrent training interference. Reduce strength training frequency from 4\u20135 to 3 sessions/week. Separate running and strength sessions by \u22656 hours. Ensure carbohydrate intake on training days is \u22656 g/kg. Move heavy strength to AM; run sessions to PM (or vice versa). Prioritize running volume in the current mesocycle.\n\n---\n\n**Rule 3: Performance Plateau (3+ Weeks)**\n> **IF** athlete shows <1% improvement in any primary metric (Cooper test, 30-min TT, or 2+ station times) for 3+ consecutive weeks despite consistent training \u2192\n> **THEN** Implement a structured stimulus change block (2 weeks): (a) Swap training modalities (replace steady runs with fartlek; replace standard strength with unilateral/tempo work). (b) Introduce a novel stressor (hill sprints, altitude mask, sled sprint intervals). (c) If HRV/RHR show no suppression \u2192 the athlete is *undertrained*, not overtrained \u2014 increase training intensity by 10% for the next mesocycle.\n\n---\n\n**Rule 4: HRV Crash Protocol**\n> **IF** HRV drops >1.5 SD below the 14-day rolling mean for 3+ consecutive days AND resting HR is elevated \u22655 bpm \u2192\n> **THEN** Activate Reactive Deload Protocol (Section 1.4). Cancel all high-intensity sessions. Replace with Zone 1 only. Add 1 extra rest day. Increase sleep target to 9+ hours. Retest HRV daily. Do not return to normal programming until HRV returns to within 0.5 SD of baseline for 2 consecutive days.\n\n---\n\n**Rule 5: Running Improves, SkiErg/Row Stagnate**\n> **IF** 30-min TT improves by \u2265200m **BUT** SkiErg and/or Row 1000m times do not improve \u2192\n> **THEN** The limiter is upper body pulling endurance, not aerobic capacity. Add 2\u00d7 weekly SkiErg/Row interval sessions: 6 \u00d7 250m at goal race pace with 90 sec rest; OR 4 \u00d7 500m at threshold pace with 2 min rest. Add supplementary lat, tricep, and posterior chain work (lat pulldowns, tricep dips, prone rows).\n\n---\n\n**Rule 6: Single-Station Bottleneck**\n> **IF** one station time is >25% slower than the athlete's percentile rank in all other stations \u2192\n> **THEN** Designate that station as the \"limiter station.\" Allocate 3 specific sessions/week to that station for 4 weeks. Approach: 1 technique session (low weight, perfect form, video analysis), 1 capacity session (race weight, pacing practice), 1 endurance session (above race weight or extended reps/distance). Retest after 4 weeks.\n\n---\n\n**Rule 7: Weight Loss + Performance Decline**\n> **IF** bodyweight drops >2% in 2 weeks AND performance metrics decline (any test) AND athlete is not intentionally cutting \u2192\n> **THEN** Flag RED-S risk (Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport). Immediately increase caloric intake by 300\u2013500 kcal/day with emphasis on carbohydrates. Reduce training volume by 20%. Screen for disordered eating patterns (refer to sport dietitian if available). Do not increase training volume until weight stabilizes.\n\n---\n\n**Rule 8: Grip Failure Pattern**\n> **IF** Farmers Carry time includes >2 drops AND/OR Sled Pull time is >30% slower than Sled Push (relative to benchmarks) \u2192\n> **THEN** Grip strength is the limiter. Prescribe: (a) Farmers carry holds 3\u00d7/week: 3 \u00d7 45 sec at race weight, building to 3 \u00d7 75 sec. (b) Towel hangs or fat grip work 2\u00d7/week. (c) Forearm roller or rice bucket work daily. (d) Rope climbing or rope pull variations 1\u20132\u00d7/week.\n\n---\n\n**Rule 9: Sled Push Catastrophe Signal**\n> **IF** Sled Push time is >2\u00d7 the athlete's row time (e.g., Row 4:30 but Sled Push 9:00+) \u2192\n> **THEN** Lower body strength is critically insufficient. Reprioritize programming: increase squat and leg press volume by 30%, add heavy prowler/sled sessions 2\u00d7/week at sub-race weight building to race weight. Temporarily reduce running volume by 15% to accommodate. Retest sled push every 3 weeks until it falls below 1.5\u00d7 row time.\n\n---\n\n**Rule 10: Positive Adaptation Confirmation**\n> **IF** Cooper test improves \u2265100m AND 30-min TT improves \u2265200m AND \u22654 of 8 station times improve \u22655% AND bodyweight is stable (\u00b11 kg) AND HRV is trending upward over 4-week block \u2192\n> **THEN** Training plan is working. Maintain current programming structure for 1 more mesocycle (3\u20134 weeks) before introducing the next progressive overload phase. Document the winning recipe (session split, volume, intensity distribution) as this athlete's \"known good\" template for future reference.\n\n---\n\n**Rule 11: Race Simulation Readiness Check**\n> **IF** athlete is \u22644 weeks from race day AND has not completed a full race simulation (8 stations + 8km running in sequence) \u2192\n> **THEN** Schedule a full or partial simulation (minimum: 4 stations + 4km) within the next 10 days. Use race weights. Record all split times. This is the single most valuable session in the final training block \u2014 it calibrates pacing, identifies nutrition needs, and builds psychological confidence. Taper begins after this session.\n\n---\n\n**Rule 12: Sleep Crisis Override**\n> **IF** athlete reports <6 hours sleep for 3+ consecutive nights (regardless of all other metrics) \u2192\n> **THEN** Override all training prescriptions. Replace any planned high-intensity or heavy strength session with Zone 1 active recovery or complete rest. Sleep debt accumulates non-linearly \u2014 3 nights of 5.5 hours creates more deficit than one night of 3 hours. Address the root cause (stress, schedule, sleep hygiene) before restoring training load. Growth hormone secretion, glycogen repletion, and motor consolidation are all compromised (Charest & Grandner, 2020; Mougin et al., 2001).\n\n---\n\n## Key References\n\n- Aragon, A.A. & Schoenfeld, B.J.
