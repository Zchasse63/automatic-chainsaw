          "snippet": "Unfortunately, longitudinal flexibility is compromised, which means more work is needed in foot-bending movements like lunges. Those who prefer more natural movement should find a more flexible pair.\n\n### Pros\n\n- Durable upper and outsole\n\n- Spacious upper fit\n\n- Enhanced midsole comfort\n\n- Great value at $225 for a supershoe\n\n- Versatile across all paces\n\n- Ideal for heel strikers\n\n- More stable than ever\n\n### Cons\n\n- Slightly heavier than v3\n\n- Less suited for forefoot strikers\n\n- Competitors may feel quicker\n\n## HYROX shoes with the best traction\n\n### What makes it the best?\n\nThe PUMA Deviate Nitro Elite 3 feels electric with each takeoff, thanks to its light and springy midsole, followed by well-cushioned landings care of its dreamy cushioning we verified in the lab. Yet what makes it stand out the most is its sticky PumaGrip rubber, giving us the best grip we could find in HYROX running shoes.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Pros\n\n- Superb Nitro Elite foam\n\n- Breathable, lightweight upper\n\n- Extremely responsive\n\n- More affordable than most supershoes\n\n- Outstanding grip\n\n- Great comfort for a racer\n\n- Major improvements from v2\n\n- Fast, agile, race-ready performance\n\n- Fantastic tongue\n\n### Cons\n\n- Not the best for heel strikers\n\n- Durability concerns\n\n- Lacks stability for some runners\n\n## HYROX shoes with the best energy return\n\n### What makes it the best?\n\nRunning plays a major role in HYROX, and we believe the Saucony Endorphin Speed 5 allowed us to smash the 1-km portions by offering the best energy return among HYROX running shoes. In the lab, we discovered it features the top-level PWRRUN PB foam, which explains its responsiveness, comfort, and lightness. Meanwhile, its nylon plate and SPEEDROLL geometry create smooth yet centered strides.\n\n\u2026\n\nComplementing powerful toe-offs are plush landings, care of the shoe\u2019s high shock absorption, which we verified in the lab. The heel returned 132 SA and the forefoot 108 SA, both comfortably exceeding their respective averages, which means the midsole offers superior impact protection.\n\nThe nylon plate and SPEEDROLL technology promote effortless forward movement and enhance stability. Lab tests show that torsionally, the base offers resistance with its 4/5 rating, but longitudinally, it\u2019s 14.6% more pliable than average. This creates a well-planted yet versatile ride.\nIt\u2019s hard not to love this shoe, and the only test it failed was the toebox durability test. Those who want a sturdier upper should go for another shoe.\n\n### Pros\n\n- Supershoe-like energy return\n\n- Fantastic upper with top-notch ventilation\n\n- Softer PWRRUN PB foam\n\n- Endorphin Speed DNA still present\n\n- Great lockdown\n\n- Versatile for multiple paces\n\n- Smooth SPEEDROLL rocker\n\n- Roomier and taller toebox\n\n- Can be used for racing too\n\n- OG special colorway looks fantastic!\n\n\u2026\n\n### What makes it the best?\n\nAmong HYROX running shoes we tested inside the gym and our lab, the Hoka Mach 6 stands out for its stability. It\u2019s an all-rounder that offers structure for lateral movements, responsiveness for runs, and flexibility for other foot-bending exercises.\n\nWe didn\u2019t expect much from its narrow midsole and plush cushioning, but the Mach 6 feels exceptionally stable. It\u2019s highly resistant to twisting, which kept our feet centered and secured. In our manual twist test, we confirmed its rigidity with a high 4/5 rating.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe midsole feels bouncy and energetic, allowing us to shave off time during the 1-km run portions. Using our standardized test, the heel offers a remarkable 67.5% energy return, while the forefoot surprised us with its 74.2% score. Both performed better than the lab average, proving the shoe's responsiveness. With a solid shock absorption score of 136 SA in the heel, it\u2019s able to reduce the forces of road running and repetitive jumping by 5.0% vs. average.\nNote that the toebox area feels snug. We recommend those with broad or high-volume feet to try more accommodating trainers.\n\n### Pros\n\n- Impressive energy return\n\n- Lightweight and agile underfoot\n\n- Superior traction from PumaGrip outsole\n\n- Handles tempo efforts with ease\n\n- Flexible and comfortable for everyday use\n\n- Accurate real drop\n\n- Natural-feeling, non-rockered design\n\n- Balanced cushioning with some ground feel\n\n- Looks really cool\n\n### Cons\n\n- Not ideal for long runs\n\n- Fit leans toward the narrow side\n\n- Midsole becomes firmer in cold conditions\n\n- Slight price increase\n\n\u2026\n\nUsing our caliper, we measured the 27.5/22.7 mm stack to be tall for a trainer but low for a running shoe. Despite its grounded profile, the midsole took care of our muscles and joints with enough shock absorption (104 SA in the heel and 90 SA in the forefoot). What makes it even better for the 1-km segments is its strong energy return, scoring 71.6% in the heel and 71.1% in the forefoot.\n\n\u2026\n\n## What makes a good HYROX shoe\n\nThe shoe choice for HYROX is complicated by the fact that this race combines running with functional fitness exercises. The two involve entirely different biomechanics and mutually exclusive shoe characteristics.\n\nOn the one hand, you need a\n\n**fast, cushioned, and light shoe with great energy return** to run the 1 km sprints in between each workstation (8 km in total). After all, the goal of the race is to complete the entire course as quickly as possible.\n\n\u2026\n\n### 1. Excellent outsole grip\n\nMore specifically, grip on:\n\n**Artificial carpet-style turf**. Most functional fitness stations in HYROX are covered with a specifically designed turf surface called the Centr x HYROX Perform Turf. **Polished concrete, smooth wood, or rubberized indoor track surfacing**. Depending on the HYROX venue, these are the most common surfaces for running splits. **Rubber flooring**. Transition zones and some stations (wall balls, row, ski) are covered with rubber mats. **Wet floor**. It should also be noted that the venue flooring can get wet from sweat during the meet.\n\n\u2026\n\n- Moderate stack height\n\n- Moderately soft or firm cushioning\n\n- Decently wide base\n\nWe highly recommend choosing HYROX shoes with a\n\n** heel stack of 30-38 mm**. This setup provides enough cushioning without making you feel too disconnected from the ground or compromising stability.\n\nThe HYROX competition rules don't put any cap on the shoe\u2019s stack height, but choosing shoes with a 40+ mm heel stack comes with a price, as you are:\n- sacrificing stability at the weighted stations\n\n- raising your chances of getting injured\n\n- making it harder for some reps to count (i.e., sandbag lunges only count if your knee makes contact with the ground, which can be harder to do on a taller platform)\n\n- potentially losing seconds fitting your thick-foamed shoe into the rower\u2019s heel cup\n\n\u2026\n\n### 3. Good energy return\n\nSuper shoes entice HYROX athletes with their advanced PEBA (or other supercritical foam) and carbon (or nylon plates), which provide exceptional energy return during the running splits of HYROX.\n\nYes, these shoes feel notably bouncier and make toe-offs feel extra springy and propelling. But do you necessarily need a super shoe (or a carbon-plated shoe for that matter) to compete in HYROX? Not at all!\n\n\u2026\n\nThe average forefoot flexibility of HYROX shoes hovers around 13N, which is a perfectly balanced setup for this competition, in our opinion. However, some popular carbon-plated models reach as much as 25N, which can be too rigid for some athletes.\n\n### 5. Heel shape\n\nBecause one of the HYROX stations involves a rowing machine, you want to choose shoes with a more traditional, rounded heel shape.\n\nStay away from shoes with unconventional heel designs or protruding (flared) elements that don\u2019t fit into the Concept2 rower heel cups.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Heel lockdown\n\nA good HYROX shoe will provide a comfortably snug and secure rearfoot experience, minimizing the risk of heel slippage and ankle wobbling. This is especially important for sled pushes when you are exerting force on your tiptoes.\n\nIf you are a beginner, choose shoes with\n\n**moderately stiff and padded heel counters **as they provide a good amount of rearfoot support and lockdown. An extra pair of eyelets may come in handy as well if you use **a heel lock lacing for a more secure fit**.\n\n\u2026\n\n**Toebox durability:** The exposed mesh uppers of running shoes weren\u2019t meant for high-impact slashes against rough floors either. Buprees and sandbag lunges can cause some serious tears in the upper material, but we are here to assess each HYROX shoe\u2019s toebox on a 1-5 durability scale.\n\n**Heel padding durability:** Sled pushes, lunges, and wall balls all cause more friction in the collar area than regular running. That\u2019s why we also apply our Dremel test to the lining inside each shoe\u2019s heel collar.",

Combining 8 x 1km runs with functional workouts like sled pushes, rowing, wall balls, and burpee broad jumps, HYROX is the ultimate test of hybrid athleticism. And just like you wouldn\u2019t train upper body day in a pair of deadlift shoes, you shouldn't take on a HYROX event without the right footwear.\nIn this guide, we\u2019ll break down how choosing the\n\n**right HYROX shoes** can elevate your performance, help prevent injury, and give you the edge you need to dominate race day.\n\n\n\n**Why Footwear Matters in HYROX**\n\nUnlike traditional running races or CrossFit competitions, HYROX is uniquely demanding because it mixes endurance with explosive power and high-rep functional movements. That means your shoes need to:\n- Handle repetitive running on concrete or rubber surfaces\n\n- Offer grip and stability for sled pushes, lunges, and burpees\n\n- Absorb shock during high-impact transitions\n\n- Support agility and lateral movement\n\nThe wrong shoe choice can slow you down\u2014or worse, lead to injury. The\n\n**right hybrid training shoes** can help you move faster, feel stronger, and recover better.\n\n\u2026\n\n**Lightweight and Responsive Feel**\n\nSpeed matters. Choose a shoe with a\n\n**responsive ride** that feels light underfoot, so you can transition smoothly from run to workout.\n\n\n\n**Top Picks for HYROX Athletes**\n\nAt\n\n**Island Run Club**, we\u2019ve curated the best options for hybrid athletes.

I wore the v3 when I competed in Hyrox Berlin last year and from the moment I left the start line, they offered me the perfect level of support, with zero slippage. The latest Deviate Nitro 4 is even better. Puma has really nailed the midsole, creating a balanced ride that feels soft enough for easier miles, but firm enough to suit the uptempo running that Deviate Nitro shoes are known for delivering. Plus, they feel light on the foot.\n\n\u2026\n\n**Editor's note:** We're currently in the process of testing the Endorphin Pro 5, but until we have feedback from our wear testers, the Pro 4 remains our top option.\n\n## Key specs\n\n|Weight|212g (M), 185g (W)|\n|--|--|\n|Stack height|39.5mm (heel), 31.5mm (forefoot)|\n|Drop|8mm|\n|Type|Neutral|\n|Carbon plate|Yes|",

          "snippet": "For this reason, I think CrossFit shoes \u2013 like the Puma Fuse or Nike Metcon\u2019s \u2013 aren\u2019t appropriate for HYROX. Whilst they are comfortable in general, have good grip, and would be great for the functional exercises, they just wouldn\u2019t be comfortable enough for 8km+ of running, or perform as well as other trainers might. Running shoes are far more appropriate.\n\n\u2026\n\n*Tip \u2013 if you haven\u2019t entered a HYROX before, when testing the shoes on a sled push, make it heavier than you\u2019re expecting it to be.*\n\n*Super Shoes*\n\nA lot of the more expensive racing \u201csuper shoes\u201d being brought to the market are great for running but\n\n*may* not be appropriate for HYROX. One of the reasons for this is the lack of grip many of them provide. Often they are simply designed for running long distances in. Therefore, the companies minimise the amount the shoe weighs by sacrificing rubber on the outsole. It\u2019s certainly something to check out before making an expensive purchase.\n\n\u2026\n\nIt delivers a responsive, race-ready feel that excels in the running segments, with the updated NITROFOAM\u2122 ELITE providing a snappy, propulsive ride without feeling overly harsh. The PUMAGRIP outsole offers excellent traction, making it particularly effective for the sled push and pull. The trade-off is a relatively narrow platform and high stack height, which can feel less stable under heavy lateral forces compared to flatter trainers \u2013 though in HYROX, this is rarely a limiting factor.\n\n\u2026\n\nIts PWRRUN HG foam, paired with a full-length carbon plate, delivers a propulsive ride and smooth roll thanks to Saucony\u2019s SPEEDROLL geometry. Grip is solid for the sled push and pull, while the broader forefoot platform offers a touch more stability than many super shoes. Durability is decent for a race shoe, with reinforced outsole rubber improving lifespan compared to earlier models, though it doesn\u2019t feel quite as cushioned as the Endorphin Pro 3 \u2013 a model that was extremely popular among early adopters in the sport.",

          "snippet": "HYROX is a unique race. Equal parts running and functional strength, it presents a formidable challenge to any shoe. If your footwear doesn\u2019t match the task, you\u2019ll feel it, whether that\u2019s during a 1,000-meter run or while driving a 275-pound sled.\n\nThis article explores the real-world performance of both training shoes and running shoes in a HYROX context. I personally tested several pairs of each across strength training, HYROX-style workouts, and dedicated runs. I also included standout models based on expert recommendations, athlete feedback, and research.\nAs a performance coach at Rypt and HYROX athlete Jacob Ruch, CSCS, told me, \u201cHYROX is a running race accumulating 5+ miles; comfort, stability, and then grip, in that order, should drive your shoe choice.\u201d\n\nWhether you\u2019re a HYROX rookie or a competitive hybrid athlete, here\u2019s what you need to know before lacing up.\n\n## What to Consider When Choosing HYROX Shoes\n\nHYROX puts your shoes to the test in ways most training or running sessions never will. Each event in the race challenges your grip, stability, endurance, and responsiveness. When comparing shoes for HYROX, I focused on four key performance factors, each essential for completing all eight stations and the 8K of running between them.\n\n\u2026\n\n**Stability:**Movements like lunges and sled pushes require a solid base. I prioritized shoes with firm midsoles and secure heel support to ensure control under load and during quick transitions. \u201cStability is critical for exercises requiring balance and strength under load,\u201d Ruch adds. \u201cWithout it, you\u2019re leaking power and risking injury.\u201d\n\nEach shoe in this review was evaluated against these criteria across both training and simulated HYROX efforts, providing a comprehensive picture of how it performs when every second and step count.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe goal was to test how each shoe transitioned between running and strength work, just like in a real HYROX race. **Two One-Mile Runs:**Finally, I ran a pair of controlled one-mile efforts in each shoe to evaluate comfort, responsiveness, and running economy. This provided a clear indication of how the shoe performed under repetitive, steady-state impact.\n\nThis structure allowed me to assess each shoe across both cardio and strength dimensions, and under real-world conditions. From turf grip during sled pushes to midfoot fatigue during runs, nothing was left untested.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Training Shoes vs. Running Shoes: Which One Suits HYROX the Best?\n\n### Training Shoes\n\nTraining shoes were designed for the gym, providing a stable platform for lifts, change-of-direction drills, and ground-based movements. Here\u2019s how they held up during HYROX testing.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Solid grip and traction during sled push/pull\n\n- Superior stability for lunges, wall balls, and burpees\n\n- Lower to the ground, which aids balance and control\n\n- Typically more durable across turf and concrete surfaces\n\n\u2026\n\n**Performance Breakdown:** The Free Metcon 6 combines flexibility with structure, making it ideal for explosive stations and transitional strength exercises. It offers a snug fit and a firm platform that excels in multi-directional movements. While it excels at gym-based work, its minimal cushioning and tighter build make it less ideal for distances over 800 meters of running. Best for short intervals or strength-heavy HYROX sessions.\n\n**Product Highlights:** **Price:**$125 **Weight:**274g (M) **Heel-to-Toe Drop:**7.2mm **Stack Height:**22mm (heel), 14.8mm (forefoot)\n\n\u2026\n\n**Performance Breakdown:** The Pegasus 41 feels light, springy, and smooth through every stride, making it a standout on the run segments of HYROX. It delivers great energy return and impact absorption across the 1K intervals. That said, the soft midsole and narrow build compromise its stability under tension. Expect excellent performance during the running sections, but reduced control when moving through loaded strength stations.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Nike Pegasus Plus\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Well-cushioned for long efforts\n\n- Breathable and lightweight upper\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Lacks lateral stability\n\n- Limited grip on turf and rubber flooring\n**Performance Breakdown:** The Nike Pegasus Plus delivers a soft, smooth ride that feels great during HYROX-style runs, especially for heel strikers or athletes used to road shoes. The Zoom Air cushioning helps reduce impact across repeated intervals, and the lightweight upper keeps your feet cool even during extended sessions. However, the shoe doesn\u2019t provide much lateral support, and traction can feel sketchy during sled pushes, burpees, or lunges. It\u2019s a solid option for run-focused athletes but may fall short during strength-heavy segments. Shop Men\u2019s Shop Women\u2019s\n\n\u2026\n\n### Reebok Nano X5\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Stable heel and wide forefoot\n\n- Rugged outsole with excellent traction\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- On the heavier side for running\n\n- Stiff during toe-off\n**Performance Breakdown:** The Nano X5 is a workhorse. It offers excellent grip and support through sled work, wall balls, and lateral stations. The upper is breathable, and the heel stability gives you confidence under load. Where it falters is running, especially over longer distances. The shoe\u2019s rigidity and weight slow your transition and reduce running comfort, though it\u2019s a strong pick for athletes who want a strength-first shoe that can run when needed.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Reebok Floatzig 2\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Lightweight and energetic ride\n\n- More stable than typical running shoes\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Limited grip on turf\n\n- Lacks side-to-side support\n\n**Performance Breakdown:** Designed with runners in mind, the Floatzig 2 surprised during hybrid efforts. It\u2019s light, responsive, and more versatile than expected thanks to a flatter platform and stable heel. However, its outsole struggles with turf grip, and lateral movements feel less secure. Best for athletes who lean more toward run performance but still want some hybrid functionality. Shop Men\u2019s Shop Women\u2019s\n\n\u2026\n\n### Puma Deviate Nitro 3\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- High rebound and propulsion\n\n- Feels fast and race-ready\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Narrow fit\n\n- Not built for loaded strength work\n\n**Performance Breakdown:** This is a purebred running shoe that feels snappy and efficient. The Deviate Nitro 3 flies through 1K segments and will appeal to endurance athletes crossing into HYROX. But the carbon plate and high stack make it less trustworthy for turf-based work or weighted stations. Best suited for hybrid athletes who prioritize speed and running over weightlifting.\n\n\u2026\n\n### HOKA Kawana 2\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Smooth and soft ride for longer runs\n\n- A wide platform offers natural stability\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Slightly bulky for transitions\n\n- Less responsive under heavy load\n\n\u2026\n\n### Brooks Ghost 17\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Cushioned yet stable\n\n- Great option for heel strikers\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Lacks lockdown grip for fast changes of direction\n\n- A bit too soft for sled or sandbag work\n\n**Performance Breakdown:** The Ghost 17 is a reliable daily trainer with above-average stability for a running shoe. Its moderate cushioning suits longer runs, while its relatively flat platform helps it feel grounded through functional movements. Still, it lacks grip and lateral control for aggressive strength stations. Ideal for beginners or athletes easing into HYROX-style training.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Saucony Endorphin Pro 4\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Fast, efficient, and built for speed\n\n- Excellent for time trial pacing\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Too unstable for lateral or loaded movements\n\n- A narrow platform can feel unstable under fatigue\n\n\u2026\n\n**Product Highlights:** **Price:**$240 **Weight:**~ 212g (M), ~ 185g (W) **Heel-to-Toe Drop:**8mm **Stack Height:**39.5mm (heel), 31.5mm (forefoot)\n\n**Nike Vomero Plus**\n\n**Pros:**\n- Plush, ultra\u2011responsive ZoomX foam delivers excellent energy return\n\n- Softer and lighter than the Vomero 18, with similar stack height\n\n- Stable ride despite thick cushioning; spacious forefoot in wide options\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Outsole rubber is softer than ideal; it may wear faster in high\u2011abrasion zones\n\n- Tongue design doesn\u2019t lie flat; slightly chunky\n**Performance Breakdown:**\n\nThe Vomero Plus is Nike\u2019s\n\n*max\u2011cushion do\u2011it\u2011all trainer*, pairing a full\u2011length ZoomX midsole with a wide, stable platform. It delivers plush comfort for recovery and long runs while keeping the ride controlled, thanks to a refined rocker design. While the soft outsole rubber may wear faster and the tongue feels bulky, the overall mix of cushioning, stability, and responsiveness makes it one of Nike\u2019s most versatile trainers.\n\n\u2026\n\n# Ranked Best 2025 Shoe for HYROX Training\n\n### Best Overall for HYROX: Puma Deviate Nitro 3\n\nFast, responsive, and race-ready, the Puma Deviate Nitro 3 offers excellent propulsion and lightweight comfort, making it perfect for athletes seeking top performance across running and functional training stations.\n\n### Best Training Shoe: R.A.D One V2\n\nGreat balance of grip, control, and durability. Ideal for athletes who want a single shoe for training and race day.\n\n### Best for Competitive Runners: Nike Pegasus 41\n\nLightweight, breathable, and efficient. Perfect for athletes who want to dominate the 1K segments.\n\n### Best Hybrid Option: Reebok Floatzig 2\n\nLight and versatile with just enough support to move between cardio and strength work without a shoe swap.\n\n**Best Budget Pick:** Brooks Ghost 17\n\nWell-cushioned and stable enough for beginner hybrid workouts at a lower price point.\n\n## The Final Stretch\n\nAs HYROX continues to grow worldwide, expect more brands to engineer footwear tailored for hybrid athletes. Until then, your shoe selection comes down to how you train and what matters most to you on race day.\n\nNo single shoe can dominate every station. But with the right pair, or even a two-shoe strategy, you can feel more confident, reduce injury risk, and perform at your best from the first 1K to the final wall ball.",

          "snippet": "We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.\n\nFrom sled technique to erg efficiency, lap counting to doubles strategising, the key to Hyrox success is in the preparation. But one thing that can make or break your race regardless of how well prepared you are is your choice of footwear.\n\nThe best shoes for Hyrox are those that balance speed, grip and stability, propelling you forward on the runs while offering enough traction on the sleds and stability on the lunges, burpees and wall balls.\n\n\u2026\n\nWhy it makes for such an effective Hyrox shoe lies in its versatility. Puma's PWRPLATE carbon plate and NITROFOAM Elite foam midsole combine to provide a quick and responsive yet cushioned ride, while still retaining a relatively lightweight feel. The 39mm stack height and 10mm drop is high, but any instability is mitigated by a robust heel counter, while the rubber PUMAGRIP outsole offers excellent traction on a range of surfaces.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Cons\n\n- Not the fastest\n\nThe Nike Zoom Pegasus 41 is an excellent option for those wanting a do-it-all trainer that'll give you a good amount of speed to race in, but much more in the way of stability and grip than a super shoe.\n\nThe speed and cushioning come courtesy of the ZoomX and ReactX foams in the midsole. The stack height is modest, but the 10mm heel-t0-toe drop gives the shoe a performance-oriented feel.\nThe Zoom Pegasus 41 also has a pretty aggressive waffle-shaped outsole, which is great news for Hyrox athletes needing traction.\n\nThis is essentially a great entry-level shoe. You probably won't be setting any records in it, but its combination of responsiveness, stability and grip will pay dividends on the runs and each of the eight stations.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Cons\n\n- Not a do-it-all shoe\n\nThe Adidas Adizero Boston 12 has all the qualities to be a universally appealing shoe for Hyrox. It's light, versatile and geared up for speed, while still possessing a good level of stability and, importantly, a durable and grippy rubber outsole.\n\n\u2026\n\nFor traction, the Continental rubber outsole is provides the necessary grip, with good coverage across the forefoot and heel. As for stability, the width in the forefoot and layered foam midsole combine to give the shoe a relatively study and balanced feel.\n\nIf your foot type matches neutral-style shoes and you want something that's quick, grippy and durable for Hyrox races that you can also use for your weekly tempo and interval training on the road, the Adizero Boston 12 is a well balanced choice.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Speed\n\nIf you're entering a Hyrox with the intention of setting a fast time, speed on the runs is key. For that, you might want to consider a shoe with a carbon plate and to prioritise shoes that favour responsiveness over stability.\n\nThe Puma x Hyrox Deviate Nitro 3 is probably the best and most well-balanced Hyrox shoe with a carbon plate for most people. It's not as quick as the Deviate Nitro Elite or some of the other super shoes road runners wear, but it's plenty for most participants looking for speed\n*and* stability.\n\nBut a carbon plate certainly isn't the be all and end all. Most daily running shoes now possess enough speed to get your through a Hyrox in a competitive time. Going without one will also give you more by way of stability.",

Don't buy your next gym shoe until you watch this!\n\n\u2026\n\nWhether you're lifting\n{ts:20} heavy, hitting Metcons, or just curious about trying something different from the usual Nike or Reebok, the CXT1 is a\n{ts:28} fresh contender that's well worth your attention. So, what's the deal with TYR's first major training shoe?\nLet's\n{ts:36} start with its standout feature, stability. The CX-T1 delivers an incredibly solid base thanks to its\n{ts:43} patent pending Surge NRG foam midsole and a highdensity heel. This combo gives you excellent ground feedback while\n{ts:52} still offering just enough cushioning to stay comfortable through longer sessions.\nWhether you're squatting deep\n{ts:57} or doing power cleans, the shoe keeps you locked in and supported. Second, the grip on these things is serious. Tyr\n{ts:66} outfitted the outsole with a durable rubber tread that sticks to various gym surfaces like glue. From turf sled\n{ts:73} pushes to aggressive lateral movements, the traction holds strong and inspires confidence.\nIf your workouts involve a\n{ts:81} mix of explosive and controlled movement, this kind of grip is a real gamecher.\n{ts:87} Now, let's talk comfort and fit. The upper is a breathable mesh with a structured design that hugs your foot\n{ts:93} without feeling restrictive.\nThere's also a well- padded collar and tongue, giving you that snug, dialedin feel.\n{ts:101} Plus, the wider toe box provides room for natural toe splay. A must for heavy lifters and anyone who doesn't like a\n{ts:108} cramped fit. Another huge win is durability.\nFrom the reinforced sidewalls to the tough upper materials,\n{ts:115} the CXT-1 is clearly built to last. It's designed with highintensity athletes in mind, and it shows. If you're training\n{ts:123} multiple times a week and putting your shoes through constant abuse, the CXT1 holds its own without breaking down\n{ts:130} quickly. But no shoe is without flaws. First, the CXT1's break-in period can feel a bit stiff, especially around the\n{ts:138} heel and midfoot. you'll likely need a few sessions before it truly molds to your movement. Second, at its current\n{ts:145} price point, it's positioned as a premium training shoe, which might make some buyers hesitate, especially when\n{ts:152} competing against long-standing names in the category. To wrap it up, the TYR CXT1 trainer is an impressive debut in\n{ts:161} the performance footwear space. It offers top tier stability, excellent grip, smart construction, and a look\n{ts:167} that feels both clean and bold.\nWhile it may not be the most budget friendly or instantly comfortable out of the box, it\n{ts:175} shines where it matters most, performance and durability. If you're ready to try something outside the\n{ts:181} typical brands and want a shoe that can match your training intensity, the CXT1 just might surprise you in the best",

          "snippet": "**Summary**\n\nThis definitive Hyrox equipment guide equips athletes to conquer every station\u2014from selecting running shoes that balance 8 km speed with sled-push stability, to mastering sled technique, grip-saving chalk strategies, and kettlebell/dumbbell workouts that mirror race-day movements.\nReaders learn how the right heel stack, energy-return midsoles, and 60 %+ energy-return foams shave minutes off total time, why burpee-broad-jump mats and sweat-proof hand protection prevent 3\u20135 % time drains, and how resistance-band mobility rituals and progressive dumbbell snatches, deadlifts, and farmer\u2019s carries build the specific strength that powers SkiErg pulls, wall-ball squats, and heavy sled pushes and pulls.\nThe article unpacks wall-ball specs (6\u20139 kg, 9\u201310 ft targets, 75\u2013100 reps), hydration science (300\u20131 000 mg sodium/liter to counter 1\u20131.5 L sweat loss), and timing-chip logistics, then delivers a champion\u2019s packing checklist\u2014shoes, bib, ankle chip, soft-flask electrolytes, anti-chafe, recovery clothes\u2014so nothing is left to chance. By turning gear choices into measurable performance gains, the piece shows why meticulous equipment prep is the easiest way to turn training devotion into a new personal best on race day.\n\n## Building Your Hyrox Equipment List: Core Gear Essentials\n\nPick a 7\u201310 oz shoe with textured rubber lugs, a 30\u201338 mm stable heel and 60 %+ energy-return foam to keep your footing on sleds and your speed between stations.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Preparing and Packing Your Hyrox Equipment List\n\nLay out every battle-tested item\u2014from fuel-packed gels to backup socks\u2014the night before so race morning feels like a confident march to the start line, not a frantic scavenger hunt.\n\n\u2026\n\nAs covered in our footwear section, those trusted shoes you've conquered multiple workouts in belong front and center. Pack your secret weapons: mobility tools like a lacrosse ball and foam roller that'll keep you moving fluidly from warm-up through recovery\n\n. Your backpack becomes your mobile command center with essentials like a complete change of clothes (yes, extra socks are non-negotiable), flip-flops for post-victory comfort, body wipes, protein fuel, phone charger, and a victory bag for sweaty gear . For hydration strategy (detailed in our electrolyte section), have your preferred mix ready to go.\n\n\u2026\n\nHydrate early: 2% fluid loss cuts power 10\u201315%; aim for 300\u20131000mg sodium/L via soft flasks between stations.\n\nSecure timing chip on right ankle, pin color-coded bib front, arrive 90min early for smooth check-in.\n\nPack night before: race kit, backup socks, pre-mixed electrolytes, anti-chafe, tape, and post-race recovery gear.",

The race was \ndesigned by Mintra Tilly, who also wrote the rulebook.\nHYROX consists of a 1 km run followed by 1 station, \nrepeated 8 times. In order to complete the entire \nHYROX race and receive a valid finishing time, the \nracers must complete the runs and stations in the \nspecific order [Run 1, workout station 1, Run 2, \nworkout station 2, etc.] until they have completed a \ntotal of 8 km running and 8 stations.\nWhilst the repetition range and/or weights differ \nbetween the divisions, the running distance remains \nthe same across all divisions: each racer must run 1 \nkm before each, i.e. a total distance of 8 km.\nThe results and ranking system are based on the \nfastest time in each respective division.

          "snippet": "**What gear do real HYROX athletes rely on?**\n\nWe asked 45 members from our community \u2014 including coaches, members, and co-founders Josh and Andrew \u2014 to share exactly what they wear and bring on race day. From shoes and socks to tech and apparel we measured what our community packs in their gear bag.\n\nNow, before we kick things off, a quick note on the data. This is a small-sample, community-driven survey \u2014 not a global consensus. 66.7% of respondents were female, which definitely shaped some of the results (especially apparel). For example, Lululemon scored high, but mostly among women. These insights are a snapshot of our community, and we\u2019ll keep refining the data as more athletes weigh in.\n\n## Best HYROX Shoes 2025\n\nFootwear is easily the most talked-about topic in HYROX circles\u2014for good reason. This isn\u2019t just a road race or a gym workout. You\u2019re running 8 km, stopping to push sleds, lunge, and burpee broad jump. Your shoes have to do it all: grip turf, handle impact, and stay comfortable under fatigue.\n\nIn our survey, lightweight design edged out traction as the top priority by a hair. So what attributes make up the ideal HYROX shoe? Based on the data, it seems like our athletes are looking for race-day shoe that feels fast and nimble, but still provides enough grip for sled work with plenty of stability and cushioning.\n\nSo which shoes delivered on those priorities?\n\nTwo models from PUMA stood out in our results, especially among athletes training at Resilience. The Deviate Nitro 3 and Deviate Nitro Elite 3 made up nearly 40% of all responses. No surprise here since Puma is an official sponsor of Hyrox. Right next to Puma was Nike with an assortment of favourite models including the Vaporfly 4, Pegasus 41 and others. Rounding out the group was Asics, New Balance, On, and Saucony.\n\nWhen we asked members specifically about their choice of race-day shoe, here\u2019s what they had to say:\n\n\u201cGrip and traction made a huge difference on the sled.\u201d says Resilience Member @shellyversoza about her Puma Deviate Nitro 3\u2019s.\n\n\u201cCushion for the runs, control for sled work.\u201d says Resilience Coach @nikkipfit, about the On Cloudmonster\u2019s she wore at Toronto 2024.\n\n### Key Takeways\n\nWhile the two PUMA models were by far the most popular picks, it\u2019s worth noting that PUMA is the official HYROX sponsor, which gives them an edge in visibility and trust. Ultimately, choice of shoe is going to come down to a little bit of trial and error to find the fit and brand that works best for you.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at another key detail that can make or break your race: socks.\n\n## Best HYROX Socks 2025\n\nGetting a blister at the 3rd station can make your next 5 stations a living hell. Translation\u2026 Socks matter (well to most anyway).\n\nWhen we asked our members what mattered most when it comes to a race-day sock, the answers were clear: breathability first, compression second, and just enough padding to take the sting out of pavement.\n\nWhile a several members said that \u201cwhatever\u2019s clean\u201d was good enough, our Head Coach Andrew Gillis noted that for some racers, socks are a much talked about and debated topic in HYROX and Hybrid fitness circles. When we asked our survey respondents what brands they most preferred, Nike as the clear winner, while more niche brands like Feetures were also considered.\n\nWhile a number of our respondents opted for \u201cwhatever\u2019s clean,\u201d and \u201cany sock is fine\u201d, our Head Coach Andrew Gillis noted that for some, socks are a much talked about and debated topic in HYROX and Hybrid fitness circles. When we asked our survey respondents what brands they most preferred, Nike as the clear winner, while more niche brands like Feetures were also considered.\n\n\u201cPadding without swamp\u2011foot\u201d says @jonfrancomonaco about his Feetures Elite Max Cushion\n\n\u201cBreathability\u201d says @jclistro7 is the reason she prefers Lululemon socks for race-day\n\n### Key Takeways\n\nSo there you have it. For some folks, socks are a non issue, while for others, the right sock is an important part of their race-day gear.\n\nNext up: We\u2019ll take a look at the most important qualities our respondents noted for their race-day apparel and the brands they most loved.\n\nFind out why stretchy, sweat-wicking fabrics are winning the race.\n\n## Best HYROX Apparel 2025\n\nIf you could design the perfect race-day apparel, what would you include? When we asked our members, sweat-wicking, breathable fabrics were at the top of the feature list.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the only feature our respondents felt were important. In nearly all cases, our respondents showed a strong preference for anti-chafe and seamless designs, with storage space for gels, and a stretchy material.\n\nIdeally, our participants felt that the perfect race-day apparel is one that works with you, doesn\u2019t bunch up, or slip down, while keeping you cool, dry and focused on your race, not your clothes.\n\nAs shown in the survey data, in addition to the breathable, sweat-wicking fabric, our athletes also stressed the importance of apparel with cargo space for energy gels that also looked good in photos. When we asked which brands had the best combination of those attributes, we found a somewhat diverse range of answers. While some athletes chose generic Amazon brands, others preferred more niche brands like ASRV or Toronto\u2019s own\n\nSaya The Label. Overall, the majority of our members preferred Nike and Lululemon.\n\nWhen it came to preferred race day brands, Nike\u2019s Dri-Fit was quite popular. Leading the group was Lululemon, which as noted is highly favoured by female racers. Some of the other brands our athletes liked were Gymshark, Puma and Under Armour getting honourable mentions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve stuck with Lululemon for both my races because how thin and agile the material is. The last thing I want to be concerned about it my shorts rising up anything falling/sliding down. It\u2019s been my tried and true. I\u2019ve heard great things about LSKD and ONER Active for women.\u201d says Resilience Member Sarah Jai\n\n\u201cThe fit is just perfect.\u201d \u2013 says Resilience Coach and Hyrox Toronto 2024 racer @elleithium about Under Armour\n\n### Key Takeways\n\nThe overwhelming favorite among athletes was Lululemon, praised for its movement-friendly cuts and breathable fabrics. Nike Dri-FIT came in strong as well, with many citing its ability to wick away sweat and stay dry across stations. Toronto-based Saya also made an impression with its functional-yet-flattering designs. Ultimately, athletes chose apparel that blends performance with comfort\u2014gear that won\u2019t ride up, chafe, or hold them back when it counts.\n\n## Best HYROX Tech & Trackers 2025\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of numbers in HYROX. From lap splits and heart rate zones to cumulative time on each station, today\u2019s athletes aren\u2019t just training hard\u2014they\u2019re training smart. And that means tracking everything.\n\nBut there\u2019s a nuance here: for many, the Apple Watch is their\n\n*everyday* watch\u2014not their go-to for HYROX prep. Some athletes have picked up a second device specifically for training and race-day. Why? For more accurate interval data, better recovery insights, and tools designed for performance\u2014not just convenience.\n\nHere\u2019s what our respondents are using to track their progress:\n\n",

          "snippet": "When preparing for your first HYROX, there\u2019s a lot of things to consider; you\u2019ve got the training, the tactics, the nutrition, and more. But one major question that regularly comes up is \u201c\n\n**what footwear should you wear for a HYROX race\u201d**?\n\nYou see, HYROX isn\u2019t\n\n*just* a running event; there\u2019s a range of functional exercises required too which means the typical question in competitor\u2019s minds is whether running shoes are best, or is it more of a CrossFit event (and so are CrossFit style shoes more appropriate)? And if it\u2019s running shoes, which of the many available are best for an event like this?\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that having the right footwear is important in HYROX. 8km+ is a lot of distance to cover in the wrong trainers, not to mention having the wrong footwear on some of the stations \u2013 such as the sled push \u2013 can really mess up your race.\n\nIn this article we will look at the main considerations when choosing your footwear for competing in HYROX.\n\n**We also share the specific shoes that some of the top athletes in the sport are been wearing, plus look in depth at some of the most popular shoes in the sport right now.**\n\nLet\u2019s dive in\u2026\n\n__Comfort __\n\n__Comfort__\n\nWe\u2019ll start with something that\u2019s probably goes without saying, but is also the most important; you want something that you feel comfortable in. If a shoe meets all the other criteria mentioned below, but doesn\u2019t feel comfortable to you, then it\u2019s the wrong choice. Furthermore, it should be something that you\u2019ll feel comfortable wearing whilst running for over 8km.\n\nFor this reason, I think CrossFit shoes \u2013 like the Puma Fuse or Nike Metcon\u2019s \u2013 aren\u2019t appropriate for HYROX. Whilst they are comfortable in general, have good grip, and would be great for the functional exercises, they just wouldn\u2019t be comfortable enough for 8km+ of running, or perform as well as other trainers might. Running shoes are far more appropriate.\n\nSome running shoes will be more rigid than others, some lighter in weight, some bouncier, and so on. Differing shoes have differing heel drop (which is the difference between the height of the heel and the height of the forefoot).\n\nThose factors all come down to personal preference, so I won\u2019t give too much specific direction on them here in relation to HYROX. I will say though, in general, the less weight the better (but don\u2019t overthink it as a few extra grams won\u2019t make much difference to your time) and people who run with their heel striking the ground first may benefit from a slightly higher heel drop (perhaps 5-10mm).\n\nSimplistically speaking, if you\u2019d be happy to run 5-10km in them, that\u2019s a good starting point.\n\n__Grip__\n\n__Grip__\n\nThe shoe you wear for HYROX will need a sufficient amount of grip. This is primarily for the sled pull and sled push exercises, but can also be important for slippery areas on the floor (especially in places where water has been spilt).\n\nIf you have a lack of grip on your footwear when pushing or pulling the sleds, your feet can slip on the carpet, thereby making something very hard, much harder. This is certainly something that has caught out many HYROX competitors in past events.\n\nThe grip of your trainer is primarily impacted by the amount and texture of the rubber on the outsole. The outsole is the underside of the shoe, at the front end, from the mid foot up to under the toes. It is the part that will have the most contact with the carpet on the sled push. You don\u2019t want the outsole to be completely smooth \u2013 some ridges (lugs) will help to add to the grip. As an example, here\u2019s the underside of the popular\n\n**Puma Deviate Nitro 3 Elite** which have a good amount of grip and feel very solid on the sleds\u2026\n\nIn my experience it\u2019s not something to stress over a huge amount if the lug height isn\u2019t huge but you likely do need something!\n\nIt\u2019s worth adding that its not just lug size that affects the grip \u2013 the\n\n*type* of rubber does too. For example, Puma often talk about their \u201cPUMAGRIP\u201d which is their proprietary rubber outsole technology \u201cfor multi surface traction\u201d.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t sure if your shoe has enough grip, the best thing to do would be to test it out on a sled push prior to the event.\n\n*Tip \u2013 if you haven\u2019t entered a HYROX before, when testing the shoes on a sled push, make it heavier than you\u2019re expecting it to be.*\n\n*Super Shoes*\n\nA lot of the more expensive racing \u201csuper shoes\u201d being brought to the market are great for running but\n\n*may* not be appropriate for HYROX. One of the reasons for this is the lack of grip many of them provide. Often they are simply designed for running long distances in. Therefore, the companies minimise the amount the shoe weighs by sacrificing rubber on the outsole. It\u2019s certainly something to check out before making an expensive purchase.\n\n__Heel Counter__\n\n__Heel Counter__\n\nThe heel counter is at the heel of the shoe and helps to provide stability to the back of the foot. It can be an important consideration for HYROX as if the shoe you\u2019re using doesn\u2019t have a solid heel counter, which fits snugly and securely around your foot, your feet could slip out of the trainer when pushing the sled (even if it feels fine when running).\n\nAgain, this is something to preferably be testing out in training (or in the warmup area at HYROX, providing you have a backup pair of shoes with you!). If you do find you have an issue, then tightening your laces can help, and / or using \u201cheel lock lacing\u201d\u2026\n\n*Heel Lock Lacing*\n\nHeel lock lacing can help to prevent your feet slipping out of the shoe. How to do this is explained well in this video\u2026\n\n**St**\n\n**ack** Height\n\n**ack**Height\n\nFinally, we should discuss the stack height of the shoe. This refers to the amount of foam on the bottom of the trainer, essentially separating your foot from the ground. The more height / foam a shoe has normally makes it feel bouncier, and more comfortable over long distance runs.\n\nAn example of shoes with a high stack height are the Nike Vaporfly (40mm) and Nike Alphafly (39mm). World Athletics have said the max stack height for road racing is 40mm (which is why a lot of companies \u2013 like Nike \u2013 are bringing their road running shoes close to that maximum). However, a stack height this high isn\u2019t always ideal for HYROX as they can sometimes feel as if they lack stability. Stability is rarely a problem for a basic road race where there aren\u2019t too many tight twists and turns. But in HYROX there are plenty of corners to get round when running the laps. You\u2019d also potentially lose vital seconds getting your foot under the straps when getting on to the rower. This is another one of those areas that come down to personal preference.\n\nI\u2019ve used the Puma Deviate Nitro (more on that below) which have a 36mm stack height, and that didn\u2019t cause me any stability problems. I have also used the Mizuno Wave Rebellion Pro which has a 40mm stack height. That definitely doesn\u2019t feel as stable as some shoes but it is a compromise that some athletes (including Elites) are willing to make because they feel good for the running. So this topic can come down to personal preference.\n\n__What Shoes are the Top HYROX Athletes Wearing?__\n\n__What Shoes are the Top HYROX Athletes Wearing?__\n\nI questioned a few of the top HYROX performers on what they wear for a race. Remember though \u2013 just because that\u2019s what they wear, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right for you, especially from a comfort perspective. Here\u2019s what they told me\u2026\n\nLinda Meier (2025 World Champion) \u2013 Puma Deviate Nitro 3 Elite\n\nTim Wenisch (2025 World Champion) \u2013 Adidas (prototype shoe)\n\nHunter McIntyre \u2013 Puma Deviate Nitro 3\n\nJoanna Wietrzyk \u2013 Puma Deviate Nitro 3\n\nMegan Jacoby \u2013 Puma Deviate Nitro 3 Elite\n\nLauren Weeks \u2013 Mizuno Wave Rebellion Pro\n\nJames Kelly \u2013 Puma Deviate Nitro 2 Elite\n\nKate Davey \u2013 Saucony Endorphin Pro\n\nMikaela Norman \u2013 Puma Deviate Nitro 3 Elite\n\nAlexander Roncevic \u2013 ON Cloudboom Echo 3\n\nPaul Gillingham \u2013 Puma Velocity Nitro\n\nVivian Tafuto \u2013 Saucony Endorphin Pro\n\nJon Wynn \u2013 Saucony Endorphin Pro\n\nDylan Scott \u2013 Mizuno Wave Rebellion Pro\n\nRich Ryan \u2013 Mizuno Wave Rebellion Pro\n\nGreg Williams (that\u2019s me, I figure if I call myself a \u201ctop athlete\u201d often enough I\u2019ll eventually become one!) \u2013 Puma Deviate Nitro 3 Elite or Mizuno Wave Rebellion Pro or Saucony Endorphin Pro (yes I can be indecisive!). I also use the Puma Velocity Nitro regularly in my training sessions (you can read a full review of the Puma Velocity 3 here).\n\n__Popular HYROX Footwear__\n\n__Popular HYROX Footwear__\n\nBelow we\u2019ve put together some in-depth reviews of some of the most popular HYROX footwear right now\u2026\n\n**Puma Deviate Nitro 3 Elite**\n\nThe Puma Deviate Nitro Elite 3 is a popular choice in HYROX and regularly features in conversations about the best shoes for HYROX racing. Puma are a sponsor of the sport and even offer a HYROX-branded version of this model. Beyond the branding, its design \u2013 combining race-ready running performance with excellent grip for indoor racing surfaces \u2013 makes it a natural fit for the demands of HYROX.\n\nIt delivers a responsive, race-ready feel that excels in the running segments, with the updated NITROFOAM\u2122 ELITE providing a snappy, propulsive ride without feeling overly harsh. The PUMAGRIP outsole offers excellent traction, making it particularly effective for the sled push and pull. The trade-off is a relatively narrow platform and high stack height, which can feel less stable under heavy lateral forces compared to flatter trainers \u2013 though in HYROX, this is rarely a limiting factor. For walking lunges and burpee broad jumps, the lightweight build and rocker shape give strong forward drive, though the higher stack can make them feel a touch less planted than lower-profile trainers.\n\nIt\u2019s a shoe best suited to athletes who prioritise running speed in HYROX while still needing reliable grip for functional stations.\n\n**Saucony Endorphin Pro 4**\n\nAnother popular choice is the Saucony Endorphin Pro 4, a top-tier carbon-plated racing shoe for HYROX athletes wanting strong running speed without sacrificing too much stability or grip in the stations.\n\nIts PWRRUN HG foam, paired with a full-length carbon plate, delivers a propulsive ride and smooth roll thanks to Saucony\u2019s SPEEDROLL geometry. Grip is solid for the sled push and pull, while the broader forefoot platform offers a touch more stability than many super shoes. Durability is decent for a race shoe, with reinforced outsole rubber improving lifespan compared to earlier models, though it doesn\u2019t feel quite as cushioned as the Endorphin Pro 3 \u2013 a model that was extremely popular among early adopters in the sport.\n\n**Mizuno Rebellion Pro Wave 3**\n\nThe Mizuno Wave Rebellion Pro 3 is perhaps an unconventional choice for HYROX, yet it\u2019s extremely popular with some athletes \u2013 including many at the very top of the sport. Its extreme rocker geometry and aggressive heel bevel are designed to promote rapid turnover and forward momentum, making it particularly fast in the run segments, and the grip is better than many expect.\n\nThe main trade-off is stability \u2013 the high 40 mm stack height can make stations like lunges and wall balls, or courses with heavy cornering, feel less secure. Still, for athletes chasing maximum running efficiency, it\u2019s a compromise many are willing to make. Just a word of caution though \u2013 they wont suit all running styles. If you are more of a heel striker you likely won\u2019t get as much benefit from the shoe as a forefoot striker might.\n\n**HYROX Specific Shoe from Puma (coming soon)**\n\nAhead of HYROX Melbourne, PUMA revealed the hotly anticipated Deviate NITRO\u2122 Elite HYROX \u2013 the first shoe built specifically for HYROX competition.\n\nThe shoe (which was worn by many of the Elite 15 athletes in Melbourne) features a full-coverage, high traction PUMAGRIP outsole that has a specially engineered lug pattern for added grip and traction. The reengineered NITROFOAM\u2122 Elite has been adapted to provide elite-level cushioning for maximum energy return.\n\nSitting flush between the NITROFOAM\u2122 Elite is a full-length, newly curated carbon fibre PWRPLATE that provides increased propulsion and support, whilst a premium, feather-light ULTRAWEAVE upper wraps the foot for breathability and secure lockdown, powering athletes through runs, reps and everything in between.\n\nThe Deviate NITRO\u2122 Elite HYROX will launch on 19 February, available to purchase on PUMA.com, in PUMA Flagship stores, at HYROX events, on HYROX World, and in selected retailers across North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Australia.\n\nI (Greg) was commentating for HYROX on the elite races in Melbourne and can confirm that these shoes feel great and its clear they have been designed for the sport. Great cushioning, stability, grip \u2013 once released to the general public, they are sure to be hugely popular within the HYROX community.\n\n__Summary__\n\n__Summary__\n\nHaving written this article I will sum it up by saying that the right footwear for HYROX is important but try not to overthink it too much. If you have a pair of shoes that will be comfortable to run in for 8km+, have some grip on the bottom, tie your laces well, and have a stack height that feels good to you and your preferences, you\u2019ll likely be fine. To be sure, try and test them out on a heavy sled push and sled pull, in particular, beforehand.\n\nYou can see from the above list of some of the sports top performers that there isn\u2019t an obvious choice of footwear out there \u2013 there is a variety \u2013 and that\u2019s because personal preference is so important.\n\nIn addition to this article, I\u2019ve also recorded a video discussing the best footwear for HYROX over on YouTube \u2013 just click the link to view it.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s worth saying, doing well at HYROX is about more than just picking the right footwear. There\u2019s the small matter of training for example!

          "snippet": "**Summary**\n\nThis definitive Hyrox equipment guide equips athletes to conquer every station\u2014from selecting running shoes that balance 8 km speed with sled-push stability, to mastering sled technique, grip-saving chalk strategies, and kettlebell/dumbbell workouts that mirror race-day movements. Readers learn how the right heel stack, energy-return midsoles, and 60 %+ energy-return foams shave minutes off total time, why burpee-broad-jump mats and sweat-proof hand protection prevent 3\u20135 % time drains, and how resistance-band mobility rituals and progressive dumbbell snatches, deadlifts, and farmer\u2019s carries build the specific strength that powers SkiErg pulls, wall-ball squats, and heavy sled pushes and pulls. The article unpacks wall-ball specs (6\u20139 kg, 9\u201310 ft targets, 75\u2013100 reps), hydration science (300\u20131 000 mg sodium/liter to counter 1\u20131.5 L sweat loss), and timing-chip logistics, then delivers a champion\u2019s packing checklist\u2014shoes, bib, ankle chip, soft-flask electrolytes, anti-chafe, recovery clothes\u2014so nothing is left to chance. By turning gear choices into measurable performance gains, the piece shows why meticulous equipment prep is the easiest way to turn training devotion into a new personal best on race day.\n\n## Building Your Hyrox Equipment List: Core Gear Essentials\n\nPick a 7\u201310 oz shoe with textured rubber lugs, a 30\u201338 mm stable heel and 60 %+ energy-return foam to keep your footing on sleds and your speed between stations.\n\n### Running shoes for Hyrox performance\n\nChoosing the right running shoes for Hyrox can significantly impact your race day performance - and we're here to help you nail it! Unlike traditional running events, Hyrox combines 8 kilometers of running with functional fitness stations, requiring footwear that balances running efficiency with stability for workout stations\n\n. Your ideal shoe needs superior grip for those challenging sled pushes and pulls where feet commonly slip on carpeted surfaces. Look for shoes with textured rubber outsoles featuring moderate lugs\u2014completely smooth outsoles will compromise your power transfer during sled work, making an already tough station even harder . Quality rubber compounds can provide approximately 42. 6% better traction than average running shoes, giving you the edge when it matters most . Here's the truth: stability matters as much as speed when you're devoted to crushing your Hyrox goals. While high-stack carbon-plated racing shoes excel for pure running, they often lack the stability you need for functional exercises.\n\nYou'll want shoes with a moderate stack height (30-38mm heel stack) that provides cushioning without disconnecting you from the ground\n\n. A wider base and firmer midsole (at least 15 HA firmness rating) will keep you rock-solid during weighted exercises\u2014because wobbling wastes energy you can't afford to lose . Energy return is your secret weapon for maintaining speed between stations. When you're pushing through those kilometer segments, shoes with responsive midsole foams deliver higher energy return percentages (aim for 60%+), literally giving back the energy you put in . Some modern running shoes achieve impressive forefoot energy return rates of 78. 2%, making them particularly effective for maintaining pace when fatigue starts creeping in . Every gram counts when you're devoted to peak performance. Top-performing Hyrox shoes typically weigh 15-23% less than average running shoes, with some models coming in at just 7.\n\n2 oz (204g)\u2014that's the difference between feeling fresh and feeling fatigued during those final stations\n\n. Elite Hyrox athletes consistently choose lightweight options that don't sacrifice functional performance, because they know that smart equipment choices lead to stronger finishes . Don't forget about flexibility\u2014your feet need to move naturally through lunges and burpees! Overly rigid shoes (particularly those with carbon plates) can seriously hinder these movements despite helping with running speed . Look for options that offer at least 40% more flexibility than average running shoes, making your transitions between stations smooth and efficient . Remember, the strongest athletes move with purpose at every station.\n\n### Weighted sled and sled push/pull basics\n\nThe sled push and pull stations will test everything you've got\u2014but with the right approach, you'll conquer them! During competition, you'll navigate a 50-meter course\u2014divided into four 12. 5-meter sections\u2014with a weighted sled that varies by division\n\n. This is where the devoted separate themselves from the rest. For the sled push, women in Open division handle 102 kg, while Pro women manage 152 kg. Men push significantly heavier loads: 152 kg for Open and 202 kg for Pro categories .\n\nThese weights include both the sled itself (typically 30-40 kg) plus the added plates\n\n. Here's what many athletes don't expect: the surface is your hidden opponent. Hyrox events use carpeting that's often sticky and uneven, creating additional resistance that doesn't exist during your typical gym training . This surface tends to bunch and wrinkle during use, making proper technique absolutely crucial for maintaining momentum. The good news? Most competitors find that smart technique and solid traction matter more than raw strength\u2014it's about working with your body, not just powering through .\n\nYour body positioning can make or break your sled performance\u2014let's get it right! Stand strong with feet hip-width apart, hands firmly gripping the handles, and your body tilted forward in a straight line from head to heels\n\n. That initial push needs to be powerful and confident to overcome inertia, then shift to shorter, faster steps to keep that momentum going. Stay devoted to proper form by avoiding these energy-draining mistakes: fully extending your arms (hello, shoulder strain! ), stopping mid-course (restarting is brutal), and forgetting to engage your core throughout the movement . The sled pull uses the same equipment but with slightly reduced weights, testing different muscle groups as you pull the sled using arm and back strength over the same distance .\n\n### Burpee broad jump mat and grip aids\n\nThe burpee broad jump station is where mental toughness meets explosive power\u2014and having the right gear gives you the confidence to push through! This station demands proper equipment for both your hands and feet, as fatigue will test every aspect of your preparation.\n\nWhile specific grip requirements depend on your hand conditioning, many devoted athletes choose minimalist options that provide protection without sacrificing the tactile feedback you need during transitions. Your footwear plays an equally crucial role during burpee broad jumps\u2014look for shoes that offer rock-solid stability for landings while maintaining the flexibility needed for explosive takeoffs\n\n\n\nRemember, equipment failures don't just slow you down physically; they mess with your head and compound across the remaining stations. Smart gear selection isn't optional\u2014it's what separates those who finish strong from those who just finish.\n\n## Strength Tools That Make the Difference on Race Day\n\nMaster the 200-meter Farmer Carry\u201416-24kg per hand after 6km of fatigue\u2014by training grip-specific endurance post-cardio and using the station as strategic active recovery to protect that crucial 3-5% of race time.\n\n### Kettlebells and dumbbells for functional lifts\n\nHere's where your strength truly gets tested. The Farmer Carry station challenges you to transport serious weight over 200 meters\u2014and it comes at you after 6km of running and five grueling exercises\n\n. You'll be carrying 16kg per hand if you're a woman, 24kg if you're a man, with Pro divisions stepping up to 24kg and 32kg respectively . This isn't just about muscle power\u2014it's about mental toughness when fatigue is already setting in. What makes this station special? It's actually a chance to partially recover your cardiovascular system while your grip, shoulders, and core take the heat . Smart competitors use this to their advantage, treating it as active recovery that still demands respect.\n\nMany athletes discover their grip gives out before their strength does\u2014and poor grip preparation can cost you 3-5% of your total race time\n\n. That's the difference between crushing your goals and watching them slip away. Your training approach matters. Mix it up with heavier weights for short bursts (20 yards) to build raw strength, then lighter loads for longer carries (100+ yards) to develop that crucial endurance . Want to truly prepare? Practice your Farmer Carries after cardio work\u2014just like race day conditions. Keep your posture tall and proud with shoulders back, core locked in, and hands gripping centrally on the implements .\n\nWatch out for the energy-draining mistakes: letting your head drop forward, rounding your back, or shifting weight unevenly\n\n. For those devoted to getting stronger, having quality [equipment](https://shop. centr. com) that matches competition standards makes all the difference. Train with the same weights you'll face on race day, and your body\u2014and mind\u2014will thank you when it counts.\n\n### Resistance bands for mobility and activation\n\nDon't underestimate the power of resistance bands\u2014they're your secret weapon for unlocking performance most competitors leave on the table. While others focus only on strength and endurance, smart athletes know that mobility and activation separate good from great on race day. Your warm-up transforms when you add bands to the mix. Shoulder dislocations with bands wake up those crucial rotator cuff muscles and scapular stabilizers you'll need for ski erg, wall balls, and rowing\n\n. Skip this, and you risk wasting energy through compensation patterns during your 8km run and 8 workout stations.\n\nFor your ankles\u2014the foundation of efficient running and sled work\u2014bands provide the perfect progressive resistance for dorsiflexion drills, fixing those limitations that otherwise lead to knee problems or hip compensation\n\n. Here's what should motivate you: research shows 73% of Hyrox athletes have limited hip mobility, directly impacting their performance and recovery . That's a massive opportunity for you to gain an edge. Use banded hip activation to prepare those powerhouse muscles for everything from sled pushes to lunges. Add thoracic mobility work with bands for the controlled rotation and extension you need to maintain strong posture during wall balls and rowing.\n\nElite competitors know the drill\u2014they use bands during their 7-8 minute movement quality warm-up phase, grooving perfect joint positions before ramping up intensity\n\n. The beauty of bands? They're portable enough to use anywhere, even in packed warm-up areas where space is premium. Grab yourself a complete set with multiple resistance levels\u2014light bands for shoulder and thoracic work, medium for general activation, and heavy for serious hip and lower body prep. This small investment pays massive dividends when you're moving efficiently while others struggle with stiff joints and poor activation.\n\n### Wall balls and medicine balls for explosive power\n\nThis is it\u2014the final test that separates finishers from champions. After 8km of running and seven brutal stations, you'll face 100 wall ball throws when every fiber in your body screams to quit. Women tackle 4kg balls to 2. 70m (Pro women use 6kg), while men throw 6kg to 3m targets (Pro men handle 9kg to the same height)\n\n. This is where mental strength meets physical endurance. Quality equipment becomes your best friend when fatigue peaks. Competition-grade wall balls feature double-stitched PVC shells that keep their shape and maintain grip even when your hands are drenched in sweat .\n\nHere's the harsh truth: failed reps don't count. Zero. Nothing. A slippery medicine ball or poor equipment choice can turn your final push into an endless nightmare, draining precious energy and destroying your finishing time\n\n. Forget brute strength\u2014this station rewards smart strategy and rhythm. Elite athletes break those 100 reps into calculated segments (think 10-25 rep sets) with brief, strategic rests. They know that attempting to go unbroken usually leads to total form collapse .\n\nMaster these four non-negotiables for success: sink into a full-depth squat every time (no-reps will crush your soul), catch with bent arms to maintain momentum, keep your eyes locked on that target, and breathe with purpose\u2014inhale on the squat, exhale on the explosive throw\n\n. Don't let equipment failures sabotage your finish. Train with balls that match competition specs, not lighter versions that give false confidence. Choose medicine balls with the right diameter for your hands, and make sure they maintain grip when wet\u2014because you will be drenched . This final station isn't just about surviving\u2014it's about finishing strong and proving you're devoted to excellence when it matters most.\n\n## Practical Gear for Efficiency and Safety\n\nHydrate like it's your secret weapon\u2014start 24 hours early with electrolyte-loaded sips, carry it in a sleek pack that won\u2019t slow you down, and slam 150% of what you lost within four hours of finishing so your power and mind stay razor-sharp when others crash.\n\n### Hydration packs and electrolyte strategy\n\nLet's talk about something that could make or break your HYROX performance\u2014proper hydration. You've trained hard, you're strong, and you're ready to crush it. But here's the truth: even the strongest athletes can falter without smart hydration. Your body will work incredibly hard during HYROX, losing 1-1. 5 liters of fluid every hour\n\n. That might sound like just numbers, but here's what it means for you: losing just 2% of your body weight through sweat can slash your endurance and power by 10-15% . Most athletes walk away from HYROX having lost 2-3% of their bodyweight\u2014enough to seriously impact both your strength and mental sharpness . But you're not going to be \"most athletes. \" You're going to be prepared.\n\nStart your hydration game plan 24 hours before race day. This isn't about chugging water the morning of\u2014it's about consistently hydrating until your urine is pale yellow by start time\n\n. Think of it as loading your muscles with the fuel they need to perform. During the race, you won't have time for leisurely water breaks. Plan strategic sips during station transitions using a hydration pack or soft flask. Here's your winning formula: electrolyte solution with 300-1000mg sodium per liter, tailored to your personal sweat rate . Water alone won't cut it\u2014the intense combination of running and functional stations demands proper electrolyte balance to keep cramping and fatigue at bay . For carrying your hydration, keep it simple. Choose minimalist hydration packs that won't interfere with your movements, or grab easily accessible soft flasks that tuck into shorts pockets between stations .\n\nThe key is having your hydration strategy support your performance, not slow you down. After you cross that finish line, the work isn't quite done. Replace 150% of the fluid you lost over the next 2-4 hours\u2014if you dropped 1kg during the race, drink 1. 5 liters of electrolyte-enhanced fluid\n\n. This recovery hydration is what separates those who bounce back strong from those who feel wiped out for days. Here's the golden rule: test everything during your training. Never experiment on race day. Indoor HYROX venues can surprise you with limited airflow and higher sweat rates than your outdoor training sessions . Know your body, practice your strategy, and show up ready to dominate.\n\n### Compression wear and injury prevention gear\n\nUnable to write content for 'Compression wear and injury prevention gear' as no source texts were provided within the tags.\n\nAs instructed, content must be written using ONLY the provided source texts with proper citations.\n\n## Preparing and Packing Your Hyrox Equipment List\n\nLay out every battle-tested item\u2014from fuel-packed gels to backup socks\u2014the night before so race morning feels like a confident march to the start line, not a frantic scavenger hunt.\n\n### Checklist: what to pack the night before\n\nYou've trained hard, and now it's time to set yourself up for success. Creating your race-day ritual starts the night before\u2014this is where champions separate themselves from the crowd. Find a dedicated space and lay out your equipment like a warrior preparing for battle\n\n. Your race-day arsenal should include those energy gels or fuel packets you've battle-tested during training\u2014competition day is about execution, not experimentation .\n\nAs covered in our footwear section, those trusted shoes you've conquered multiple workouts in belong front and center. Pack your secret weapons: mobility tools like a lacrosse ball and foam roller that'll keep you moving fluidly from warm-up through recovery\n\n. Your backpack becomes your mobile command center with essentials like a complete change of clothes (yes, extra socks are non-negotiable), flip-flops for post-victory comfort, body wipes, protein fuel, phone charger, and a victory bag for sweaty gear . For hydration strategy (detailed in our electrolyte section), have your preferred mix ready to go.\n\nPlan your pre-race fuel based on heat timing: morning warriors need that light meal 2-3 hours before, while afternoon competitors should map out both breakfast and lunch strategies\n\n. The pros know: double-check that HYROX confirmation, charge all devices, and separate race gear from travel clothes . Veterans even stash backup socks\u2014because wet feet during prep can derail your mindset . This systematic approach transforms race morning from potentially chaotic to confidently controlled, setting the stage for your strongest performance yet .\n\n### Mental readiness: gear as a confidence boost\n\nI cannot write content for the 'Mental readiness: gear as a confidence boost' section as no source texts were provided within the tags.\n\nAs instructed, content must be written using ONLY the provided source texts with proper citations.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\nChoose running shoes with 30-38mm heel stack, >60% energy return, and grippy outsoles for 8km runs plus sled work.\n\nPoor grip or wrong mat can cost 3-5% total race time on burpee broad jumps\u2014use chalk and reliable hand protection.\n\nTrain sled push/pull with knurled-grip poles and marked hand placements; technique trumps brute strength.\n\nWall-ball weights: men 14lb@10ft (pro 20lb), women 9lb@9ft (pro 14lb); 75\u2013100 reps must break parallel.\n\nHydrate early: 2% fluid loss cuts power 10\u201315%; aim for 300\u20131000mg sodium/L via soft flasks between stations.\n\nSecure timing chip on right ankle, pin color-coded bib front, arrive 90min early for smooth check-in.\n\nPack night before: race kit, backup socks, pre-mixed electrolytes, anti-chafe, tape, and post-race recovery gear.\n\n**References**\n\n- https://runrepeat.com/guides/best-hyrox-running-shoes\n\n- https://roxlyfe.com/what-is-the-best-footwear-for-hyrox/\n\n- https://www.pace-club.com/blog/hyrox-weights\n\n- https://www.drip-hiit.com/en/sled-push-hyrox/\n\n- https://hyroxtrainingplans.com/blog/hyrox-equipment-complete-guide\n\n- https://www.thegymgroup.com/blog/hyrox-weights/\n\n- https://krakensport.com/your-ultimatte-hyrox-workout-guide/\n\n- https://www.drip-hiit.com/en/farmer-carry-hyrox/\n\n- https://roxhype.com/faq/hyrox-mobility-exercises\n\n- https://pliability.com/stories/hyrox-mobility\n\n- https://www.rmr.training/blog/master-your-hyrox-warm-up\n\n- https://www.performbetter.com/HYROX-Competition-Wall-Ball/?srsltid=AfmBOor5DAbfXIfIS8lCO3u_mUjTmhfDuH43AbFIvsZZP1Kq455GzU95\n\n- https://hyrox.rhtrainingclub.com/hyrox-station-tip/wall-balls/\n\n- https://rb100.fitness/articles/nutrition-recovery/hyrox-hydration-strategy/\n\n- https://xmiles.co.uk/blogs/news/hydration-and-electrolyte-strategy-for-hyrox-athletes\n\n- https://www.wheelhouse.academy/news-events/hyrox-race-day-essentials\n\n- https://hyroxtrainingplans.com/blog/hyrox-packing-tips-for-beginners-vs-pros\n\n",

          "snippet": "About a year and a half ago, I signed up for my first Hyrox race. Like most people new to the sport, I went straight to YouTube. I watched hours of footage, studying how elite athletes like Hunter McIntyre moved, how they paced themselves, and what gear they used. I noticed something odd. Some athletes wore gloves, but their use was inconsistent. Some would start with them on, only to rip them off a few stations later. Others would put them on for a single lift. Some wore none at all.\nThis seemed strange. A race with so much pulling, carrying, and gripping seems perfect for gloves. Your hands get sweaty. Thousands of other people have used the equipment over a race weekend. A secure grip on the sled rope, the farmer's carry handles, or the wall ball is not a small advantage. It is fundamental.\nSo I looked online for \"Hyrox gloves.\" The search results were disappointing. All I found were bulky, heavy weightlifting gloves. It immediately became clear why athletes were taking them off mid-race.\n\nA glove designed to protect your hand from a barbell is not the right tool for this sport. The padding gets in the way. They are too hot. They are not built for the endurance and variety of a Hyrox event. They solve one problem but create several others.\n\n\u2026\n\nChalk is the common solution to grip problems, but it is not a reliable one. At the 2025 World Championships in Chicago, the event ran out of chalk. When thousands of athletes compete over a single weekend, supplies can run low. If your race strategy depends on something the event provides, your strategy has a point of failure. Gloves solve that. They are part of your own kit, completely within your control.\n\n\u2026\n\nWe also noticed that most gloves cover the wrist, which is a problem for anyone who uses a fitness tracker. We created a cutaway wrist so you can still see your watch and monitor your performance. And yes, we made them look good. This is not just vanity. When your gear looks and feels right, you perform with more confidence. You can focus entirely on the race.",

          "snippet": "This brings us to a crucial element of race strategy: your hands. The debate between using traditional chalk and modern training gloves is often framed as a matter of comfort or personal preference. We argue it\u2019s a matter of mathematics.\n\nThis analysis will dissect that choice, using the one-second margin at the elite level as our guide, to show you how a simple equipment decision could unlock a massive performance advantage in your own race.\n\n\u2026\n\nLet's break down the staggering time cost of using chalk in a HYROX race. The event consists of eight workout stations interspersed with 1km runs. Many of these stations are brutally demanding on your grip, especially as fatigue sets in:\n\n\n\n1000m SkiErg: Your first test of pulling endurance.\n50m Sled Push: Less about grip, but the fatigue begins.\n\n\n\n50m Sled Pull: The first major grip challenge.\n\n\n\n80m Burpee Broad Jumps: No grip, but a huge drain on your energy.\n\n\n\n1000m Row: Another massive pulling effort.\n\n\n\n200m Farmer's Carry: A pure test of supporting grip strength.\n100m Sandbag Lunges: The awkward shape and weight taxes your entire system, including your hold.\n\n\n\n100 Wall Balls: A final test of grip and endurance as you catch and throw the ball.\n\nTo maintain a secure hold through sweat and fatigue, a chalk user will almost certainly need to reapply before most of these stations.\n\n\u2026\n\n3 stations \u00d7 7.5 seconds/station = 22.5 seconds.\n\nYou read that right. Over the course of a race, you could be spending over 20secs of your total time on the simple act of applying chalk. This isn't a minor inefficiency; it's a self-imposed 20-second penalty.\n\nFor an elite athlete like James Kelly, that 20 secs is the entire difference between his personal best and a world record. For you, it could be the difference between hitting your goal time and missing it.\n\n## **The Case for Gloves.\n\nThis is where training gloves enter the conversation, not as a comfort item, but as a piece of high-performance racing equipment.\n\nThe primary and most powerful advantage is the elimination of the 20-second chalk penalty. You put them on once at the start line and you don\u2019t think about them again. There are no chalk stops. There is no transition friction. You move from running to lifting with zero delay.\n\n\u2026\n\nUsing chalk adds another task to that list. It\u2019s a \"noisy\" process. Your brain is constantly monitoring your grip, sending alarm signals when it starts to slip, and forcing you to think about the logistics of the next chalk stop.\n\nGloves create a \"quiet\" grip. Because the surface is consistent, you remove that entire stream of worry. You free up precious mental energy to focus on the things that truly matter: executing your race strategy and pushing through the pain barrier.\n**A Smarter Strategy**\n\nThis doesn't mean you should throw out your chalk and wear gloves for every single workout, year-round.\n\nThe smartest athletes think in seasons. The choice between gloves and chalk shouldn't be a permanent one, but a tactical decision that changes with your training goals.\n\n\n\n**Off-Season / General Prep Phase:**This is the time to build raw, foundational strength. Here, training with chalk or even bare-handed is highly beneficial. You expose your hands to the full stress of the load, forcing them to adapt and building the strongest possible unassisted grip.\n**Pre-Competition / Peaking Phase:**As you get closer to race day, your focus shifts from building strength tonoptimizing performance. In this phase, you should switch to consistently training with the lightweight, performance-oriented gloves you plan to wear on race day. This allows your nervous system to adapt to the feel and ensures you arrive at the starting line healthy and ready.\n**Choosing the Right Gloves for HYROX**\n\nWhen selecting gloves for racing, less is more. Look for models that are lightweight, breathable, and have minimal padding. The goal is not to cushion your hands, but to provide a consistent, non-slip surface that doesn't add unnecessary bulk. The good news is you don\u2019t have to look far because we\u2019ve actually built the perfect gloves for Hyrox. They\u2019re the fruits of extensive research and labor.",

          "snippet": "*Sports Medicine* indicates the answer is a qualified yes. In fact, every runner tested at the University of Colorado, Boulder\u2019s \u201cLocomotion Lab\u201d\u201418 out of 18\u2014had better running economy in the Vaporflys than when they ran in two other racing shoe models (Nike Zoom Streak 6 and Adidas Adios Boost 2). This represents a rare 100 percent success rate in the world of human-effects research. The subjects included eight rearfoot strikers, and 10 midfoot/forefoot strikers, with the heel runners gaining a somewhat greater advantage.\n\n\u2026\n\n\u201cWe were surprised by the magnitude of the effect, and that we saw savings in every single subject at all three running speeds,\u201d lead author Wouter Hoogkamer said. (The runners ran at three different paces: 6:53/mile, 6:02/mile, and 5:21/ mile.) \u201cTypically, when we test a new shoe, we see that some runners save energy, but for others, the shoe doesn\u2019t fit their personal biomechanics, so they have an increased energy cost in the new shoe. I\u2019ve never seen such a robust finding as we had with the Vaporfly shoes.\u201d\nWhile some runners\u2019 running economy improved by as little as 1.59 percent and others by as much as 6.26 percent, the averages clustered tightly around 4 percent. This allowed Hoogkamer to estimate that a runner in the Vaporfly shoes might reduce the current marathon world record of 2:02:57 to 1:58:54. Of course, there are many potential differences between treadmill running and true marathon efforts.\nTo join the study, all runners had to complete multiple 5-minute repeats as fast as 5:21/mile without edging over their lactate threshold. In the report's funniest, most understated line, the authors reported, \"It was challenging to recruit 18 runners who could sustain 18 km/hour below lactate threshold and also fit the available size M10 prototypes.\u201d\n**What Explains the Study Results?**\n\nPreviously, it was thought that shoes of light weight\u2014a\n\n*sine qua non* for fast running\u2014could not be manipulated enough to produce more than a 1 or 2 percent improvement. The Vaporflys use a new lightweight foam (ZoomX, in Nike-speak) that is both soft (cushiony) and bouncy (with high energy return.) The technical terms are \"compliant\" and \"resilient.\" The shoes also include a stiff carbon-fiber plate in the midsole to enhance ankle and foot-toe efficiency.\n\n\u2026\n\nIn their paper, the researchers try to tease out the various factors leading to the substantial energy savings. The Vaporfly wins big on cushioning: It \u201cdeforms\u201d twice as much as the other two shoes. That is, its pillowy cushioning allows the foot to sink downward twice as far as the other two midsoles.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe new Nike foam also tested best for energy return. It returned 87 percent of the stored energy, compared to 75.9 percent for the Adidas model and 65.5 percent for the other Nike shoe. The researchers believe that the combination of great cushioning and energy-return explains 80 percent of the Vaporfly\u2019s advantage.\nBut how does the greater running economy present itself? Surely, there must be a clear and simple biomechanical change that can be observed. Not so far. In the Vaporflys, the runners ran with slightly longer strides (lower stride frequency), slightly more contact time, and slightly greater peak vertical force. None of these changes were large enough to explain a 4 percent improvement in running economy.\n\n\u2026\n\nStudy author Rodger Kram and others have previously noted that softer midsoles (or treadmill surfaces) produce energy savings by allowing the knee to bend less. With less knee bending, the big quadriceps muscles are contracted less, and therefore less oxygen is consumed. However, the new study did not measure knee flex, so the researchers can\u2019t identify that as a crucial factor. \u201cWe are currently performing follow-up experiments to get more insights into the exact biomechanical mechanisms at play,\u201d Kram said.\nMidpack marathoners will wonder if the Vaporflys would work for them at, say, 4-hour marathon pace and slower. Hoogkamer believes so. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any actual data relating to 9:10 [per mile] pace,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we noted a relatively consistent 4 percent savings at the three paces we tested. So it seems we could extrapolate this to the 9:10 pace. Those runners should see an improvement of 8.4 to 8.9 minutes [in a marathon].\u201d",

It's one less\n{ts:159} thing to worry about, which is great in a high rocks race. The proof is in the performance as well. Look, gloves aren't\n\n\u2026\n\n{ts:230} the Hierrock World Championships in Chicago. I don't see the need for chalk anymore. I genuinely think that the\n{ts:235} biggest fear for people for wearing gloves is that their hands would be too hot during a Hy Rocks race. We designed\n{ts:241} the most lightweight Hy Rock gloves.",

Slow runners may benefit more from the 4% shoes than faster runners.\n\n- Footwear in general, and the tradeoff between cushioning (which is good for running economy) and weight (which is bad for running economy).\n\n- The impact of drafting in running - how much energy it can save you?\n\n\u2026\n\n- When we started testing people, we saw very clear trends.\n\nAll 18 runners reduced their energy uptake when running in the prototype shoe, and on average over all 3 velocities it was by 4%.\n\n- There was some variability - some people improved by 2% while others improved by 6% but everyone had a benefit.\n\n- We thought about the variance a lot. Hypothesisng at first we thought maybe heavier runners may have more benefit from the new foam, but this wasn't the case.\n\n\u2026\n\nIt was 4.0% better than the Adidas shoe, and 4.1% better than the Nike shoe.\n\n- We wanted to see that any effect we saw was due to the shoe properties, not just because they were lighter, so both Nike shoes had a small amount of mass added.\n\n- So it was compared to the two fastest marathon shoes out there, but this is compounded by the fact Adidas and Nike sponsor the fastest marathon runners, so their shoes are more likely to run the fastest times.\n\n- We're still trying to figure out exactly what the 4% energy expenditure saving means in terms of speed increase.\nWe do know that it's not a 1:1 relationship.\n\n- We typically measure running performance and energy cost is the classic 'if you go faster you use more energy' -but it doesn't mean if you go 4% faster you use 4% more energy.\n\nThey are not linearly related.\n\n- More recently we did an overview of the literature of different studies which measured how energy costs increases with velocity.\n\n\u2026\n\nAt that time they did see that the metabolic savings were around 6% of energy cost, which was independent of running economy.\n\nThis indicates that whether you're running at a 2-hour pace, or a 4-hour pace, you will get a 6% benefit in energy cost from running 1m behind another runner.",

          "snippet": "**Summary**\n\nCompression gear is the unsung force multiplier for Hyrox Phoenix athletes, turning eight brutal kilometers of run-strength transitions into a controlled, power-preserving march to the finish. By wrapping calves, quads, shoulders and trunk in 20-30 mmHg of graduated squeeze, the right tights, tops and sleeves slash micro-vibration, flush lactic acid and heighten proprioception so you keep an efficient stride, stable joints and explosive technique long after unsupported rivals fade.\nThe article maps out exactly how that compression boosts circulation between stations, locks in biomechanics during sled pushes and wall balls, and speeds recovery within the race\u2019s relentless interval format, then walks you through fabric tech, fit protocols, warm-up integration and low-heat laundry habits that keep the squeeze (and the performance dividends) alive for 70-100 hard training sessions.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Why hyrox phoenix compression gear Boosts Race Performance\n\nHyrox Phoenix compression gear's graduated pressure stabilizes your calves, slashes micro-vibration and fatigue, and keeps oxygen-rich blood flowing so you can hammer all eight 1 km segments while rivals fade.\n\n\u2026\n\n. This is where compression gear becomes your secret weapon\u2014providing targeted muscle stabilization by reducing those energy-draining micro-vibrations that occur with each footfall . Here's the game-changer: compression wear applies graduated pressure\u2014tighter at the ankle and gradually decreasing up the calf\u2014to supercharge your blood circulation back to the heart . This enhanced circulation delivers oxygen-rich blood to working muscles while efficiently clearing out metabolic waste products that cause premature fatigue during runs . The result?\nYou maintain stride efficiency and endurance across all eight running segments, staying strong when others start to fade. But that's just the beginning. Compression gear provides structural support that limits excessive muscle movement, keeping you dialed in when it counts. The targeted pressure around your calves restricts unnecessary oscillation during impact, reducing the microtrauma that accumulates during those repeated running segments\n. This stabilizing effect becomes your best friend as fatigue sets in during later stages of the race\u2014exactly when form typically falls apart. Athletes consistently report significantly better pace maintenance and lower leg comfort during those make-or-break final kilometers of Hyrox competitions .\n\nThe stabilizing benefits extend to joint alignment too. Compression tights support proper biomechanics throughout your running stride, taking the stress off your knees and ankles\n. This becomes absolutely crucial during Hyrox's demanding format, where you're constantly transitioning between functional strength exercises and running. The support prevents those compensation patterns that emerge when muscles fatigue, protecting you from both acute injuries and overuse problems like shin splints that commonly sideline Hyrox competitors . Stay devoted to your training\u2014let compression gear handle the protection.\n\n### Power Support for Strength Stations\n\nHyrox's strength stations demand maximum power output when you're already fatigued from running segments\u2014this is where the devoted separate themselves from the rest. Compression garments provide critical stability during these high-output exercises by reducing muscle vibration and maintaining proper alignment\n\n. Picture this: during sled pushes and pulls, compression tights lock in your posterior chain and core, allowing more efficient force transfer from legs to ground . This stability becomes your superpower as fatigue sets in during later stations like wall balls, where compression tops support proper shoulder positioning and trunk stability for those consistent, powerful reps .\nHere's what sets champions apart: compression wear enhances proprioception\u2014your body's awareness of position in space\u2014which dramatically improves technique during technical movements like farmers carries and lunges with weights\n\n. This heightened body awareness helps you maintain rock-solid form through fatigue, reducing injury risk while unlocking more powerful movement patterns . The stabilizing effect becomes a game-changer during the grueling 200m farmers carry, where compression sleeves support your upper back muscles and enhance grip endurance by improving circulation to those working forearms . Just like the intelligent training in the Quality compression gear takes your performance to the next level by improving inter-muscular coordination during compound movements.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Faster Recovery Between Intervals\n\nThe interval format of Hyrox Phoenix demands lightning-fast recovery between exercise stations\u2014and this is where compression gear truly shines. Through graduated pressure that enhances venous return, compression pushes metabolic waste products like lactic acid back to the heart more efficiently. This turbo-charged circulation helps your muscles clear fatigue-inducing compounds between stations, keeping you strong as you progress through the race. But it goes deeper than just clearing waste.\nCompression garments minimize inflammatory responses during high-intensity intervals by reducing available space for fluid accumulation in tissues. This becomes your secret weapon during later stations where accumulated fatigue typically destroys technique and power output. Beyond the physical benefits, the constant pressure provides proprioceptive feedback that keeps your body awareness sharp during transitions. Many devoted athletes report feeling mentally reset between stations when wearing compression gear\u2014it's like hitting a refresh button that allows laser focus and execution on each new challenge.\n\n\u2026\n\nElite athletes are turning to advanced fabric technologies designed specifically for hybrid races. Professional competitors favor gear that balances core support with smart ventilation\u2014keeping you stable during strength work while breathing during those runs\n\n. The key is finding compression that supports without suffocating. Look for training tights that maintain muscle support while managing your body temperature throughout the race . For upper body, functional compression vests with strategic ventilation have become game-changers\u2014they stabilize your core without limiting arm movement during rowing, ski erg, and those dreaded wall balls .\n\n\u2026\n\nFollow up with dynamic movements like leg swings, lunges, and glute bridges. Your compression tights provide instant feedback on your form, helping you dial in proper movement patterns before the race even begins\n\n. When you hit that easy 5-minute conversational run, your compression gear is already working overtime\u2014reducing those energy-wasting micro-vibrations and keeping your legs fresh for what's ahead . Pro tip from the experts: if you're practicing sled technique, keep it to one or two laps maximum. Your compression enhances force transfer, but save that power for when it counts .\n\n\u2026\n\n### During-Workout Wear for Consistent Support\n\nNow let's get real about race day\u2014this is where your compression gear proves its worth every damn step of the way. As we covered in the performance benefits section, compression delivers crucial muscle stabilization, enhanced circulation, and reduced fatigue throughout your race. But here's what that actually means when you're in the thick of competition. During those eight 1km runs, your compression tights are your secret weapon against the fatigue that creeps in after station five or six.\nThat stabilizing effect we talked about earlier? It's what keeps your form tight when everyone else starts falling apart\n\n. Through every strength station\u2014from sled pushes to wall balls\u2014compression maintains your body awareness and power transfer, exactly when technique matters most . The beauty of compression during racing is its consistency.\n\nWhile other athletes battle mounting inflammation and muscle breakdown, your gear keeps working silently in the background, managing blood flow and minimizing tissue damage\n\n\u2026\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\nCompression gear reduces micro-vibrations and stabilizes muscles across eight 1 km runs.\n\nGraduated 20-30 mmHg pressure boosts venous return, delaying fatigue during transitions.\n\nTargeted support limits knee/ankle compensation patterns, cutting injury risk from repeated impact.\n\nEnhanced proprioception keeps form tight on technical moves like farmer carries and wall balls.",

          "snippet": "**1. Is starting too fast dangerous?**\n\nThat first kilometer feels amazing, and the crowd\u2019s energy makes it hard to hold back. But going out at 5K speed when you need 8K of running and 8 workouts ahead is a recipe for burning out early.\n\n**Data check:** Elite men start around 3:45\u20134:00 per kilometer and slow by about 20 seconds mid-race. That drop-off gets worse for beginners who sprint out too hard.\n\n\u2026\n\nTrain smarter: Practice \u201cbrick\u201d workouts that combine running and HYROX stations. Use a stopwatch and track how fast you move between each part.\n\n**SugarWOD tip:** Log your transition times as notes. Over time, you\u2019ll start to notice where your flow breaks and how to smooth it out.\n\n**3. Nail your nutrition and hydration strategy**\n\n\u2026\n\n**SugarWOD tip:** Log what you eat before key workouts so you can see what helps you perform best. Race day is not the time to experiment.\n\n**4. Do you skip your warm-up to save energy?**\n\nSkipping a warm-up might seem like a good way to conserve energy, but it usually does the opposite. Cold muscles don\u2019t move well, and your first run will feel sluggish.\n\n\u2026\n\n**** **How heavy are the sleds?**\n\nMen push 152 kg and pull 103 kg, while women push 103 kg and pull 78 kg.\n\n**** **How should I train for HYROX?**\n\nAim for two running sessions, two HYROX-specific strength sessions, and one full race simulation every two to three weeks.",

          "snippet": "As with any event, but especially one that\u2019ll result in your sweating quite heavily, hydrating before the start line is hugely important. We recommend slightly upping your fluid intake AND your electrolyte intake in the 2 - 3 days period to your event. Electrolytes are crucial in maintaining the body\u2019s fluid balance, so a serving of an electrolyte drink such as VOOM Hydrate smart each day in the lead up to the event will help ensure you\u2019re ready to go. If you\u2019re a particularly heavy or salty sweater you may wish to up this slightly, or even supplement sodium intake as the most abundant electrolyte found in sweat.\nAgain on the day of the event we recommend sipping on 500ml of electrolyte mix in the three hours before the start. This ensures adequate hydration if you\u2019ve become dehydrated in the night or during travel to the venue. It will also help counteract losses made during your warm up as you begin to crank your body up!\nWith finish times ranging from just under 60 minutes to the 3 hour mark, (average finish time of around 90 minutes) hydration during the event can vary from competitor to competitor. Adequate fluid intake during the event is also influenced by the temperature in the venue and your own sweat rate. Hyrox provide a water station in the Rox Zone, meaning you\u2019ll pass it either just before or just after every workout station.\nIf you grab a cup and have a gulp of that, you\u2019re probably taking in 100 - 150ml of water each time, so we\u2019d normally recommend aiming for 4-600ml fluid intake per hour in events lasting over 60 minutes. People can get away with less than this, and some may go a full 90 minute event without drinking, but in terms of trying to minimise the performance slump that comes with dehydration, something is better than nothing!\n**Can I Carry My Own Drink During Hyrox?**\n\nAm I allowed to carry my own hydration or drinks during a Hyrox is a question that gets asked rather a lot! Carrying of drink bottles or hydration packs, including vest types, is allowed, although each workout station has its own unique challenges with regards to having drinks on your person. For example can you do burpee broad jumps without soft flasks flying out of your hydration belt, or can you comfortably sit a 20kg sandbag on your shoulders whilst wearing a drink vest?\nFor the vast majority our advice would be to utilise the water station which you\u2019ll pass 8 times during the event (once every time you go through the 'Rox Zone' to/from the workout stations.) If you are aware that you are likely to be taking longer than a couple of hours you may wish to consider carrying your own liquids, but a better option would probably be to take your time through the 'Rox Zone' and perhaps take on slightly more fluid at this point.\n\n\u2026\n\nIf your meal is three to four hours before race start you should look to take on up to 4g of carbohydrate per kg of body weight. So for a 75kg athlete, around 150g of carbohydrates, which might look like a large bowl of porridge made with semi-skimmed or whole milk, with a banana and some honey. Some people prefer small quantities of whole foods before racing so you may wish to supplement your meal with a carb drink, such as VOOM Fusion Fuel which packs an impressive 90g of carbohydrate per serving, and has the benefit of boosting fluid intake too.",

          "snippet": "### Do you really need to fuel and hydrate a HYROX?\n\nFor the uninitiated, HYROX is a unique blend of endurance and strength, featuring eight rounds that each consist of a one-kilometre run followed by a functional workout station. Finish times range from ~55 minutes for the elites to around three hours for those grinding it out, with the \u2018average competitor\u2019 clocking in at just under 90 minutes.\n\n\u2026\n\nAs well as burning through your glycogen stores, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019re going to be sweating a lot through those high intensity efforts. Inadequate fluid and sodium intake can result in progressive dehydration, leading to increased plasma osmolality, reduced blood volume, and impaired thermoregulation. This in turn can cause muscle cramping, decreased neuromuscular function, and cognitive decline.\nSo, replacing an adequate proportion of the fluid you lose through sweat (and the sodium you lose in that sweat) is very important to sustain your performance.\n\nBut before we consider how to approach fueling and hydration\n\n*during* a HYROX, it\u2019s important to ensure you get to the start line in optimal condition\u2026\n\n### How to START your HYROX fueled\n\nStarting well-fueled is critical - providing your body with the energy it needs to sustain the hard efforts and delay fatigue. When fully stocked, your body can store ~500g of glucose as glycogen in your muscles, and ~100g in your liver, which is enough to fuel moderate to high-intensity exercise for ~60-90 minutes.\n\n\u2026\n\n### How to START your HYROX hydrated\n\nMany athletes unknowingly start events dehydrated, which can negatively affect both performance and perceived effort. A 2019 review found that 40-50% of recreationally active individuals begin exercise in a mildly dehydrated state. To optimise hydration, try preloading with a strong electrolyte drink like PH 1500.\nTest out this preloading protocol before your longer and sweatier training sessions, so you\u2019re confident of implementing it on race day:\n\n**The night before**: Drink 1 x PH 1500 tablet or packet with ~500ml (~16oz) of water **90 minutes before** **exercise**: Drink 1 x PH 1500 tablet or packet with ~500ml (~16oz) of water to ensure you start fully hydrated\nElectrolytes - especially sodium - play an important role in fluid balance, muscle function, and preventing cramping. Preloading increases plasma volume, which gives you a hydration \u2018buffer\u2019 so you can sweat from a larger 'pool' of fluid, tolerate more sweat loss before performance suffers, and sustain performance for longer..\n\n### Should you eat and drink DURING a HYROX?\n\nGiven HYROX events typically last between 1-3 hours, a strategic approach to your carb intake can help maintain your energy levels by delaying glycogen depletion.\n\n**Fuel Tips:**\n- If you\u2019re racing for less than 75 minutes, carry some carb-rich gels or chews for quick energy boosts during the run or less intense moments. These can help top up energy levels without disrupting your rhythm\n\n- Given that HYROX involves high-intensity strength and endurance efforts over an extended period, effectively training your gut to tolerate carbs is crucial. Optimising the gastrointestinal system\u2019s ability to absorb and utilise fuel and fluids efficiently can help maintain hydration, sustain energy levels, and reduce the risk of gut distress. This ensures you can perform at high intensity without the discomfort or performance decline associated with poor nutrient absorption or dehydration\n\n\u2026\n\n*before*your HYROX could give you that extra boost - especially for later start times, when tiredness from the day may already be kicking in\n\n*Image Credit: F45 training \u00a9*\n\n**Hydration Tips:**\n\nWith limited opportunities to grab fluids (and the risk of turning the arena into a slip 'n slide if you have a particularly high sweat rate), starting well-hydrated is your best bet.\n- Studies have shown that more than a 2% loss of body weight from dehydration can reduce power output and impair cognitive function\n\n- Where possible, sip water at the aid stations in the Rox Zone to manage thirst and minimise fluid loss\n\n- Carrying a soft flask in your pocket or belt with some electrolytes can help maintain hydration and replenish sodium lost through heavy sweating (plus it\u2019s easy to discard when empty)\n\n##### How to fuel different race durations\n\n**Race duration: <75 minutes**\n\n- Focus on pre-event fueling to carry you through\n\n- Eat a caffeine gel or chew in the final 30 minutes before your competition starts\n\n- Carry an additional gel for a mid-race boost\n\n- Sip water from aid stations if needed\n**Race duration: 75 minutes \u2013 2 hours**\n\n- Eat a caffeine gel or chew in the last 30 minutes before the start\n\n- Aim for 30\u201360g of carbs per hour using gels or chews\n\n- Take them during easier sections or rest periods to avoid GI discomfort\n\n- Carry a 500ml (16oz) soft flask of electrolytes to stay hydrated and replace lost sodium\n**Race duration: >2 hours**\n\n- Eat a caffeine gel or chew in the last 30 minutes before the start\n\n- Aim for 30\u201360g of carbs per hour to prevent energy dips from glycogen depletion\n\n- Carry a 500ml (16oz) soft flask of electrolytes to stay hydrated and replace lost sodium\n\n- Take on additional fluid from aid stations as needed, particularly in humid environments\n\n\u2026\n\nIf you plan to train again soon, planning a more aggressive refueling strategy will help replace glycogen stores rapidly.\n\n**Hydration: Replace What You Lost**\n\nMost athletes finish HYROX dehydrated. PF&H COO, Jonny Tye carried out some sweat rate testing during his race simulation sessions and found that he loses 2-2.5L of sweat per hour. So, you\u2019re basically leaving a small puddle of yourself behind. Replacing lost fluids with electrolytes, not just water, is key to recovering properly.\n- High sweat rates are common in high-intensity events like HYROX, making rehydration with sodium crucial\n\n- If you\u2019re training again soon or have another race coming up, a more aggressive rehydration strategy is needed\n\n- In these cases, drinking PH 1500 within 30-60 minutes post-HYROX will aid fluid retention, restore electrolyte balance, and help you recover faster",

          "snippet": "**1. Starting Out Too Quickly**\n\nThe excitement of race day can make it tempting to start too fast, especially when everyone around you does the same. However, going out too hard can leave you struggling in the latter stages of the race.\n\n**How to avoid it:**\n\n\n\nPace yourself conservatively at the start; it\u2019s better to speed up later than burn out early.\nSimulate a full Hyrox race in training to get a feel for your sustainable pace.\n\n\n\nExpect your race pace to be closer to a half-marathon effort rather than a 5K sprint.\n\n**2. Not Knowing the Movement Standards**\n\nHyrox exercises are straightforward, but each has specific movement standards. If your form doesn\u2019t meet these standards, judges may give you \"no reps,\" costing you valuable time.\n**How to avoid it:**\n\n\n\nStudy the Hyrox rulebook to understand movement standards.\n\n\n\nPractice proper technique in training, especially for burpee broad jumps and wall balls.\n\n**3. Neglecting Compromised Running**\n\nRunning in Hyrox is far more challenging than regular running because you\u2019re doing it under fatigue. The transition from strength stations to running can feel like running in quicksand.\n**How to avoid it:**\n\n\n\nTrain with \u201ccompromised running\u201d workouts that simulate race conditions.\n\n\n\nPerform exercises like sled pushes or lunges before immediately transitioning into a run.\n\n**4. Running Too Many or Too Few Laps**\n\nLosing track of your laps is a common mistake that can lead to unnecessary fatigue or time penalties.\n**How to avoid it:**\n\n\n\nCheck the venue\u2019s lap count requirements in advance.\n\n\n\nUse the event\u2019s lap screen when possible, but also track laps manually or use a sports watch.\n\n**5. Not Tapering Before the Race**\n\nOvertraining too close to race day can leave you fatigued, while undertraining may leave you unprepared.\n**How to avoid it:**\n\n\n\nReduce training volume 1-2 weeks before race day, but maintain intensity.\n\n\n\nPlan rest days to ensure peak performance on race day.\n\n**6. Forgetting to Use Chalk**\n\nSweaty hands can make the sled pull and farmer\u2019s carry much harder than necessary.\n\n**How to avoid it:**\n\n\u2026\n\nUse the venue\u2019s screen for guidance, but don\u2019t rely on it entirely.\n\n**8. Wearing the Wrong Footwear**\n\nFootwear plays a crucial role in Hyrox, but many beginners wear CrossFit-style shoes that aren\u2019t optimized for running.\n\n**How to avoid it:**\n\n\n\nChoose running shoes with good grip and cushioning.\n\n\u2026\n\nIf you plan to use energy gels, test them in workouts first to ensure they agree with your stomach.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nHyrox is a demanding event, but with proper preparation and awareness of common mistakes, you can optimize your performance and avoid unnecessary setbacks. The key is to train smart, pace yourself well, and execute your plan effectively on race day. By focusing on these details, you can set yourself up for success and make the most out of your Hyrox experience. Good luck, and happy racing!",

          "snippet": "While HYROX is a relatively straightforward event, even experienced athletes can make mistakes which cost them time and energy.\n\nHere\u2019s some of the main ones to avoid in your next HYROX\u2026\n\n**1. Starting Out Too Quickly**\n\nIt is crucial to pace yourself during a HYROX event. It\u2019s very easy to start out much quicker than you ideally should \u2013 especially with all the excitement of the day. However, that can mean you make the latter stages of the race very hard for yourself.\n\n\u2026\n\nClick here to find out more about how to improve your performance on the HYROX Sled Push, and this article that takes about how to pace your running at HYROX.\n\n**2. Not Training Compromised Running**\n\nThe running during a HYROX event can feel much harder (and slower) than running a similar distance in isolation. The difference between running 1km on fresh legs, and running 1km after 100 meters of lunges, for example, is significant. Training this type of \u201ccompromised running\u201d, so that it\u2019s less of a shock during the race, is important.\nTo read more on compromised running, and how to train for it, check out this article.\n\n**3. Not Tapering Training**\n\nWhen I look on Instagram and see the amount of training certain competitors are still putting in during the week before a HYROX event, it always astounds me. I don\u2019t think we should believe everything we see on Instagram, of course. However, suffice to say, for the majority of people, tapering down your training in the 1-2 weeks prior to the race is usually a great idea if you want to feel fresh during the race.\n\n\u2026\n\n**5. CrossFit Shoes**\n\nChoosing the most appropriate footwear for HYROX is critical. One mistake many beginners to the sport make is to wear CrossFit type shoes \u2013 such as Nike Metcons or Reebok Nanos \u2013 for the race. They would, in general, be great for the functional exercises, but a huge portion of the race is running, and they simply aren\u2019t as good as most traditional running shoes for that job.\n\n\u2026\n\n**13. Changing Your Diet**\n\nYou\u2019ve heard about the need for more carbs (for energy) and decide a pre-race pasta party might be in order? Or a supplement company convinced you to buy a box of energy gels which you plan to chug down minutes before the race? Be careful. Dramatically changing what you eat in the days and hours before a race can be a big, all too common mistake.\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s something wrong with increased carb intake, or energy gels or anything like that. But don\u2019t leave it until just before the race to find out how you respond to those. Instead, it\u2019s something you should be testing well in advance. For example, energy gels can cause digestive distress for some people. Do you really want to find you\u2019re one of those people mid-HYROX? Probably not, and I\u2019m guessing the other athletes around you don\u2019t either!\n\nHopefully these tips will help you avoid any mistakes for your next HYROX.",

The Nike Free Metcon 6 is a lighter, cheaper, and more breathable option that is better equipped for a little bit of everything at the gym.\n\nAnother excellent cross-trainer to consider if versatility is high up your priority list is the Reebok Nano X4.\n\n## Cushioning\n\n### Shock absorption\n\nIf you've always wished for a touch more cushioning in a Nike Metcon, this iteration will answer your prayers! Introducing a new ReactX foam in the Metcon 10, Nike increased the shoe's shock absorption over the previous version quite tangibly.\n\nOur machine recorded 76 SA in the heel and 60 SA in the forefoot, which are respectively higher than the 69 SA and 51 SA of the Metcon 9.\n\nBut please note that both measurements are still below the average, and we wouldn't recommend using this Nike trainer for an entire cardio session, running more than a mile, or long bouts of walking. With its overall sturdy build and a rigid Hyperlift plate in the heel, the Metcon 10 stays true to its lifting-biased design.\n\n|Metcon 10|76 SA|\n|--|--|\n|Average|79 SA|\n### Energy return\n\nWe are also pleased to confirm the brand's promise of 'increased energy return' with the introduction of the new ReactX foam.\n\nThe Metcon 10 got more responsive with a rebound of 63% in the heel and 61.2% in the forefoot, making jumps and agility drills more fun and effortless.\n\nBut please take it with a grain of salt as well, because it's not a proper cardio shoe.\n\n|Metcon 10|63.0%|\n|--|--|\n|Average|54.8%|\n### Heel stack\n\nMeasuring the shoe's platform thickness, we didn't notice any major differences compared to the previous Metcon. It is an equally low-profile and grounded cross-trainer.\n\nOur caliper recorded a heel stack height of 22.8 mm, which is on the lower side of the training shoe spectrum.\n\n|Metcon 10|22.8 mm|\n|--|--|\n|Average|24.3 mm|\n### Forefoot stack\n\nAnd with a forefoot stack of 16.2 mm, the Metcon 10 keeps the toes close to the floor as well.\n\nPretty amazing how Nike managed to pack more impact protection into the new version without adding more millimeters to its stack height.\n\n|Metcon 10|16.2 mm|\n|--|--|\n|Average|18.1 mm|\n### Drop\n\nAt 6.6 mm, the shoe's heel-to-toe drop got a tad higher compared to the previous Metcons. But it is still on par with the current average of cross-strainers and feels like a grounded, low-drop trainer.\n\n|Metcon 10|6.6 mm|\n|--|--|\n|Average|6.3 mm|\n### Midsole softness\n\nThe Metcon 10 sees a huge drop in midsole firmness thanks to the ReactX foam.\n\nPressing our Shore A durometer against it, we recorded an exceptionally low reading of 19.5 HA, which is very unusual for this historically firm shoe series!\n\n|Metcon 10|19.5 HA|\n|--|--|\n|Average|27.8 HA|\n### Secondary foam softness\n\nBut don't worry about the wobbles because the soft compound is caged inside a firm carrier foam (29.5 HA) and is further stabilized by a stiff Hyperlift in the heel.\n\n|Metcon 10|29.5 HA|\n|--|--|\n|Average|35.1 HA|\n\n\u2026\n\n## Weight\n\nBut increased flexibility is not the only surprise that Nike throws at us in the new Metcon...The brand just slashed 2.3 oz off the past version!\n\nThe Metcon 10's weight clocks in at only 11.0 oz (312g) in a men's US size 9, making it lighter than the Reebok Nanos! Gone are the burly rubber wraps and the clunky TPU heel design. It looks like Nike has fine-tuned each component to make the overall construction as light as possible without compromising performance.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe Metcon 10 inherits the stiff TPU Hyperlift insert we've seen in the previous versions, but it's been reduced to the smallest possible size without affecting stability.\n\nThe polarizing rubber wraps of the v9 have been replaced with rubberized mesh, an internal midfoot band, and a strong pair of synthetic eyelets, all of which work together for a locked-in fit.\n\nThe midfoot rubber also remained on both sides of the shoe's midsole, but it received a more streamlined and aesthetic look.\n\n### Torsional rigidity\n\nFair enough, the Nike Metcon 10's torsional rigidity lost one point in our manual test, dropping down to 4 out of 5 on a stiffness scale.\n\nBut is that a problem? We don't think so because the shoe can still handle heavier loads without a problem, while the increased forefoot flexibility makes it more versatile for all-around use.\n\n|Metcon 10|4|\n|--|--|\n|Average|2.9|\n\n\u2026\n\n### Midsole width - forefoot\n\nMeasuring the shoe's midsole dimensions, our caliper revealed that the Metcon 10 has undergone some changes in the heel but not in the forefoot.\n\nThe outrigger is still present here, resulting in a wide reading of 115.2 mm in the broadest area. Wider than average, it minimizes the risk of foot rolling during forceful lateral movements or when picking up heavier weight.\n\n|Metcon 10|115.2 mm|\n|--|--|\n|Average|110.9 mm|\n\n### Midsole width - heel\n\nThe heel, on the other hand, shrank by 4.2 mm, showing 90.8 mm in its broadest part.\n\nWe believe that it was a smart update as the shoe lost the unnecessary bulk while remaining adequately stable for a cross-training shoe. In fact, even advanced lifting shoes typically have a heel width of 85-90 mm.\n\n|Metcon 10|90.8 mm|\n|--|--|\n|Average|86.9 mm|\n\n\u2026\n\nSecond, the heel and forefoot (black) Sticky Rubber.\n\nOur test showed that this compound wasn't much better than the other one, developing a dent of 1.12 mm. This is, again, on par with the category average, and we expected stronger results from Nike's best training shoe.\n\nWe highly recommend limiting the shoe's use to the gym/indoor venues if you hope to get as much lifespan from it as possible.\n\n|Metcon 10|1.2 mm|\n|--|--|\n|Average|1.1 mm|\n\n\u2026\n\n### Price\n\nEven though it's been two years since the previous iteration, we are glad that Nike only upped the MSRP by $5. Even though it's the brand's leading cross-trainer, its price remains competitive with similar models and relatively affordable for many gym goers and Crossfitters.\n\n|Metcon 10|$155|\n|--|--|\n|Average|$125|",

It sacrifices the soft, sock-like upper of its predecessors for a sturdy, stability-focused build which is better for weightlifting. It\u2019s a move Puma needed to make to compete with the big hitters of the CrossFit world, but the added weight is noticeable and I miss the comfort of the 2.0.\n\n#### For\n\n- Stable for weight lifting\n\n- Robust build\n\n#### Against\n\n- Heavy\n\n- Narrow forefoot\n\n- Unappealing design\n\nYou can trust Coach\n\nThe Puma Fuse 2.0 has been my favorite budget CrossFit shoe for some time, delivering superior comfort and a springy yet supportive midsole that\u2019s suitable for pretty much any WOD. So when its successor was released with a $20 higher retail price, the pressure was on for the brand to deliver.\nThe dramatic nature of Puma\u2019s redesign was apparent to me as soon as I pulled them on. The upper feels firmer, the forefoot seems narrower, the shoe is noticeably heavier and the heel is a different beast entirely thanks to several new stability features.\n\nOverall, I do believe the upgrade has furthered Puma\u2019s mission to make the best CrossFit shoe, but this might be a case of taking one step back to take two forward.\n\n## Puma Fuse 3.0: Price And Availability\n\nThe Puma Fuse 3.0 costs $120 in the US and \u00a3100 in the UK. That\u2019s a $20/\u00a310 price rise on the Puma Fuse 2.0 and brings the 3.0 more in line with well-established CrossFit shoe brands, which typically charge north of $130.\n\nThe Puma Fuse 2.0 was often discounted and I\u2019d expect the 3.0 to follow suit so it may be worth shopping around after six months.\n\n\u2026\n\nThere are also sturdy heel and toe guards for protection during wall walks and handstand push-ups, along with extra raised rubber sections around the midsole for rope climbs and lateral support.\n\nThis catalog of new stability features delivered just that: superior stability. But they do add weight to the shoe, making it feel less nimble than its predecessor. The Puma Fuse 3.0 weighs 454g in my UK size 10. The Puma Fuse 2.0 is 405g and my one-time favorite TYR CXT-1 is 348g.\n\n\u2026\n\nIt beats its predecessor for stability thanks to the redesigned heel, and there\u2019s no questioning the purchase afforded by the PUMAGRIP outsole. As a result I quite liked the shoe for barbell-heavy workouts like Grace.\n\nBut as soon as I had to move fast, I noticed the shoe\u2019s heavy heel. This was particularly apparent during longer workouts like a 40-minute EMOM I tackled while wearing them.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Is The Puma Fuse 3.0 Good For Running?\n\nThe restrictive forefoot and weight meant that the Puma Fuse 3.0 didn\u2019t impress during short (up to 400m) mid-WOD running intervals.\n\nCompared with other CrossFit shoes I\u2019ve tried, it didn\u2019t feel as nimble, springy or energetic, although it wasn\u2019t as clunky as the Nike Metcon 9.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Is The Puma Fuse 3.0 Worth It?\n\nI\u2019m going to save you some money here. If you want a great budget CrossFit shoe, buy the Puma Fuse 2.0. If you want Puma\u2019s best CrossFit shoe, buy the Puma Fuse 2.0. In fact, if you want a great CrossFit shoe full stop, you could still buy the Puma Fuse 2.0.\nThe main problem with the Puma Fuse 2.0 was its lack of stability in the heel, with a little compression in the heel when under heavier weights. The Puma Fuse 3.0 has solved this problem, delivering a superbly stable heel with an innovative angular design to stop unwanted lateral movement. This is something the brand needed to fix to compete for the title of \u201cbest CrossFit shoe\u201d\u2014but the improvements have come at a cost.\nThe shoe feels heavy during WODs, the weighting seems to be off in favor of the back of the shoe, the midsole lacks energy and my foot feels uncomfortably cramped along the sides of the midfoot and forefoot.\n\nI\u2019m hoping Puma can marry the stability of this shoe with the attributes of its predecessor with its next functional fitness-focused release. But for now, the unparalleled comfort of the Fuse 2.0 makes it my preferred Puma training shoe.",

          "snippet": "The\n\n**good** news is that the Metcon 10 is a step in the right direction for this shoe line **.** It has remnants of the older Metcons in terms of fit. It also comes with better versatility, which I\u2019ll cover in my performance section below. The **bad** news is that I think there will still be some issues with its sizing, and it hasn\u2019t fixed *everything* that plagued the 9.\n\n## Nike Metcon 10\n\n## $155Stability\n\n### Pros\n\n- Stable for lifting\n\n- Athletic feeling upper\n\n- Good for arch support lovers\n\n### Cons\n\n- Not flat feet friendly\n\n- Still lacks versatility\n\n- Upper volume is hit or miss\n\n### Best For\n\n- Lifting\n\n- CrossFit\n\n- Cross-Training\n\n- Arch Support Lovers\n\n- Low Volume Feet\n\n### Specs\n\n|Heel-to-Toe Drop|4mm|\n|--|--|\n|Weight|11.80 oz (size 10)|\n|Width|Medium/Wide|\n|Lifting Threshold|~455 lbs|\n|Run Distance Threshold|<1,200 at one time|\n\n\u2026\n\n- You LOVED the older Nike Metcon\u2019s fit. More specifically, you loved the Metcon 3-5\u2019s fit. The Metcon 10 has a low-profile upper which gives them that classic, sporty and athletic feel and fit that some love from Nike.\n\n- You need a training shoe primarily for lifting with some CrossFit and cross-training sprinkled in. Similar to the 9, the Metcon 10 does have a larger bias towards stability with its construction. If your asks primarily revolve around heavy strength and power work, then the Metcon 10 can be a solid option to explore.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Performance Assessment\n\n### Great for Lifting: 8.5/10\n\nLifter rejoice, Nike reworked the Hyperlift plate in this shoe. The Hyperlift plate was initially brought into the Metcon line in the 7, and it\u2019s since been a feature that has created some polarization in the training shoe scene. For example, I\u2019m not a fan of it and I don\u2019t think trainers need plastic in their heels to be stable, but some do love it and I acknowledge that.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Stable Option for CrossFit/Cross-Training: 7.5/10\n\nThe 10 is definitely improved for CrossFit and cross-training compared to the 9. For CrossFit, going down the line, here\u2019s where this shoe has been improved. First, the React midsole has more pliability, which has been a nice update for box jumps and double-unders.\n\n\u2026\n\nIf you\u2019re going to run in the Metcon 10 for short distances, I\u2019d HIGHLY recommend trying to keep them to treadmills and the Assault Runner. If you\u2019re running outdoors or you\u2019re a heel striker, I think you\u2019ll be super uncomfortable in these.\n\nAll that said, the Metcon 10, much like the 9, is not a great training shoe for workouts with running over 1,000 meters at one time due to its midsole density and the Hyperlift plate in its heel.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Final Remarks: Would I Buy Again?\n\nYes and no.\n\nAt the end of the day, the Nike Metcon 10 delivers on what it\u2019s optimized to do, which is to be a stable training shoe for lifting that can work for CrossFit.\n\nIf you\u2019ve missed the older Metcons, then you\u2019ll like this shoe and I think you\u2019ll enjoy their performance. It is objectively a better shoe compared to the 9 \u2014 or at least I think the vast majority of lifters and athletes will think this.",

          "snippet": "The gym experience can be amplified by choosing footwear that aligns with your goals. If you\u2019re lifting heavy\u2026you\u2019re in the right place. The Puma Fuse 3.0 is meant for anyone that wants to throw some heavy weight around.\n\n##\n\n**Puma Fuse 3.0**\n\n**Release Date:** January 8, 2024\n\n**Price:** $120\n\n**Drop:** 4mm\n\n**Fit:** True to size\n\n\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s built stable and low to the ground with a dual density midsole that\u2019s firm but offers extra flexibility in the forefoot. You can actually see and feel the dual density setup when you pull the drop-in midsole out of the shoe. In addition to the foam being different colors, you can feel it\u2019s a bit softer up front and firmer in the back (which is reminiscent of the GoRuck Ballistic Trainer\u2019s drop-in midsole).\nThe Fuse 3.0 includes medial and lateral rope guards, a HEX TPU heel clip with outriggers for even more support, with a poly mesh and TPU coated yarn knit upper for a combination of durability and flexibility.\n\nBasically, it\u2019s got almost everything you\u2019d want from this category of cross trainer. But is it enough for high performance?\n\n\u2026\n\nThe Puma Fuse 3.0 does not excel at cardio. I\u2019d liken running in the Fuse 3.0 to a barefoot running experience, but with a clunkier heel than what you\u2019re born with. The cushion just stops being effective after 100 meters or so. It can handle sprints, but anything longer than 100 meters gets real uncomfortable, real fast. If you want to do a lot of running in your workout shoes, the Fuse 3.0 isn\u2019t the right choice.\n\n## Pros\n\n- Top tier stability\n\n- Great ground feel\n\n- Durable upper\n\n- Tacky Puma Grip outsole\n\n## Cons\n\n- Narrow toebox\n\n- Sizing (go up a half size)\n\n- Clunky heel\n\n- Big toe area needs extra break-in time due to overlays\n\n- Drop-in midsole means orthotics and insoles don\u2019t work\n\n\u2026\n\n## Is the Puma Fuse 3.0 worth $120\n\nYes, the Puma Fuse 3.0 justifies its $120 price tag. With most of the competition for this shoe at $140 or $150, the Fuse 3.0 delivers good value. It\u2019s one of the better options for those looking to lift heavy on a budget.\n\n## Puma Fuse 3.0 Summary\n\nThe Puma Fuse 3.0 is focused on keeping the wearer stable while they lift weights. It locks the foot down to the ground with the always amazing Puma Grip outsole, various outriggers, PWR TAPE overlays, and a beefy heel.\n\nIt\u2019s not cushioned enough and too clunky for cardio but it\u2019ll handle sprints. The Puma Fuse 3.0 is also priced $20-30 cheaper than the competition so while it\u2019s not perfect, it delivers high end stability and durability for the price.",

Granted, these changes, along with our economy, brought the price of this shoe from $100 to $120 \u2014 which is also a change.\n\n### Fuse 2 to Fuse 3 Major Changes\n\n**Reworked sole**: The Fuse 3\u2019s midfoot and heel have been changed. The midfoot is denser and built-out and the heel now features a more squared and rigid construction. **New upper**: In the Fuse 3, you now have a slightly heavier upper construction, a PWRTAPE strip on the medial side of the forefoot, and an asymmetrical lacing system.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Is It Worth Upgrading? My Opinion\n\nI mentioned above that it took me a minute to appreciate the Fuse 3\u2019s updates. However, I\u2019ve since come to enjoy this shoe for what it is and see it as a good \u201cbudget\u201d option for lifting and CrossFit-focused athletes.\n\nI think if you\u2019re torn between the PUMA Fuse 2 and Fuse 3 and budget ISN\u2019T a constraint, then I\u2019d go newer in this context. The Fuse 3 just feels like a stronger training shoe. It feels kind of similar to the Nike Metcon 7 and 8.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Final Verdict\n\nThe PUMA Fuse 3 is a step in the right direction for the Fuse shoe line. This model is starting to feel more like a modern-day cross-training shoe that\u2019s built for lifting and CrossFit.\n\nWith a more stable feeling and improved durability, I see the Fuse 3 as a good middle-of-the-pack training shoe for the athlete and lifter who needs a versatile gym shoe for heavy-strength work.\n\nIf you have additional questions on the Fuse 3, drop a comment below or reach out to me via Instagram (@jake_boly or @that_fit_friend).\n\n## Add a Comment",

          "text": "Now I have comprehensive data. Let me compile this into the complete knowledge base document.\n\n---\n\n# HYROX Equipment Knowledge Base \u2014 Verified Guidance for AI Coach v2\n\n> **Document Purpose:** This knowledge base corrects the dangerous equipment recommendations made by the v1 AI coach model (which recommended Nike Vaporfly Next% as the \"#1 Hyrox shoe\") and provides verified, source-backed equipment guidance for Hyrox athletes.\n\n---\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f CRITICAL CORRECTION: The Vaporfly Error\n\n**What the v1 model claimed:** \"Nike Vaporfly Next% is the #1 Hyrox shoe with 4%+ VO2max improvement from the carbon plate.\"\n\n**What the research actually shows:**\n- The ~4% figure refers to a reduction in **metabolic cost of running** (energy cost in watts/kg), **NOT** a VO2max improvement. The original 2017 University of Colorado study by Hoogkamer et al. measured that \"averaged over three speeds, the Vaporfly's metabolic cost was 4.0 percent lower\" than control shoes. Individual results ranged from 1.59% to 6.26%. *(Source: Runner's World reporting on Hoogkamer et al., Sports Medicine, 2017; PMC peer-reviewed study PMC9189709)*\n- VO2max is a physiological ceiling \u2014 no shoe changes it. The shoe reduces the energy cost of running at a given speed, which is a completely different metric.\n- This benefit applies **only to straight-line running on flat surfaces**. It provides zero benefit during functional fitness stations, and active detriment on several.\n\n**Why Vaporfly/Alphafly are DANGEROUS for Hyrox:**\n\n| Risk Factor | Explanation | Source |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Zero lateral stability** | 40mm stack height with narrow platform creates ankle injury risk during lunges, burpee broad jumps, and sled work | RunRepeat lab testing; Muscle & Fitness Hyrox guide |\n| **No grip on sled surfaces** | Minimal outsole rubber \u2014 companies \"minimise the amount the shoe weighs by sacrificing rubber on the outsole\" | RoxLyfe footwear guide |\n| **Carbon plate fragility** | Carbon plates are designed for forward propulsion only; lateral loading and ground contact during burpees can damage the plate | Multiple coaching sources |\n| **Shoe destruction** | Super shoes are not designed for the abrasion of convention center floors, sled turf, and burpee ground contact \u2014 expect significant damage in one race | RunRepeat toebox durability testing |\n| **Rower interference** | High stack height shoes have difficulty fitting into Concept2 rower heel cups, costing seconds per transition | RunRepeat Hyrox shoe guide |\n| **Lunge depth issues** | Higher stack means your knee must travel further to touch the ground during sandbag lunges \u2014 reps may not count | RunRepeat: \"choosing shoes with 40+ mm heel stack...making it harder for some reps to count\" |\n| **$200-$250 cost wasted** | Racing flats designed for 1-2 road races cannot survive Hyrox station demands | General pricing data |\n\n---\n\n## 1. FOOTWEAR FOR HYROX\n\n### 1.1 The Hyrox Shoe Problem\n\nHyrox is uniquely challenging for footwear because athletes must perform two fundamentally opposed activities in the same shoe:\n\n**Running demands (8km total):** Cushioning, energy return, lightweight, responsive midsole, forward-propulsion geometry\n**Station demands (8 functional exercises):** Grip on carpet/turf, lateral stability, low-to-ground connection, durability against abrasion, flexibility for squats/lunges, ability to fit into rower foot plates\n\nAs Hyrox performance coach Jacob Ruch (CSCS) stated: *\"HYROX is a running race accumulating 5+ miles; comfort, stability, and then grip, in that order, should drive your shoe choice.\"* *(Source: Muscle & Fitness)*\n\n**The 5 Key Properties for a Hyrox Shoe:**\n\n1. **Grip/Traction** \u2014 Primarily for sled push (your feet slip on the Centr x HYROX Perform Turf surface), sled pull, and wet venue floors. Look for textured rubber outsoles with moderate lugs. *(Source: RunRepeat, RoxLyfe)*\n2. **Cushioning** \u2014 Moderate stack height (30-38mm heel recommended). Enough to handle 8km of running without destroying your legs, but not so much you lose ground feel. *(Source: RunRepeat, Centr)*\n3. **Lateral Stability** \u2014 A wide base and firm midsole for lunges, burpee broad jumps, and sled work. Torsional rigidity of at least 3/5 is ideal. *(Source: RunRepeat lab testing)*\n4. **Durability** \u2014 Convention center surfaces, burpee ground contact, and sled turf are brutal on shoes. The toebox and heel padding must withstand abrasion. *(Source: RunRepeat durability testing)*\n5. **Heel shape/fit** \u2014 Must fit into Concept2 rower heel cups without wasting time. Avoid shoes with flared or unconventional heel designs. Also needs a strong heel counter to prevent slippage during sled pushes. *(Source: RunRepeat, RoxLyfe)*\n\n### 1.2 What the Top Athletes Actually Wear\n\nBased on direct athlete reporting from RoxLyfe (competitive athlete survey, updated 2025):\n\n| Athlete | Achievement | Shoe |\n|---|---|---|\n| Linda Meier | 2025 World Champion (Women) | Puma Deviate Nitro 3 Elite |\n| Tim Wenisch | 2025 World Champion (Men) | Adidas (prototype) |\n| Hunter McIntyre | Elite competitor | Puma Deviate Nitro 3 |\n| Megan Jacoby | Elite competitor | Puma Deviate Nitro 3 Elite |\n| Lauren Weeks | Elite competitor | Mizuno Wave Rebellion Pro |\n| Kate Davey | Elite competitor | Saucony Endorphin Pro |\n| Alexander Roncevic | Elite competitor | ON Cloudboom Echo 3 |\n| Joanna Wietrzyk | Elite competitor | Puma Deviate Nitro 3 |\n| James Kelly | Elite competitor | Puma Deviate Nitro 2 Elite |\n\n**Key insight:** Elite athletes overwhelmingly favor **running-biased shoes with adequate grip**, NOT cross-trainers. Puma Deviate Nitro models dominate at the elite level, partly because Puma is the official HYROX sponsor, but also because the shoe's PUMAGRIP outsole provides genuine traction on sled surfaces while maintaining race-level running performance.\n\nA Resilience Fitness community survey (45 athletes) found Puma Deviate Nitro 3 and Deviate Nitro Elite 3 made up ~40% of all shoe choices. *(Source: Resilience Fitness Hyrox Gear Guide 2025)*\n\n**Critical distinction for the AI coach:** The shoe recommendation should differ based on the athlete's level and priorities. Elites choose running-fast shoes because they have the strength to handle stations regardless. Beginners and intermediate athletes often benefit more from hybrid options that provide stability across all stations.\n\n### 1.3 Specific Shoe Recommendations\n\n#### CATEGORY A: Running-Biased Shoes (Prioritize 8km speed, adequate station performance)\n\n**Puma Deviate Nitro 3 / Deviate Nitro 3 Elite / Deviate Nitro Elite HYROX**\n- **Price:** ~$170-$200 (Elite ~$220-250)\n- **Stack:** ~36-39mm heel\n- **Drop:** ~8-10mm\n- **Pros for Hyrox:** Best-in-class PUMAGRIP outsole for sled work; NITROFOAM Elite provides excellent energy return; carbon/nylon PWRPLATE for propulsion; the official HYROX x Puma shoe (launching Feb 19, 2026) was designed specifically for the sport with a \"full-coverage, high traction PUMAGRIP outsole\" and \"specially engineered lug pattern.\" *(Sources: RoxLyfe, Men's Health, RunRepeat)*\n- **Cons for Hyrox:** Narrow platform; high stack can feel less stable on lunges; not the most planted shoe for lateral work; potential fit issues for wide feet *(Source: RunRepeat, Muscle & Fitness)*\n- **Best for:** Competitive athletes (sub-75 min) who prioritize run splits; anyone comfortable with the slightly-less-stable platform during stations\n- **Elite athlete endorsement:** Worn by both 2025 World Champions and the majority of the Elite 15 field\n\n**Saucony Endorphin Speed 5 (nylon plate \u2014 NOT the carbon-plated Pro)**\n- **Price:** ~$160-$170\n- **Pros for Hyrox:** Top-level PWRRUN PB foam; nylon plate (more flexible than carbon); excellent energy return (RunRepeat: 132 SA heel shock absorption, 71.6% heel energy return); SPEEDROLL geometry for smooth transitions *(Source: RunRepeat)*\n- **Cons for Hyrox:** Toebox durability concerns (failed RunRepeat durability test); less grip than Puma models\n- **Best for:** Runner-dominant athletes who want a speed shoe with better flexibility than a pure carbon racer\n\n**Saucony Endorphin Pro 4 (carbon plate \u2014 use with awareness)**\n- **Price:** ~$200-$240\n- **Pros for Hyrox:** PWRRUN HG foam + carbon plate = propulsive ride; broader forefoot platform than many super shoes; reinforced outsole rubber provides decent grip for sled work *(Source: RoxLyfe)*\n- **Cons for Hyrox:** Carbon plate reduces forefoot flexibility for lunges; too unstable for lateral/loaded movements per Muscle & Fitness testing; narrow platform\n- **Best for:** Advanced/elite athletes who are confident in their station strength and want maximum run speed. Multiple elite athletes (Kate Davey, Vivian Tafuto, Jon Wynn) race in these. *(Source: RoxLyfe)*\n- **\u26a0\ufe0f AI coach note:** This is a legitimate choice for strong athletes, unlike the Vaporfly. The Endorphin Pro has more outsole rubber, a wider forefoot, and better grip than the Vaporfly. However, it is still a compromise \u2014 recommend only to experienced athletes who have tested it on sleds.\n\n**Hoka Mach 6**\n- **Price:** ~$140\n- **Pros for Hyrox:** RunRepeat rates it the most stable among Hyrox running shoes; high 4/5 torsional rigidity despite plush cushioning; 67.5% heel energy return, 74.2% forefoot energy return; responsive and lightweight *(Source: RunRepeat)*\n- **Cons for Hyrox:** Snug toebox (issue for wide feet); narrower fit\n- **Best for:** Stability-conscious runners who want running performance without sacrificing too much ground feel\n\n**Nike Pegasus 41**\n- **Price:** ~$130-$140\n- **Pros for Hyrox:** Great all-around daily trainer; ZoomX and ReactX foams for cushioning; waffle-shaped outsole provides decent traction; very accessible entry-level option; good stability for a running shoe *(Source: Men's Health, Muscle & Fitness)*\n- **Cons for Hyrox:** Soft midsole reduces stability under load; limited grip compared to Puma models; not the fastest\n- **Best for:** First-timers who already own Pegasus; budget-conscious athletes wanting a versatile option\n\n**Adidas Adizero Boston 12**\n- **Price:** ~$140-$160\n- **Pros for Hyrox:** Light, versatile, speed-oriented; Continental rubber outsole (excellent grip and durability); wider forefoot; layered foam midsole for stability *(Source: Men's Health)*\n- **Cons for Hyrox:** Still running-biased \u2014 less lateral support than training shoes\n- **Best for:** Athletes wanting a fast shoe with genuinely good outsole grip\n\n**On Cloud X 4 / On Cloudflow**\n- **Price:** ~$140-$160\n- **Pros for Hyrox:** On Cloudmonster praised for \"cushion for the runs, control for sled work\" by Resilience Fitness coaches; Cloud X is designed as a hybrid training/running shoe; lightweight and responsive *(Source: Resilience Fitness)*\n- **Cons for Hyrox:** CloudTec pods can feel unusual; limited lateral support; grip concerns on turf surfaces; the Cloudflow is better for running but worse for stations\n- **Best for:** Runner-dominant athletes who prefer On's ride feel and have tested them on sleds\n\n#### CATEGORY B: Cross-Training / Hybrid Shoes (Prioritize station performance, adequate running)\n\n**Nike Metcon 9 / Metcon 10**\n- **Price:** $150-$155\n- **Weight:** 11.0 oz / 312g (Metcon 10, men's 9)\n- **Stack:** 22.8mm heel / 16.2mm forefoot\n- **Drop:** 6.6mm (Metcon 10)\n- **Pros for Hyrox:** \"Rock-solid\" stability for sled work, lunges, and wall balls; wide forefoot base (115.2mm); excellent grip on gym/indoor floors; extremely durable upper; Hyperlift plate for heavy lifting; Metcon 10 has improved ReactX foam for better energy return (63% heel) than previous versions *(Sources: RunRepeat, Muscle & Fitness, multiple reviews)*\n- **Cons for Hyrox:** **Very limited running comfort beyond ~1km at a time.** The Hyperlift plate makes heel striking painful; low stack means insufficient cushioning for 8km of running; \"Not the most comfortable but it can work for like one to three miles.\" The Metcon 10 review from ThatFitFriend states running distances should be kept under 1,200m at a time. *(Sources: RunRepeat, ThatFitFriend, RoxLyfe)*\n- **Best for:** Strength-dominant athletes who are slow runners anyway and want maximum station performance; athletes whose race will take 90+ minutes where station efficiency matters more than run speed\n- **\u26a0\ufe0f AI coach note:** RoxLyfe explicitly states \"CrossFit shoes \u2013 like the Puma Fuse or Nike Metcon's \u2013 aren't appropriate for HYROX\" due to running discomfort. However, some athletes do use them successfully, especially those prioritizing stations. Be transparent about the tradeoff.\n\n**Nike Free Metcon 6**\n- **Price:** ~$125\n- **Weight:** 274g (men's)\n- **Stack:** 22mm heel / 14.8mm forefoot\n- **Drop:** 7.2mm\n- **Pros for Hyrox:** \"Combines flexibility with structure\"; snug fit and firm platform for multi-directional movements; cheaper than Metcon 10; more flexible than standard Metcon *(Source: Muscle & Fitness)*\n- **Cons for Hyrox:** Minimal cushioning; \"less ideal for distances over 800 meters of running\"; tighter build\n- **Best for:** Budget-conscious athletes who want a gym-friendly shoe and accept slower run splits\n\n**Reebok Nano X4 / Nano X5**\n- **Price:** ~$135-$140\n- **Pros for Hyrox:** Stable heel and wide forefoot; rugged outsole with excellent traction; breathable upper; strong all-around CrossFit shoe; good hybrid function *(Source: Muscle & Fitness, multiple reviews)*\n- **Cons for Hyrox:** \"On the heavier side for running\"; \"stiff during toe-off\"; running comfort decreases notably after the first few kilometers\n- **Best for:** CrossFit athletes transitioning to Hyrox who already own Nanos; strength-dominant competitors\n\n**TYR CXT-1 Trainer**\n- **Price:** ~$140-$160\n- **Weight:** ~348g\n- **Drop:** 9mm heel-to-toe\n- **Pros for Hyrox:** Rated \"Best Overall\" by one review for balanced run + strength; Surge NRG foam dual midsole for energy return; \"incredibly solid base\" with patent-pending stability platform; excellent grip on various gym surfaces including turf; wider toe box for natural toe splay; 9mm drop provides a slight lift helpful for squat depth *(Sources: TYR CXT-1 video review, Aqil Fitness)*\n- **Cons for Hyrox:** Break-in period can feel stiff; premium pricing; less cushioning than running shoes for 8km; relatively new brand in the space\n- **Best for:** Functional fitness athletes wanting the most versatile single shoe for both training and racing; athletes with mobility limitations who benefit from the 9mm drop\n\n**NOBULL Trainer / NOBULL Runner+**\n- **Price:** ~$130-$160\n- **Pros for Hyrox:** Wider toe box; grippy outsole; minimal drop for ground control; extremely durable \u2014 \"feels like armor for your feet during lunges and carries\" *(Source: Aqil Fitness)*\n- **Cons for Hyrox:** Heavier than most options; firm ride; not ideal for runners who need cushioning; the Trainer is very much a gym shoe\n- **Best for:** Athletes who value durability and don't mind sacrificing some running comfort; the Runner+ model is slightly more running-capable\n\n**Puma Fuse 2.0 / Fuse 3.0**\n- **Price:** $100-$120\n- **Pros for Hyrox:** Excellent PUMAGRIP outsole; very stable for lifting; budget-friendly; Fuse 2.0 praised for superior comfort *(Source: Coach Web, WearTesters, ThatFitFriend)*\n- **Cons for Hyrox:** **Not recommended for Hyrox racing.** \"The Puma Fuse 3.0 does not excel at cardio... cushion just stops being effective after 100 meters or so.\" The Fuse 3.0 weighs 454g (heavy); narrow toebox; clunky heel. RoxLyfe explicitly advises against Fuse shoes for Hyrox racing. *(Sources: WearTesters, Coach Web, RoxLyfe)*\n- **Best for:** Hyrox training sessions focused on station work ONLY, not race day; budget training shoe\n\n**GORUCK Ballistic Trainer**\n- **Price:** ~$135-$165\n- **Pros for Hyrox:** Breathable; flexible from ball of foot to toe; good midsole rigidity; high-density EVA midsole; durable construction designed for rucking and training *(Source: GORUCK review videos)*\n- **Cons for Hyrox:** Limited availability; less established in Hyrox community; heavier than running shoes\n- **Best for:** Military/rucking athletes crossing into Hyrox; athletes who want extreme durability\n\n**Under Armour TriBase Reign**\n- **Price:** ~$100-$140\n- **Pros for Hyrox:** Low-cut and lightweight; excels in agility work; Micro G Foam midsole for responsive ground strikes; good for jumping and dynamic movements *(Source: UA TriBase Reign review)*\n- **Cons for Hyrox:** Less cushioning than running shoes; less proven in Hyrox community; grip not as tested on sled surfaces\n- **Best for:** Budget-conscious athletes; training shoe for Hyrox prep workouts\n\n### 1.4 Shoe Selection by Athlete Type\n\n**Runner-Dominant Athlete** (strong cardio, weaker stations, likely finishing 65-85 min):\n- **Prioritize:** Energy return, lightweight, cushioning for 8km\n- **Top picks:** Puma Deviate Nitro 3 (Elite), Saucony Endorphin Speed 5, Adidas Adizero Boston 12\n- **Logic:** Your run splits are your weapon. A shoe that costs you 10-15 seconds per km over 8km = 80-120 seconds total. Station time differences between shoe types are smaller (~5-15 seconds per station for most athletes).\n\n**Strength-Dominant Athlete** (strong stations, weaker running, likely finishing 80-100+ min):\n- **Prioritize:** Grip, stability, comfort over longer duration\n- **Top picks:** Nike Pegasus 41, Hoka Mach 6, TYR CXT-1\n- **Logic:** Your stations are already fast. You need a shoe comfortable enough to keep your running legs working across 8km. Don't sacrifice 2+ minutes on running splits to gain 15 seconds on sled push grip.\n\n**First-Timer** (finishing 85-120+ min):\n- **Prioritize:** Comfort, stability, grip \u2014 in that order. Don't overthink it.\n- **Top picks:** Nike Pegasus 41 (if you own running shoes), TYR CXT-1 or Reebok Nano X4 (if you come from CrossFit)\n- **Key advice:** \"Wear the shoes you've trained in.\" *(Source: Wheelhouse Academy, RoxLyfe)* Breaking in new shoes on race day = blisters and distraction. Test on a heavy sled push before race day.\n- **Budget option:** Brooks Ghost 17 (~$140) \u2014 \"Well-cushioned and stable enough for beginner hybrid workouts at a lower price point\" *(Source: Muscle & Fitness)*\n\n**Experienced Competitor** (sub-75 min, targeting podium/worlds qualification):\n- **Top picks:** Puma Deviate Nitro Elite HYROX (when available), Puma Deviate Nitro 3 Elite, Saucony Endorphin Pro 4\n- **Strategy:** At this level, you likely know your feet and your weaknesses. Some elite athletes even use a two-shoe strategy (starting in running shoes, switching at a station) though this is rare and adds transition time.\n\n### 1.5 What NOT to Wear \u2014 and Exactly Why\n\n**\u274c Carbon-Plate Racing Flats (Nike Vaporfly, Nike Alphafly, Saucony Endorphin Pro in the wrong hands)**\n- 40mm+ stack height with narrow platform = ankle injury risk during lateral movements\n- Minimal outsole rubber = feet slip on sled push/pull carpet surface\n- Carbon plate is rigid = significantly reduces forefoot flexibility needed for lunges and burpees (some carbon shoes measured at 25N stiffness vs. 13N average for Hyrox shoes) *(Source: RunRepeat)*\n- Shoe designed for 1-2 road races = will be destroyed by convention center floors and sled turf\n- $200-$275 cost = wasted on a shoe that can't do half the race\n- The energy return benefit only helps on 8km of running, and is partially or fully negated by time lost on stations\n- As one Hyrox video creator stated: \"Is the 2-3% return that you get from these shoes, does that actually outweigh the grip where a minute on the sleds can cook you? It does not.\" *(Source: YouTube carbon plate Hyrox analysis)*\n- **Exception:** The Saucony Endorphin Pro 4 and Puma Deviate Nitro Elite occupy a middle ground \u2014 they have carbon/nylon plates but also better outsole coverage and stability. These are used by elite athletes who understand the tradeoff. The AI coach should **never** recommend Vaporfly or Alphafly but may cautiously recommend Deviate Nitro Elite or Endorphin Pro to advanced athletes who have tested them.\n\n**\u274c Minimalist/Barefoot Shoes (Vibram FiveFingers, Xero Shoes, Vivobarefoot)**\n- Zero cushioning for 8km of running on hard convention center floors = high impact stress, metatarsal pain\n- No support structure = injury risk under loaded movements (sled push at 102-202kg)\n- No grip features designed for sled turf\n- **Training note:** One Hyrox athlete actually trained 60 days in Vivobarefoot shoes to build foot strength, then raced in carbon-plated shoes \u2014 seeing significant performance improvement. Barefoot shoes have a role in *training*, not racing. *(Source: YouTube training video)*\n\n**\u274c Heavy Lifting Shoes (Nike Romaleos, Adidas Adipower, Reebok Legacy Lifter)**\n- Raised rigid heel designed for Olympic lifts = terrible for running\n- Very heavy (typically 400-500g+)\n- Rigid sole provides zero energy return for running\n- Elevated heel changes running biomechanics dangerously over 8km\n- No shock absorption\n\n**\u274c Old/Worn-Out Shoes**\n- Compressed midsole = reduced cushioning and energy return\n- Worn outsole = dramatically reduced grip on sled surfaces\n- Stretched upper = reduced lateral support and heel lockdown\n- As a general rule: if you can see smooth patches on your outsole, the shoe has lost meaningful grip\n\n**\u274c Trail Running Shoes (Salomon Speedcross, Hoka Speedgoat, etc.)**\n- Aggressive lugs designed for mud/dirt = unnecessary on indoor surfaces and can feel unstable on flat floors\n- Typically heavier than road shoes\n- Rock plates and aggressive tread patterns reduce flexibility for lunges and squats\n- Often have higher stack heights designed for uneven terrain\n\n---\n\n## 2. RACE DAY GEAR\n\n### 2.1 Official Hyrox Rules \u2014 Equipment (Season 2025/2026)\n\n**Source:** HYROX EN Single Rulebook 25/26, directly from hyrox.com\n\n#### Permitted Items (Section 11.1):\nThe following may be used/worn during the race:\n1. Knee Sleeves\n2. **Gloves (not grips)** \u2014 Note the distinction: gloves are permitted, grips are NOT\n3. Weightlifting Belt\n4. Wristbands\n5. Hydration Packs\n6. Asthma inhalers or similar prescribed respiratory devices\n7. **Closed-toe shoes required at all times** \u2014 except at Wall Balls where racers may remove shoes\n\n**Critical rule:** *\"If a racer chooses to use, wear or carry any of the above items, they must do so from the start to the finish of their race. These items may not be handed to or received from anyone else at any point. Doing so constitutes outside assistance and may result in disqualification.\"*\n\n**Also critical:** *\"Any item NOT listed above should be considered prohibited unless the racer receives written permission from the Race Director prior to race start.\"*\n\n#### Forbidden Items (Section 11.2):\n1. Headphones\n2. Cell Phones (exception: medical devices requiring phone proximity, with prior Race Director approval)\n3. VR Headsets\n4. GoPro or any type/brand of body cameras\n5. Helmets\n6. Breathing apparatus\n7. Compressed air cylinders\n\n#### Equipment at Stations:\n**All station equipment is provided by Hyrox.** Athletes do NOT bring their own:\n- SkiErg machines (preset to Resistance 6, adjustable by racer)\n- Sleds and weight plates\n- Rowing machines (preset to Resistance 6, footplates preset to Position 4, both adjustable)\n- Kettlebells (color-coded by weight/division: White=16kg, Grey=24kg, Black=32kg)\n- Sandbags (color-coded: White=10kg, Grey=20kg, Black=30kg)\n- Wall balls (color-coded: White=4kg, Grey=6kg, Black=9kg)\n- Burpee broad jump lanes\n\n**Athletes are assigned equipment/lanes by judges.** You cannot choose your own lane, sled, rower, or wall ball station. *(Section 9, rulebook)*\n\n#### Chalk Rules (VERY SPECIFIC \u2014 Section 8.1, Rule 8 + Penalty Code 16):\n- *\"Only event-provided chalk may be used, and only at the workout stations where it is provided.\"*\n- Chalk may NOT be taken to other workout stations or used at different stations\n- **Using chalk anywhere but Sled Pull and Farmers Carry = 2-minute penalty per infringement**\n- Using powdered chalk at Wall Balls specifically = 2-minute penalty\n- **You CANNOT bring your own chalk** (it is not on the \"permitted items\" list, and any unlisted item is prohibited by default)\n- At the 2025 World Championships in Chicago, the event ran out of chalk for some athletes *(Source: The Rox Guys)*\n\n#### Hydration/Nutrition Rules (Section 11.5):\n- Water available at aid stations at least once during, before, or after each pass through the Roxzone (you pass through ~8 times)\n- Sports drinks may also be available\n- **Any racer who wants nutrition (gels, etc.) must carry it on their person from the start**\n- Racers may NOT receive beverages or nutrition from anyone except aid stations (= outside assistance, 3-minute penalty per infringement)\n- Aid station fluids are **for drinking only** \u2014 pouring water on head/body for cooling = 2-minute penalty\n- **Hydration packs are permitted** (listed in Section 11.1)\n\n#### Jump Rope?\n- NOT listed as a permitted item, and NOT relevant \u2014 there is no jump rope station in Hyrox\n\n### 2.2 Gloves\n\n**Do experienced athletes use gloves?**\n\nThis is an evolving topic in the Hyrox community. Historically, most elite athletes used chalk or bare hands. However, lightweight purpose-built Hyrox gloves are gaining traction.\n\n**The case FOR gloves:**\n- Eliminates the \"chalk penalty\" \u2014 The Rox Guys calculated that stopping to apply chalk before 3+ stations costs ~22.5 seconds per race (3 stations \u00d7 7.5 seconds/station). That's a meaningful amount of time, especially at elite levels. *(Source: The Rox Guys data analysis)*\n- Consistent grip regardless of chalk availability \u2014 chalk ran out at the 2025 World Championships\n- No transition friction \u2014 put them on at the start, don't think about them again\n- Reduce mental load \u2014 \"remove that entire stream of worry\" about grip slipping *(Source: The Rox Guys)*\n- Protect hands from shared equipment used by thousands of athletes over a race weekend\n- Cushion during burpees (palm contact with ground)\n- Permitted by the rulebook (Section 11.1: \"Gloves (not grips)\")\n\n**The case AGAINST gloves:**\n- Bulky weightlifting gloves are too hot and padded, reducing tactile feedback\n- Can bunch up or shift during wall ball catches\n- Traditional gym gloves cover the wrist, interfering with watch/heart rate monitor\n- Some athletes feel they reduce the \"connection\" to the equipment\n\n**Best glove characteristics for Hyrox:**\n- **Lightweight and breathable** \u2014 not traditional bulky weightlifting gloves\n- **Minimal padding** \u2014 the goal is consistent grip, not hand cushioning\n- **Open wrist design** \u2014 to accommodate fitness trackers/watches\n- **Fingerless or thin full-finger** \u2014 some athletes prefer fingerless for wall ball feel\n- Purpose-built Hyrox gloves (e.g., The Rox Guys gloves) are designed for these specific needs\n\n**Recommended approach:**\n- Off-season / training: Go bare-handed or use chalk to build raw grip strength\n- Pre-competition / race day: Use lightweight performance gloves you've trained in *(Source: The Rox Guys strategic approach)*\n- **Never race in gloves you haven't trained in**\n\n**Stations where gloves help most:**\n1. Sled Pull (rope grip under sweaty conditions)\n2. Farmers Carry (200m with heavy kettlebells \u2014 grip endurance)\n3. Wall Balls (catching sweaty ball after 100 reps)\n4. SkiErg (handle grip under fatigue)\n5. Rowing (handle grip)\n\n### 2.3 Chalk\n\n**Is chalk allowed?** Yes, but with strict limitations:\n- **Only event-provided chalk** \u2014 you cannot bring your own (it's not on the permitted items list)\n- **Only at stations where it is provided** \u2014 Sled Pull and Farmers Carry\n- Using chalk at any other station (including Wall Balls) = **2-minute penalty**\n- You may NOT take chalk from one station to another\n\n**Practical implications:**\n- Chalk is provided in a communal bucket/bowl before Sled Pull and Farmers Carry stations\n- Application takes ~7-8 seconds per station (approach bucket, apply, rub hands)\n- Chalk can run out during busy race weekends (confirmed at 2025 Worlds)\n- Liquid chalk is NOT mentioned as permitted \u2014 the rule says \"event-provided chalk\" only\n- If your race strategy depends on chalk, you have a single point of failure\n\n**Which stations benefit from chalk?**\n- Sled Pull \u2014 primary grip challenge; rope can be slippery from sweat and prior use\n- Farmers Carry \u2014 supporting 16-32kg per hand for 200m; grip endurance is critical\n- SkiErg and Rowing also benefit from grip, but chalk is NOT permitted at these stations\n\n### 2.4 Weightlifting Belt\n\n**Should you wear a weightlifting belt for Hyrox?**\n\n**Generally: NO.**\n\nRationale:\n- A standard 4-inch weightlifting belt restricts diaphragmatic breathing, which is critical during 8km of running at elevated heart rate\n- No Hyrox station involves the kind of maximal spinal loading that truly requires belt support:\n  - Sled push/pull: Horizontal force, not axial spinal load\n  - Farmers Carry: Heavy but submaximal grip challenge, not spinal compression\n  - Sandbag Lunges: 10-30kg sandbag on shoulders \u2014 significant but not belt-territory weight\n  - Wall Balls: 4-9kg ball, 100 reps \u2014 muscular endurance, not maximal load\n  - SkiErg/Rowing: Upper body pulling \u2014 belt not relevant\n  - Burpee Broad Jumps: Bodyweight movement\n- Belt must be worn from start to finish per rulebook rules (Section 11.1 \u2014 items \"must do so from the start to the finish of their race\")\n- The breathing restriction over 60-120 minutes would likely cost more performance than any stabilization benefit\n\n**Rare exception:** An athlete with a specific diagnosed back condition (e.g., herniated disc, spondylolisthesis) who has been medically advised to wear a belt during loaded exercise. In this case, use the thinnest possible belt and accept the breathing tradeoff.\n\n### 2.5 Other Race Day Gear\n\n#### Race Belt / Bib\n- A race number belt (elastic belt with clips to hold your bib) eliminates the need for safety pins through your shirt\n- Prevents bib from bouncing/flapping during running\n- Allows you to reposition bib easily\n- Widely used and recommended \u2014 inexpensive ($10-$20) and highly practical\n- Note: Bib must be visible and wristband must be worn visibly\n\n#### Hydration\n- **Water stations** are available at least once during/before/after each Roxzone pass (effectively ~8 opportunities throughout the race)\n- Cups at water stations provide ~100-150ml each *(Source: VOOM Nutrition)*\n- **Hydration packs are permitted** (rulebook Section 11.1) \u2014 but must be worn from start to finish\n- **Soft flasks** tucked into shorts/belt are popular \u2014 more practical than a full vest\n- For races <75 min: Aid station water is typically sufficient\n- For races 75min-2hr: Consider a 500ml soft flask with electrolyte solution\n- For races >2hr: Strongly consider carrying hydration *(Source: Precision Hydration)*\n- **Important:** Pouring water over your head/body is PROHIBITED (2-minute penalty) \u2014 fluids are for drinking only\n\n#### Nutrition\n- Must be carried on your person from the start \u2014 cannot receive food/drink from spectators\n- Energy gels are the most common choice \u2014 test in training first\n- Carry 1-2 gels for mid-race consumption during run segments or less intense transitions\n- Aim for 30-60g carbs per hour for races >75 min *(Source: Precision Hydration)*\n\n#### Headband / Sweatband\n- Convention center venues are heated, often with limited airflow \u2014 temperatures can be very high\n- Sweatbands prevent sweat from dripping into eyes (especially problematic during wall balls when looking up)\n- Lightweight and practical \u2014 widely used\n- Not listed as restricted in the rulebook\n\n#### Compression Gear\n- **Evidence is mixed but generally positive for perception of recovery and comfort.** A 2016 study in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found enhanced recovery of muscle strength and reduced DOMS. Research in the International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance suggested compression can improve running economy. *(Source: WaveWear citing peer-reviewed studies)*\n- Multiple Hyrox-focused articles promote compression for reduced muscle vibration, enhanced proprioception, and improved venous return between stations\n- **Practical reality:** Many athletes wear compression shorts/tights for comfort and chafe prevention regardless of performance benefits\n- **Recommendation:** If you like compression gear, wear it. There's no meaningful downside. The performance benefits are likely small but non-zero. Don't buy it expecting a breakthrough \u2014 buy it if it's comfortable.\n\n#### Watch / Heart Rate Monitor\n- Permitted (not on the forbidden items list)\n- Useful for: pacing run segments, monitoring heart rate to avoid going anaerobic early, tracking total time, counting laps\n- **GPS will not work indoors** \u2014 use a watch that also tracks heart rate via optical sensor\n- Ensure the watch fits under any gloves you're wearing\n- Popular choices in the Resilience Fitness survey: Garmin and Apple Watch were most common; some athletes use a training-specific watch (Garmin/Coros) rather than their everyday Apple Watch *(Source: Resilience Fitness Gear Guide 2025)*\n- Lap counter function is valuable \u2014 losing track of running laps is a common mistake that leads to 3-7 minute penalties *(Source: multiple race mistake articles)*\n\n#### Knee Sleeves\n- Permitted (rulebook Section 11.1)\n- Can provide warmth and mild compression for the knee joint during lunges, wall balls, and burpee broad jumps\n- Many athletes use them; personal preference\n- Must be worn from start to finish\n\n---\n\n## 3. WHAT EXPERIENCED ATHLETES ACTUALLY BRING\n\n### 3.1 The Minimal Race Kit\n\nBased on surveys, race guides, and athlete reports from multiple sources (Wheelhouse Academy, Resilience Fitness, RoxLyfe, No Excuses CrossFit, Centr):\n\n#### ON YOUR BODY (race start):\n1. \u2705 **Shoes** \u2014 broken in, tested on sleds, comfortable for 8km+\n2. \u2705 **Socks** \u2014 moisture-wicking, tested in training (blister prevention is critical). Feetures and Nike were popular in surveys\n3. \u2705 **Shorts** \u2014 lightweight, moisture-wicking, compression-lined recommended (prevents chafing). Some athletes prefer short tights/compression shorts\n4. \u2705 **Top** \u2014 lightweight tank or short-sleeve technical tee. **Avoid cotton.** Convention centers are hot \u2014 less is more\n5. \u2705 **Race bib** \u2014 on race belt or pinned to front\n6. \u2705 **Timing chip** \u2014 on ankle (received at check-in, mandatory)\n7. \u2705 **Wristband** \u2014 from check-in (indicates division/wave, mandatory)\n8. \u2705 **Watch** \u2014 for pacing, heart rate, and lap counting\n9. \u2705 **Gloves** (optional) \u2014 if trained with them\n10. \u2705 **Nutrition** \u2014 1-2 gels tucked in waistband or shorts pocket\n11. \u2705 **Hydration** (optional) \u2014 soft flask if race will be 75+ minutes\n\n#### IN YOUR DROP BAG / BACKPACK:\n1. \u2705 Change of clothes (including underwear and socks)\n2. \u2705 Flip-flops or recovery slides\n3. \u2705 Towel\n4. \u2705 Body wipes / deodorant\n5. \u2705 Protein bar or recovery snack\n6. \u2705 Phone charger / power bank\n7. \u2705 Reusable water bottle (for pre/post race hydration)\n8. \u2705 Plastic bag for sweaty clothes\n9. \u2705 Government-issued photo ID (required for check-in)\n10. \u2705 Registration confirmation\n\n#### WARM-UP TOOLS (optional but recommended):\n1. \u2705 Lacrosse ball (calves, glutes, traps)\n2. \u2705 Small foam roller\n3. \u2705 Mini resistance bands (for glute/shoulder activation)\n\n### 3.2 Common Mistakes\n\n**\u274c Overdressing**\n- Convention centers are heated indoor venues with limited ventilation\n- Thousands of athletes generate enormous body heat\n- Long sleeves, multiple layers, heavy fabrics = overheating, energy waste\n- Ideal kit: shorts + lightweight technical tank/tee\n- *\"Think thin shorts, light top, maybe a sweatband\"* *(Source: Hyrox race day checklist video)*\n\n**\u274c Wearing Brand-New Untested Shoes**\n- The #1 gear mistake repeatedly cited across all sources\n- *\"Wear the shoes you've trained in, ones you already know feel stable during sled work and comfortable during running intervals. Breaking in new shoes on race day can lead to blisters, bruises, or worse, a distracted mindset.\"* *(Source: Wheelhouse Academy)*\n- Break in any new shoes **at least 3-4 workouts prior** to race day\n- Test shoes on a heavy sled push \u2014 if your feet slip, the shoe fails the Hyrox test\n\n**\u274c Bringing Too Much Gear**\n- You cannot access your bag during the race\n- Everything you need must be on your body from start to finish\n- Keep it simple: shoes, clothes, watch, maybe gloves, nutrition, hydration\n- Leave the foam roller, massage gun, extra shoes, etc. in your bag\n\n**\u274c Forgetting Nutrition/Hydration**\n- Many athletes assume the water stations will be sufficient and forget to plan nutrition\n- Must carry nutrition from the start \u2014 cannot receive it during the race\n- Test gels and hydration in training \u2014 \"Race day is not the time to experiment\" *(Source: SugarWOD, Precision Hydration, RoxLyfe)*\n- Some athletes report GI distress from untested gels mid-race\n\n**\u274c Not Having Anti-Chafe Protection**\n- 8km of running + loaded lunges + rowing = significant friction on inner thighs, underarms, nipples\n- Apply body glide or similar anti-chafe product before the race\n- Compression shorts help prevent inner thigh chafing\n\n**\u274c Arriving Late**\n- Check-in requires photo ID and registration confirmation\n- You receive your timing chip, bib, and wristband at check-in\n- Recommended: **Arrive 90 minutes early** *(Source: Centr)*\n- You need time for: check-in \u2192 bag drop \u2192 warm-up \u2192 start zone assembly (10 min before wave start)\n\n**\u274c Relying on Chalk Being Available**\n- Chalk is only provided at Sled Pull and Farmers Carry\n- It can run out during busy events\n- If grip is a concern, consider gloves as a backup strategy\n- You CANNOT bring your own chalk\n\n---\n\n## Source Summary\n\n| Source | Type | Key Contribution |\n|---|---|---|\n| HYROX Rulebook 25/26 (Singles) | Official rules | Equipment rules, chalk rules, penalties, station standards |\n| RoxLyfe | Expert athlete guide | Elite athlete shoe choices, shoe analysis, common mistakes |\n| RunRepeat Hyrox Shoe Guide | Lab-tested shoe reviews | Stack heights, grip scores, energy return data, stability ratings |\n| Muscle & Fitness | Tested shoe reviews | Real-world shoe performance at Hyrox stations |\n| Men's Health UK | Expert shoe guide | Carbon plate analysis, shoe recommendations by type |\n| Resilience Fitness Gear Guide 2025 | Community survey (45 athletes) | Real athlete shoe/sock/apparel preferences |\n| The Rox Guys | Athlete/brand analysis | Glove vs. chalk data, grip time cost analysis |\n| Centr (Hyrox partner) | Official Hyrox partner content | Equipment checklist, hydration science, shoe specs |\n| Precision Hydration | Nutrition experts | Hydration strategy, fueling by race duration |\n| Wheelhouse Academy | Coaching resource | Race day essentials checklist |\n| Hoogkamer et al.
