          "snippet": "We are now entering Week 1 of the CrossFit Open and this will mark the start of our Transition Phase. We will use the 3 Week CrossFit Open as our Transition phase in order to help us set the week up in a way that allows for more consistent structure week to week with the goal of front loading the week with our Strength progressions and then having the later half of the week set-up to align with the focus of tackling the Open workout at full intensity as a true test of fitness. Our weekend workouts will be similar in structure to what we have seen over the course of the last cycle with Sunday leaning into a little more strength work as well in order to keep our programming well rounded.\n\n**Programming Approach: **\n\nOur powerlifting work will follow a 5-3-1 style progression with a primary focus on maintaining strength in this critical rep range. This will serve as the basis for our strength progressions with some specific strength EMOMs that will serve as extra hypertrophy, stability, and bulletproofing for the body. This style will serve to help build a well rounded body that can handle the more loads and volume later down the line into the Months of May, June, and July.\n\nOur weightlifting work will focus on maintaining top end strength and technical confidence, while also working on complexes to not only hone technique, but also build familiarity for the ~3 rep max or ladder work. This will help us progress the lifts from the previous cycles where we were targeting more hang positional work as well as the Power variations of the lifts for greater rep ranges in the Artemis Cycle. This work will be blended in an alternated weekly to keep the frequency there, while having a greater focus on our Powerlifting and strength stability work.\n\nFor our gymnastics work, we will be circling around to more strict strength development, placing strict strength gymnastics progressions in as a strong foundational build that will serve us well as we move into Murph Prep towards the end of this cycle and into the beginning of our next cycle. We will continue to build in the high skill gymnastics work and skill progressions, but the emphasis for modifications on those days will lean more towards strength development as well.\n\nLastly, when it comes to our conditioning work, we will be focused on targeting a well balanced programming that limits biased work with the goal of hitting one workout a week that targets the 7-11min Time Domain, one workout that targets the 11-15min Time Domain, and one workout that targets the 20+ minute time domain, with the others placed in as interval workout variations or EMOMs to target capacity and muscular endurance.\n\n**Programming Goals:**\n\n\u2013 1RM Back Squat, 1RM Strict Press, 1RM Deadlift\n\n\u2013 Confidence and Consistency at 90% and higher for the Snatch, Clean, and Jerk\n\n\u2013 Strict Gymnastics Strength Development Work / Isometrics\n\n\u2013 Unilateral Upper and Lower Body Strength Work\n\n\u2013 The Weekly Strength and Stability EMOM\n\n### What to Expect This Week:\n\n- Monday: Back Squat 5RM and a 15:00 Grind of an AMRAP.\n\n- Tuesday: Ring Muscle-Ups Skills + Practice into a Burner of an EMOM centered around midline and quad stamina.\n\n- Wednesday: Touch and Go 5RM Power Clean some barbell cycling fun!\n\n- Thursday: Mix Modal Endurance Based workout as a little active flush before our Open Workout Friday\n\n- Friday: Open 25.1 from 4pm programmed classes in the monring\n\n- Saturday: Member of the month WOD (LIAM)\n\n- Sunday: Strength Focused EMOM, that gives us a glimpse and feel into some EMOMs to come in our next cycle.\n\nThis week will finish off our testing phase for the Artemis Cycle, have us tackle 25.1 on either Friday or Saturday and help us transition and set-up our upcoming \u2018Poseidon\u2019 Cycle.\n\n",

He certainly had a lot of endorsements and prize money to last him.\n\nInstead, he decided to grace the world with his take on CrossFit training, creating a program, HWPO (\u201cHard Work Pays Off\u201d) that can be had for $40 a month.\n\nI followed HWPO\u2019s Flagship program pretty closely for roughly 18 months and feel as though I have a pretty good grasp on what the training is all about.\n\nHere is my HWPO programming review (as well as my wife\u2019s experience with HWPO 60) and my thoughts on how it may or may not be\n\n*the* program for other CrossFitters.\n\nTLDR: It is a pretty good CrossFit training program\u2026but I\n\n*much* prefer (both the program itself and my results) Sentinel Training.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n## Program Structure\n\nThe HWPO programming structure is unique (to me at least) in the manner in which each workout is scheduled. Rather than simply dropping you in to wherever a particular program is at the current moment (Ex. Comptrain), there is a definite \u201cDay 1\u201d, \u201cDay 100\u201d, \u201cDay 400\u201d and on. You\u2019ll start with the same workouts everybody else has started with and work through the same cycles whether you jump in early January, April, or October.\n\n(that year, there was a \u201cOpen Prep\u201d option added for those looking to prep for the upcoming open, but this was programming split off from the \u201cFlagship\u201d track).\n\nI like this structure and think that it gets all participants \u201cup to speed\u201d with the program\u2019s overall structure as well as those of each workout. Even advanced athletes would likely struggle if they randomly dropped into \u201cDay 273\u201d of the program due to relatively intense nature of the workouts. The first few program weeks do an excellent job of preparing athletes for the rigors to come.\n\nFraser has programmed a number of cycles and \u201cwaves\u201d into the program, most notably those involving squats, Olympic lifts and rowing\u2026yeah\u2026rowing.\n\nYou do\n\n*a lot *of rowing the HWPO training program! Mal O\u2019Brien can confirm!\n\nThere is obviously a method to this and I can attest that my strength and rowing\n\n*endurance *levels (I still needed a bit of technique work!) have gotten better (and probably better than they *would *have gotten with other, general programming) with HWPO programming.\n\nThere are 5 \u201cnormal\u201d training days each week. One day is a full rest day while another day involves much shorter and \u201clighter\u201d activity (ex. spin bike, light swimming).\n\n## Workout Structure \u2013 HWPO Flagship vs. HWPO 60\n\nNow that I have experience with multiple HWPO training programs, I will split this section up to discuss each in detail.\n\n### HWPO Flagship\n\nWorkouts in the Flagship program take on a pretty consistent pattern. A decently intense active warm-up (with movements somewhat mimicking the exercises) starts things off followed by strength pieces. Without fail, squats and front squats are programmed twice a week and deadlifts and bench press each once a week. Olympic lifts are generally performed three days each week with the volume and variety differing depending on the cycle.\n\nThe overall volume and rep counts differ greatly here, but you can expect to perform between 10 and 22-25 working sets during this portion. All of the weights for these sets are based off of 1RM percentages.\n\nAfter the strength piece there is some kind of cardio element, whether in the form of a classic metcon, a dedicated rowing piece, or a dedicated Assault Bike/Echo Bike piece. These generally last between 12 and 20 minutes.\n\nAccessory work and \u201cBonus work\u201d close out each workout. While the bonus content is not always present, accessory work\n\n*always *is. Interestingly enough, these portions vary *greatly *in length and intensity. Some days, a few sets of GHD-machine back extensions are programmed. Other times, you might find something like\u2026this\u2026\n\nThe length of HWPO training workouts has been discussed at length before and, truth be told, the workouts can go\n\n*pretty *long. I generally keep my rest periods between 2 and 3 minutes during the strength pieces and still end up hitting my self-imposed 1:50 workout \u201ctime cap\u201d about 70 percent of the time.\n\nI know others rest less than I do during these pieces, but I don\u2019t rest very long between pieces. As such, I don\u2019t know who can reasonably expect to consistently get through these workouts in less than 1:45. If you\u2019re not particularly \u201cfast\u201d, expect to make some cuts to each workout.\n\n### HWPO 60\n\nRecently, my wife started the \u201cHWPO 60\u201d program\u2026and is\n\n*loving *it. After bouncing around between HWPO Flagship (we started at the same time, although she switched programs after about 10 months) and Street Parking (and one\u2026less-than-enjoyable day of PRVN) she decided to re-join the HWPO \u201cfamily\u201d!\n\nAlthough it has been quite a while since she started HWPO Flagship, via careful notes she kept, she is able to compare the early days of the program to the first week of HWPO. Essentially, the program content are very,\n\n*very *similar.\n\n**The main difference**? On most days of HWPO 60, either a strength piece or an accessory piece (sometimes multiple accessory pieces) is removed from the HWPO Flagship program. More rarely, the metcon or rowing piece is anywhere between 25 and 33 percent shorter and/or the percentages for strength workouts are slightly lighter.\n\nOther than that, the programs are the same. My wife has never clocked a longer than 70 minutes in an HWPO 60 workout (completing\n\n*all* pieces *and *accounting for warm-up and clean-up time) yet still feels as though she is getting a *complete* training experience.\n\n## Intensity\n\nThere are definitely intensity waves programmed into the HWPO programming, but\n\n*everything *feels pretty intense to me most of the time. Even the standard 40-minute EMOM (usually scheduled for Saturday or Sunday) generally has one or two elements that up the ante.\n\nThat being said, there is always a \u201cheavy\u201d squat day and a \u201clight\u2026ish\u201d squat day each week. During many of the high-intensity metcons, there are built-in break periods to force you to take your foot off of the gas for a bit.\n\nThese forced breaks, while giving you a brief respite from the WOD\u2019s rigors, actually work to\n\n*increase *the overall intensity. In contrast to a 20-minute AMRAP that you might \u201cget lost\u201d in the middle of, 4, 2-minute AMRAPs with 1-minute rest periods between them forces you to *really *give it your all in each work window.\n\n## Equipment Needs\n\nHWPO programming assumes you have access to a good amount of equipment to include barbells, bumpers, dumbbells, kettlebells, GHD, rower, fan bike, ski erg, spin bike, weighted vest, bench, pull-up rig, rings, rope, sandbag\u2026probably some other stuff, too, but you get the point.\n\nYou can modify a lot of the movements (and if you listen to Fraser\u2019s detailed, 10-15-minute explanations before each workout, he\u2019ll mention these modifications from time to time), but I think you\n\n*really *need most of this stuff to get the most benefit from the workouts and program.\n\nI didn\u2019t have a ski erg or a spin bike (although I did have a dinky, cheap upright bike) so would generally sub some other type of cardio machine out for these items. The ski erg hadn\u2019t become\n\n*that* popular (yet) so I didn\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve missed out too much on something vital.\n\n## Community\n\nIn addition to all of the programming and videos from Fraser discussing workouts and movements, there is a dedicated HWPO Circle community for all paid members.\n\nThis community functions kind of like a subreddit community or Facebook group with members discussing their workouts, asking questions, and soliciting form feedback. Generally, form-related videos receive almost instant feedback from other HWPO members. There are also HWPO staff coaches who closely monitor the groups who are quick to provide feedback.\n\nThe Circle group is probably\n\n*most* valuable for the garage or basement gym HWPO athletes who desire more of a community setting or for those who don\u2019t have access to eyes-on coaching. It is no substitute for immediate, in-person feedback, but it is definitely the next best thing!\n\n## \u201cWho is HWPO Flagship\n\n*Truly *Designed For?\u201d\n\n\u201cIntensity\u201d and \u201cdifficulty\u201d are not always mutually inclusive concepts, but with HWPO training, I feel as though there is a\n\n*bit *of overlap. I oftentimes felt myself wondering \u201cwho the heck is this program *truly *designed for?!\u201d I say this by thinking about my own capability in relation to those of the general CrossFit population.\n\nThe last couple of years, I have messed around with the CrossFit Open workouts. I have always gone hard when performing them, but haven\u2019t re-tested any of them and haven\u2019t altered my training to accommodate them. When the dust has cleared, I would have easily qualified for the Age-Group Quarterfinals and possibly even for the overall QFs.\n\nThat being said, I find myself scaling weights or movements during the HWPO metcons and cardio pieces between\n\n**60 and 70 percent of the time**.\n\nI am obviously not an elite athlete, but the top dogs are getting (good) individualized coaching and programming.\n\n\u2026so, again\u2026\u201dwho the heck is this program designed for?!\u201d\n\nThere is definitely a gap between my ability level and the\n\n*near *top-level athletes who HWPO Flagship is probably *perfect *for. Not much scaling of weights or exercises\u2026the *perfect *level of intensity and challenge.\n\nHowever, I feel like this gap can\u2019t be\n\n*that *big and that most people running the program are scaling as much, if not more often than I am.\n\nThis isn\u2019t even taking into account the long workout durations. If I didn\u2019t work from home, if I had kids, etc. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d fit it all in, seeing that I have to time cap myself anyways (I\u2019d probably\n\n*have* to go with HWPO 60)!\n\nIf you\u2019re willing to humble yourself and use some discretion to scale workouts and to focus your attention on areas you need the most work on, you can\n\n*definitely *benefit from the Flagship or HWPO 60 programs.\n\n## Personal Results\n\nI took the plunge into HWPO programming in February of 2022 when I first moved into my new basement gym. I had been doing some less-than-ideal and unorganized \u201cself-programming\u201d (sic) for close to a year in the old garage cube and was a bit out of shape.\n\nThe \u201con-boarding\u201d weeks were perfect for me and I quickly re-gained much of my previous conditioning while also quickly growing accustomed to the program\u2019s structure.\n\nIn a little over a year\u2019s time, I set PRs in almost all of the program\u2019s barbell movements (squat, front squat, deadlift, power snatch, snatch, strict press) with the clean and jerk being the notable exceptions (I have personal issues with these lifts that I need to get sorted with eyes-on coaching!) Additionally, my rowing and Assault Bike capabilities\n\nShortly before taking my break from HWPO, I re-tested CrossFit Open WOD 20.1\u2026the infamous 10 rounds of snatches and bar-facing burpees. I had been doing HWPO for\n\n*just *under a year at this point.\n\nWhen I originally did this back in late 2019, I got time capped. My second attempt improved my time to 14:47.\n\nMy most recent time (post-HWPO training)? 14:05\u2026a roughly 5 percent improvement.\n\nMaybe not the\n\n*most *impressive improvement example, but I was satisfied.\n\n## Conclusion/Suggestion\n\nIt\u2019s hard to argue with the CrossFit GOAT about what works\u2026but I think he knows more about what works for\n\n*him* than it does for the masses.\n\nNot everyone is going to have the time to devote to HWPO Flagship workouts, the requisite equipment, the humility to scale (\n\n*a lot *in some cases), or the desire to do intense workouts day-in and day-out.\n\nA lot of people are also probably going to want programming that is a bit more\u2026interesting\u2026and productive.\n\nHWPO wasn\u2019t\n\n*bad*, but man\u2026I wish I had been doing Sentinel for at least part of the time that I spent \u201cworking with Fraser\u201d\u2026\n\n",

Most don't need or want sport-specific skills with narrow real-world utility.\n\nWe don't program complex gymnastic movements for this reason.\n\nThe reality of your member\u2019s lives demands strength, endurance, and capacity. It doesn't require them to know how to walk on their hands.\n\n**We program for members who want to train smart**\n\nYour members want to be your members forever. They don\u2019t want to get beat up and spit out. They don't want to keep searching. They want a training program they can do consistently, and that works.\n\nIntensity drives results, but when structured poorly and without intelligent controls around volume, it can become the barrier to progress instead of the main driver..\n\nWe implement what we call \u201cintentional intensity\u201d through movement pairings, loading, & rep shemes that fall into our programming sweet spot for sustainable power output.\n\nThis allows your coaches and therefore your members to maximize their training efficiency while preventing overtraining and ensuring sustainable progress.\n\nThe result: Your members will build up, not burn out.\n\n**We program running as a cornerstone. **\n\nTraveling efficiently from one point to another is as functional as it gets. Because it's one of the most fundamental movements your members will ever do, they need repeated, consistent exposure to it.\n\nThis is why your programming will include running 2-3 times a week at varying intensities and distances. Your members\u2019 fitness will be grounded in this natural human movement.\n\n**We program with proven methods and are always adapting**\n\nJust as you are committed to improving your gym for the long-term benefit of your members, we're committed to improving our offering for the long-term benefit of our partner gyms.\n\nWe promise to adapt, refine, and elevate our programming over time.

Expect NEW MOVEMENTS from any stage of the competition to appear in FLAGSHIP 2.0.\n\nHWPO FLAGSHIP was our original track designed by Mat Fraser based on his own training experience. All new members started on DAY 1 of training, just like Mat did, but he was alone. Mat has since learned that he\u2019s most successful when surrounded by a community training with him. FLAGSHIP 2.0 delivers this realization\u2013all HARD WORKERS now follow the same training on the same day. Benefit from better coaching support, real-time leaderboards, and, most importantly, sharing your fitness journey with a like-minded community that is equally dedicated to SHOWING UP and WORKING HARD.\n\nEach day starts with a coaching video from Mat Fraser or one of our world-class coaches to ensure you are hitting the proper intent and stimulus. The structure of each session includes an intentional warm up, targeted strength progressions with strength accessory work, gymnastics progressions, a metcon or monostructural conditioning such as rowing, running or swimming, and accessories. Occasionally, there is a bonus/extra workout that would require additional time if you choose to complete it.\n\nHWPO FLAGSHIP 2.0 requires around 2 hours per day to complete, 6 days per week. If you\u2019re limited on time you can switch to FLAGSHIP 60 to be in and out the gym in about an hour.

He's previously shared six tough #HWPO workouts, as well as his experience taking Rogue's \"Cliffhanger\" Challenge on his channel. His latest training session comes from Week 2 of his 12 week #HWPO Program.\n\n\"The focus is on lighter weight, higher volume,\" says Fraser. He also posted about the workout on his Instagram.\n\nHere's what you can expect if you want to try to take on Fraser's split.

All the power should be generated from the legs.\"\n\n**Strict Press**\n\n4 sets of 10 reps at 90 percent of 10RM\n\n\"This is more volume but taking the legs out of the equations,\" says Fraser. \"Now we're using our shoulders to press the weight up.

          "snippet": "Based on the training Mat Fraser used in his years of competition, this program has evolved with the lessons he\u2019s learned since stepping off the floor. PRO is a progression-based system designed to develop athletes and prepare them for competition \u2014 whether you\u2019re chasing elite podiums or competing within your MASTERS division.\n\nTrack variations allow athletes to switch between OFF SEASON and COMP PREP phases to align with individual goals, while the MASTERS track provides a dedicated path tailored to the unique demands, timelines, and recovery needs of Masters athletes.\nAccess to a fully equipped gym and additional training facilities, such as a track and a pool, is required. Two sessions a day, each lasting 2\u20133 hours of training. High-volume programming for dedicated professionals, with NO MODIFYING or SCALING.\n\n**HWPO PRO | off season**\n\nFollow our primary track outside of competition prep to maintain and develop your elite fitness. If you need to focus on a specific weakness or have personal goals you want to achieve, our track variations are thoughtfully designed to get you where you want to be.\n\n\u2026\n\nThis track will follow the same progressions as HWPO PRO with increased conditioning pieces. The coaching team will adjust the training order to allow for more energy availability in the conditioning sessions. This will target the athletes who generally struggle with the longer-time domain metcons at competitions. You can also expect a reduction in the intensity (drop in percentages) and volume of strength work to allow for the aerobic focus.\n**HWPO PRO | COMP PREP**\n\nWhen it's time to SHOW UP and COMPETE, we've got you. Switch from our standard OFF SEASON tracks when it's time to prepare, and you'll receive training tailored to get you competition-ready.\n\nTailored to the demands of your target event, ensuring you develop the strength, skill, and endurance required for success. The program progresses through key training phases, refining movement efficiency, dialing in competition pacing, and exposing you to event-style workouts.\n\n\u2026\n\nPRO MASTERS is a dedicated track built specifically for competitive MASTERS athletes. It follows the official Masters competition season, blending the structure and intensity of PRO with smart programming that enhances recovery, protects longevity, and sustains peak performance.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a lighter version of PRO \u2014 it\u2019s refined for where you are in your career. Training volume and intensity are thoughtfully adjusted, joint prep and mobility are prioritized, and movement progressions are tailored for continued strength and skill advancement.\n\n\u2026\n\nOFF SEASON builds the foundation, improving weaknesses, developing strength, and maintaining fitness between competition cycles. COMP PREP turns that work into game-day performance with higher intensity, structured progressions, and event-style sessions that replicate the demands of competition.\n\nMASTERS is a dedicated track that follows its own competition season, tailored specifically for Masters athletes. It mirrors the intent of PRO but with adjusted volume, recovery, and movement prep to support sustained performance, resilience, and longevity throughout the season.\n\n\u2026\n\n**PRO: MASTERS** follows a similar adjusted structure but is designed specifically for MASTERS athletes \u2014 balancing competitive performance with smarter recovery and sustainable progression across the season.\n\nAccess to a fully equipped gym is essential. For HWPO PRO, athletes will be expected to have out of gym sessions such as trail running, hill sprints, track sessions and swim workouts.",

          "snippet": "Proper progression is mastery of one level of development before proceeding to the next.\nPrinciple 1 states that we should first move well, then move often.\nSeek a qualitative minimum before we worry about quantities. If moving well is the standard, moving often is the foreseeable outcome.\nPrinciple 2 directs us to protect, correct, and develop the movement of those in our care.\n\n\u2026\n\nPrinciple 1 tells us to move well, then move often. I firmly believe this is the life lesson that nature teaches us; I see it in animals and those people who are the physically and spiritually healthiest. Principle 1 is our natural principle.\nWe should move well enough to respond and often enough to adapt. Moving well allows us to respond appropriately to environmental signals. It sets up the feedback that is vital for progressive movement learning. Moving often adds volume across time which allows our patterns and tissues to adapt.\nWe need to see movement for what it is\u2014the most distinguishable sign of life\u2014a true vital sign. If we look at the developmental model, we are born with mobility and earn stability. We transition from fundamental to functional movements. Even the most highly developed running and climbing skills have roots in our primal patterns.\nUnderstanding this amazing process is understanding that movement is driven through perception and behavior.\nMovement Principle 2: Protect, correct, and develop.\nIf we lack fundamental movements, the path to fitness and health does not begin with supplementary exercise. That is the paradigm that puts quantity before quality\u2014it attempts to build fitness on dysfunction\u2014it focuses on parts. The first principle has somehow been reversed\u2014people move often and hope that moving well will just happen. It won\u2019t. And movement problems will only get worse when compounded by frequency.\nThe solution is simple\u2014we need to quit lowering fitness standards. We can meet the old ones just fine if we raise movement standards. We also need to quit focusing on parts; reductionism, the breakdown of movement into isolated segments, has not reduced our musculoskeletal injuries nor has it made us healthier or more fit.\nPatterns and sequences remain the preferred mode of operation in biological organisms, and that is where our focus is.\nWhy does the first principle work? Why do we move? Because movement affords us opportunity. It is on the foundation of movement that development occurs through the SAID principle: Specific Adaptation to Imposed Demand.\nMoving well before moving often\u2014this order offers us the greatest exposure to opportunities and risk. Moving well before moving often also offers us the greatest adaptation to environment.\n\n\u2026\n\nNature is big and it can be harsh. Nature doesn\u2019t stop to wait for your adaptation and development and sometimes the lessons it teaches are not survivable. The second principle requires us to develop a non-failure environment.\nThe SAID Principle should never be used as the sole excuse to lift more weight, run faster, climb farther, swim harder or fight bigger opponents. That thinking puts more before better.\n\n\u2026\n\nProtect from opportunities that do not promote productive feedback and/or impose risk.\nCorrect feedback by magnifying misread obstacles within the learning path.\nDevelop progressions with rich sensory experience and clear, robust feedback to foster independence and productive self-regulation.\nYou do not move to the next level of development until you are competent and independent at your current level\u2014and can sustain it.\n\n\u2026\n\nPrinciple 3 is the practical principle.\nStandard operating procedures and intelligent selection protect those who entrust their health and fitness to us.\nBut where should a system start? It should recognize that we cannot know anything without perspective\u2014that we cannot progress without baselines. Earlier I mentioned movement as a vital sign of life, and along with blood pressure and body temperature and many others, it absolutely is.\nUnlike that long list, we currently have no baseline for understanding movement as a vital sign.\nIf we can have a system that looks at fundamental movement patterns, we can create a baseline.\nWith that baseline, we can identify and demonstrate the fundamental movements that are missing, deficient or dysfunctional. If movement is below a vital sign or ability\u2014that\u2019s dysfunction; below an environmental standard\u2014that\u2019s deficiency (necessary, but not sufficient). We can communicate these states to colleagues and medical professionals in a common language that, in itself, will enforce responsibility and accountability.",

We\u2019re talking three to four hours of training a day, six days a week.\n\n**HWPO** ** Classic **\n\nA community-based daily workout, rather than a progressive programme. Jump in, work hard, then go about your day.\n**HWPO** ** Sweat**\n\nFor anyone who wants to get a sweat on and see a nice level of progression. Minimal equipment needed, 45-minute sessions \u2013 AMRAP (as many rounds as possible) and EMOM (every minute on the minute) formats.\n\nThe following workout gives a sense of what you can expect from HWPO Sweat: a full-body muscle pump and cardio workout rolled into one.\n**HWPO Sweat Workout**\n\n**0:00-12:00 mins**\n\n**EMOM 12\n\n**\n\n1a.

Athletes looking to compete in the CrossFit Games season have no shortage of programs to follow these days. Programs like Mayhem Athlete, Misfit Athletics, CompTrain, Underdogs Athletics and Brute Strength send athletes under their camp to Games every year.\n\nNow add the HWPO PRO camp. But not everyone can join. In what we believe is the first of its kind, HWPO PRO has set certain requirements needed to join.\n\nSo what are the requirements?\n\n- Placed top 300 in Quarterfinals\n\n- Ability to train 2 sessions per day, 3-4 hours\n\n- 245/155 lb. Snatch\n\n- 275/185 lb. Clean & Jerk\n\n- 365/Upper 200\u2019s lb. Back Squat\n\n- 10+ Unbroken Ring Muscle-Ups\n\n- Proficient in Handstand Walking\n\n- Proficient in Butterfly & Chest-to-Bar Pull-ups\n\n- Access to all machines & equipment you expect to see in competition\n\n- Access to specialty equipment is also required such as axel bars, peg boards and various training implements such as a road bike, track and swimming pool\n\n- No modifications or scaling\n\nOn top of that, HWPO PRO can only be joined at certain times. Right now, registration is open from October 16-23, 2022. Once registration closes, the next opportunity to join is during the Open Season cycle.\n\nSo as you can see, HWPO PRO is for serious athletes only. There is no option to follow along and just scale or modify movements.\n\nHowever, if you are one a top 300 Quarterfinal athlete and want to train like Mat Fraser did, this could be the program. Plus, those in the program get access to six expert training staff members: Mat Fraser, Steven Fawcett, Rob Kearney, Aimee Anaya Everett, Jake Marconi and Harry Palley. Not a bad group of coaches\u2026\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, you can enter your contact information here to be notified when registration opens up.\n\nFor the rest of us, HWPO offers multiple training programs ranging from $20-40/month.\n\n",
