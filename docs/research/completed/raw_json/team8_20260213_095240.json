More recent work from Burke et al. has recommended carbohydrate intake ranges of 5 \u2013 7 g/kg/day for general training needs and 7 \u2013 12 g/kg/day for the increased needs of endurance athletes when performing intense physical exercise of 2 \u2013 3 hours daily (6,7).\n\n\u2026\n\nIn summary, carbohydrates are an effective ergogenic aid for endurance exercise performance, especially as the length of exercise time increases. A baseline daily nutrition intake of around 5 \u2013 8 g/kg/day or up to 7 \u2013 12 g/kg/day in the most extreme cases appears to be sufficient. Consumption of carbohydrates during longer exercise bouts may also be ergogenic with amounts up to 90 g/hour during cycling performance using a mixture of glucose and fructose being beneficial. These guidelines need to be tested in practice with each athlete as the amounts may be different, especially in endurance exercises, such as running, where GI issues are more common.",

The goal of these recommendations is to maximize the mitochondrial adaptation to endurance exercise and the muscle mass and strength adaptations to strength training. To do this, it is recommended that:\n\n\u2026\n\n- Fully refuel with carbohydrate between the morning high-intensity endurance training session and the afternoon strength session since AMPK can be activated by low glycogen stores (McBride et al., 2009), and SIRT1 is activated by caloric restriction (Schenk et al., 2011).\n\n\u2026\n\n- Resistance exercise should be supported by 0.25 g/kg of readily digestible, leucine-rich protein as soon as possible after training and every four hours thereafter. Since, in this scenario, resistance exercise is performed later in the day, it becomes even more important to also consume protein immediately prior to sleep to maximize the synthetic response overnight (Res et al., 2012).",

          "snippet": "- An acute exercise stimulus, particularly resistance exercise, and protein ingestion both stimulate muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and are synergistic when protein consumption occurs before or after resistance exercise.\n\n- For building muscle mass and for maintaining muscle mass through a positive muscle protein balance, an overall daily protein intake in the range of 1.4\u20132.0 g protein/kg body weight/day (g/kg/d) is sufficient for most exercising individuals, a value that falls in line within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range published by the Institute of Medicine for protein.\n\n\u2026\n\n- Recommendations regarding the optimal protein intake per serving for athletes to maximize MPS are mixed and are dependent upon age and recent resistance exercise stimuli. General recommendations are 0.25 g of a high-quality protein per kg of body weight, or an absolute dose of 20\u201340 g.\n\n- Acute protein doses should strive to contain 700\u20133000 mg of leucine and/or a higher relative leucine content, in addition to a balanced array of the essential amino acids (EAAs).\n\n\u2026\n\n- While it is possible for physically active individuals to obtain their daily protein requirements through the consumption of whole foods, supplementation is a practical way of ensuring intake of adequate protein quality and quantity, while minimizing caloric intake, particularly for athletes who typically complete high volumes of training.\n\n- Rapidly digested proteins that contain high proportions of essential amino acids (EAAs) and adequate leucine, are most effective in stimulating MPS.",

With hygrometry, or the ventilated sweat capsule technique, dry air with a known temperature is pumped at a constant flow rate through a capsule affixed to the skin. Local SR (LSR) onto the skin surface under the capsule (approximately 1\u201320 cm^2^) is determined from the change in the temperature and water vapor content of the effluent compared with the influent air of the capsule [58, 59].\nThe ventilated capsule technique is highly reliable (coefficient of variation [CV] of 2%) [60] and is considered the reference technique for measuring LSR [60\u201362]. However, hygrometry can overestimate sweat flow rates because the forced ventilation and maintenance of dry skin (which facilitates sweating) under the capsule is not representative of ambient conditions in some situations (e.g. the microclimate under clothing, or exercise in humid or still air).\n\n\u2026\n\nThe WBW method is considered the most accurate measure of whole-body sweat electrolyte loss because all sweat runoff is collected and accounted for and it does not interfere with the normal evaporative sweating process; however, WBW requires a controlled laboratory setting and the mode of exercise is primarily limited to stationary cycling (for more methodological details see Armstrong and Casa [84] and Shirreffs and Maughan [87]).",

Your body loses more sodium through sweat than any other electrolyte, making it crucial for endurance sports nutrition. Sodium helps maintain blood volume, supports muscle contractions, and prevents dangerous drops in blood pressure during prolonged exercise.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Best Electrolytes for Endurance Athletes: What to Look For\n\n### Optimal Electrolyte Ratios for Performance\n\nThe ideal electrolyte mix for endurance athletes typically contains 200-800mg of sodium, 150-300mg of potassium, and 50-100mg of magnesium per serving. However, these ratios should be adjusted based on your individual sweat rate, exercise intensity, and environmental conditions.\nAthletes who sweat heavily or train in hot, humid conditions may require higher sodium concentrations to replace losses effectively. Conversely, those training in cooler conditions or with lower sweat rates may need less concentrated solutions to avoid overconsumption.\n\nThe sodium-to-potassium ratio is particularly important for maintaining proper muscle function. Most sports scientists recommend a ratio between 2:1 and 4:1 (sodium to potassium) for optimal performance during endurance activities lasting longer than one hour.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions\n\n##### What is the best electrolyte ratio for endurance athletes?\n\nThe optimal ratio typically contains 200-800mg sodium, 150-300mg potassium, and 50-100mg magnesium per serving, with a sodium-to-potassium ratio between 2:1 and 4:1. However, individual needs vary based on sweat rate, exercise intensity, and environmental conditions.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Conclusion\n\nChoosing the right electrolyte mix for endurance athletes requires understanding your individual needs, exercise demands, and environmental conditions. The best electrolytes for endurance combine optimal ratios of sodium, potassium, and magnesium with practical delivery methods that fit your training routine. Whether you choose dedicated electrolyte supplements or sports drinks depends on your specific performance goals and nutritional requirements. Remember that proper hydration for athletes extends beyond just drinking fluids\u2014it requires strategic electrolyte replacement to maintain peak performance and prevent fatigue. By implementing the strategies outlined in this guide, you can optimize your electrolyte intake and unlock your full endurance potential. Consider exploring high-quality electrolyte supplements that align with your performance goals and training demands.\n\n## Your Cart\n\nTaxes Calculated at Checkout:Checkout",

Published regression equations can be used to predict whole body sweat [Na+] from local sweat [Na+].\n\n\u2026\n\n- There is considerable variability in sweating rate (~0.5 to 2.0 L/h) and sweat [Na+] (~10-90 mmol/L) within and among athletes.\n\n- Much of this variability is expected as a result of differences in exercise intensity, environmental conditions, heat acclimation status, genetic predisposition and many other factors. However, some (unexpected or unwanted) variability in results can be due to poor or inconsistent methodology (e.g., ~5-35% in sweating rate and ~5-100% in sweat [Na+]).",

However, by consuming fluid at just half your sweat rate (~16 fl oz per hour instead of 31 fl oz per hour) throughout the event, you could remain within your hydration zone for the full 3 hours of exercise.\nThe point is to know your sweat rate and hydrate strategically so that you remain comfortable and within your hydration zone. You may also be able to gradually train yourself to absorb more fluid during exercise. So, if you\u2019re having trouble consuming enough fluids, start at a volume you are comfortable with, and gradually increase the volume consumed per hour during training until you reach a more acceptable level of intake.\n\n\u2026\n\nIf you\u2019ve lost excessive fluid (more than 2% of your pre-exercise body weight) and need to be fully recovered in less than 12 hours in order to be ready for another workout or competition, a more aggressive rehydration program is needed. The new ACSM recommendations suggest that you drink about 23 fl oz of fluid for every pound of weight lost during exercise. Drink the necessary fluid gradually between the time you finish your first workout and 1-2 hours before you start your next one.",

However, athletes are increasingly turning to more cost-effective \u2018food-first\u2019 approaches for CHO ingestion to improve exercise performance. Mixed CHO foods including cooked lentils, oats, honey, raisins, rice, and potatoes are all effective pre-exercise CHO food sources. Caution is advised when selecting some of these foods as a primary CHO source, as some athletes may be prone to gastrointestinal discomfort\u2014especially regarding those foods where the quantities required for recommended CHO intake may be voluminous (e.g., potatoes). Palatability may be another barrier to the ingestion of some of these CHO-rich foods. Although most of these CHO-rich foods appear effective for exercise performance or recovery when consumed pre- and post-exercise, not all are viable to ingest during exercise due to difficulties in the quantities required, transport, and/or gastrointestinal discomfort. Raisins, bananas and honey may be particularly useful CHO foods for consumption during exercise, as they are easily transportable. Athletes should trial CHO food sources before, during and/or following training before implementation during competition.\n\n**Keywords:** carbohydrates, exercise performance, sport foods, endurance athletes, cycling, running\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nCarbohydrate (CHO) provision for exercise performance has become a requisite for competitive athletes, with the amount of CHO required intrinsically linked to the intensity and duration of exercise [1]. CHO may be consumed pre-exercise, during exercise, and post-exercise throughout training and competition, each of which will have implications as to the efficacy of the physiological responses and adaptations. There is some suggestion that periodised CHO ingestion may be beneficial for endurance athletes throughout training [2], though evidence to support this theory currently remains limited. Pre-exercise CHO ingestion can begin in the days leading into the exercise event to ensure that muscle glycogen stores are maximized [3,4]. Additionally, CHO ingestion provided up to 3\u20134 h prior to exercise is likely to increase muscle glycogen content. During exercise, CHO intake maintains blood glucose and/or provides fuel for oxidation, thus sparing muscle and liver glycogen [5,6]. Finally, CHO taken post-exercise aims to replenish both muscle and liver glycogen stores [7]. The speed of recovery depends on the timing and quantity of CHO [8], such that rapid and large quantities of CHO may be required to optimise performance during a subsequent exercise bout performed within hours of the previous exercise bout [9]. Thus, CHO ingestion is an important nutritional aspect to consider for both training and competition.\n\nCHO supplements have become commonplace among athletic populations, with numerous commercially available products, including cereal bars, gels, drinks and powders, considered effective evidence-based CHO sources to improve endurance exercise performance [10,11]. Despite the practicalities of employing such CHO-rich products, particularly during exercise, a \u2018food-first\u2019 approach to CHO ingestion for exercise may be of great relevance since acquiring CHO via dietary sources will also lead to co-ingestion of other important macro- (e.g., proteins and lipids) and micro- (e.g., vitamins and minerals) nutrients which are of benefit to athletes [12,13,14]. Further, athletes may wish to prioritise food over supplements for a multitude of personal reasons, including food choices (e.g., animal or plant-based), taste, gastrointestinal discomfort, cost, sustainability, behaviour, health and religion [12,15,16,17,18]. Dietary sources of CHO are numerous, including lentils, bananas, oats, honey, raisins, potatoes, rice, pasta. Each of these foods has its unique macronutrient and micronutrient content that will modify the speed at which they increase glucose in the bloodstream (i.e., their glycaemic index [GI]). The GI is a rating system based upon how much blood glucose is increased by ingesting specific foods, categorized into low-to-moderate and high GI foods. Foods with different GI values lead to a different metabolic response [19]; however, the GI of a pre-exercise meal has no clear benefit for endurance performance [20]. In contrast, high-GI CHO foods ingested during recovery between exercise bouts may accelerate post-exercise muscle glycogen storage [21] and improve subsequent exercise performance [22]. Thus, different CHO-food sources with different GI may be more or less efficient for exercise performance and glycogen replenishment when recovery time is short. However, the feasibility of implementing each dietary CHO source for pre-exercise, during exercise, and for post-exercise consumption is an important consideration for athletes. This narrative review aimed to determine whether a food-first approach to CHO provision for endurance exercise is an appropriate means to fuel endurance exercise and optimise performance compared to traditional CHO supplements.\n\n## 2. Pre-Exercise CHO Ingestion\n\nInitial studies tested different pre-exercise GI foods on substrate utilization and exercise performance mediated by different insulin responses, with equivocal findings between low- and high-GI foods [23,24]. While some evidence showed positive effects after consuming low-GI foods, other studies reported no difference between pre-exercise low-GI foods compared to high-GI foods [20,25]. The consumption of 1\u20134 g\u00b7kg^\u22121^ body mass (BM) of CHO is generally recommended 1 to 4 h prior to endurance exercise (Figure 1) [26]. Pre-exercise food selection depends on various factors such as sex, training status, and/or habitual dietary intake of endurance athletes [27]; however, regardless of individuals\u2019 choices, pre-exercise ingestion of CHO appears to be important. For example, combining a 2.5 g CHO\u00b7kg^\u22121^ BM meal before exercise with a CHO drink (6.9% CHO) during exercise was better for performance compared to CHO ingestion during exercise alone, or no CHO (placebo) during a run to exhaustion at 70%V\u0307Omax [28] (Table 1). Aandahl et al. [29] compared a high (3 g\u00b7kg BM) and low (0.5 g\u00b7kg^\u22121^ BM) CHO pre-exercise meal ingested ~3.5 h before exercise on physiological variables and time-to-exhaustion during a graded exercise test. Recreational and well-trained endurance athletes were recruited and also performed a trial while fasting. The high-CHO meal improved exercise performance relative to the low-CHO meal and the fasting state, although no differences in physiological responses were shown. These performance effects were evident for both trained and recreational athletes, demonstrating that a high CHO pre-exercise meal appears to be better for performance than a low-CHO meal or nothing.\n\nWhen considering pre-exercise CHO intake, many individuals will indicate foods such as potatoes, rice, and pasta as \u201ctypical\u201d CHO sources. Potatoes are predominantly composed of water with only ~20 g of CHO per 100 g of boiled potato. Both white and brown rice consist predominantly of water (~69\u201370%) and contain an average of 28 g and 26 g of CHO per 100 g. White or \u201crefined\u201d pasta is composed of ~67% water, and 100 g of plain cooked spaghetti provides approximately 26 g of CHO. Cooked lentils are another CHO food [30] and are composed of ~19.5% CHO. All these are viable options as pre-exercise CHO meal options for athletes aiming to optimise their exercise performance, although athletes should be aware that they are relatively low in CHO per total volume, with only 20\u201330% comprised of CHO (Figure 2).\n\nThomas et al. [31] recruited eight trained cyclists who pedalled to exhaustion at 65\u201370% V\u0307O~2max~ following the ingestion of either lentils, potatoes, glucose or water only, provided 1 h before exercise. Each meal provided 1 g\u00b7kg^\u22121^ BM of CHO. The volunteers ingested approximately 70 g of CHO, meaning they had to consume ~650 g of cooked potatoes and ~430 g of cooked lentils. Plasma glucose peaked ~45 min after ingestion with potatoes, likely due to its high-GI leading to the rapid absorption of CHO. The plasma glucose and insulin responses were lower following lentils ingestion, and CHO oxidation was lower during exercise with lentils compared to the glucose and potato conditions. Importantly, time-to-exhaustion was greater in the lentil condition compared to the other CHO conditions and water, while the glucose and potato conditions did not significantly improve performance compared to water. These findings suggests that lentils may be an effective pre-exercise CHO food source to be ingested alone, or as part of a mixed-CHO meal, if ingested 1\u20133 h before exercise, and may enhance metabolic responses (higher fat oxidation, lower insulin, and CHO oxidation) [32] during submaximal exercise compared to other CHO food sources.\n\nBananas are a CHO-rich fruit containing a mixture of glucose, fructose and sucrose. Mitchell et al. [33] compared various sources of pre-exercise (\u221260 min) CHO ingestion in trained runners in a hot environment (32 \u00b0C, 65% relative humidity). The CHO conditions included banana slurries (banana and water; 54 g CHO), a CHO solution mixture of glucose and fructose (54 g CHO), a high fructose corn syrup solution (72 g CHO), a glucose-only solution (54 g CHO), a saccharose and glucose mixture solution (54 g CHO), and a placebo drink (water identical in flavour, texture and colour). The different types of CHO altered the blood glucose response compared to the placebo drink, although this had no influence on 10 km running performance with no differences between any condition. A higher fluid retention was shown with the glucose/fructose and glucose-only solutions, likely due to the high sodium content [33]. The lack of a performance improvement between CHO forms compared to placebo is perhaps unsurprising, since CHO ingestion prior to short-duration exercise (<1 h) may not be necessary [1], and makes it difficult to speculate as to the efficacy of pre-exercise CHO from bananas.\n\nRaisins are a type of sun-dried grape and a rich source of CHO [34]. Kern et al. [35] compared the pre-exercise ingestion of raisins to a CHO sport gel on 45 min cycling at 70% V\u0307O~2max~, followed by a 15 min performance time-trial (TT). Eight trained endurance cyclists ingested 1 g\u00b7kg^\u22121^ BM CHO from either raisins or sports gel 45 min prior to the test and showed a similar amount of total work carried out between the raisin and sports gel, meaning that pre-exercise CHO provision via raisins and sports gels produced an equal power output during the exercise. Thus, raisins appear to be an appropriate alternative pre-exercise CHO food source to CHO supplements, though more confirmatory studies are warranted.\n\nOats are a rich source of CHO, providing ~68 g CHO per 100 g [36]. Paul et al. [37] examined the effects of three isoenergetic pre-exercise meals consisting of oats (containing 41.5 g CHO), wheat (containing 53.9 g CHO) and corn cereals (containing 54.7 g CHO) plus skimmed milk, compared to a fasting control trial. Twelve healthy adults ingested the pre-exercise meals 90 min before 90 min of steady-state cycling at 60% V\u0307O~2peak~ followed by a 6.4 km TT. There was no performance improvement with any meal compared to the fasted trial, though it must be acknowledged that there was ~12 g less CHO in the oat meal versus the other meals. Despite no performance effect, the feeling of fatigue was greater in the fasted trial, measured using the profile of mood states (POMS) questionnaire, than in the other treatments. Jones et al. [38] compared three available \u201ccost-effective\u201d oat- and wheat-based CHO meals relative to a commercial sports bar. Eight endurance-trained males ingested four isoenergetic meals including (i) a semi-liquid oat-based combination (77% CHO), (ii) a semi-liquid oat-based CHO (68% CHO), (iii) a semi-liquid wheat-based CHO) (75% CHO), and (iv) a dense solid, fructose-based sports bar (69% CHO). Meals were provided 2 h before a 60 min self-paced cycle ergometer test. Regardless of which meal was ingested, there was no difference in heart rate, oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange ratio or exercise performance. These data suggest that each CHO source was equally beneficial for this type of exercise, although this study is limited by the lack of a control treatment to determine whether CHO is beneficial compared to no CHO. Kirwan et al. [39] investigated the effect of oat-based breakfast meals provided 45 min prior to a cycle to exhaustion at 60% V\u0307O~2peak~ in recreationally active women. The breakfasts consisted of sweetened whole-grain rolled oats (75 g CHO + 7 g fibre), sweetened whole-oat flour (75 g CHO + 3 g fibre) or 300 mL of water as a control. Exercise performance improved by 16% and 10% in the rolled and flour oat conditions compared to control, with no difference between meals. In a similar study, 75 g CHO in regular whole grain rolled oats mixed with 300 mL of water improved cycling exercise to exhaustion at 60% V\u0307O~2peak~ compared to water alone (control) when ingested 45 min before exercise [40]. Another study by the same research group showed that 75 g of CHO ingested as rolled oats improved cycling time-to-exhaustion at 60% V\u0307O~2peak~ compared to control, while 75 g in puffed rice did not. The data from these studies suggest that oats may be a suitable pre-exercise CHO source for endurance exercise. Importantly, oats are often consumed mixed with other foods such as honey, banana, milk, cherries and chia seeds to enhance palatability. Work is needed to consider these kinds of mixed meals on metabolism and exercise performance.\n\nOne study investigated the effect of a pre-exercise meal containing rice on 21 km running performance in eight endurance-trained male runners [41]. Meals were provided 2 h prior to exercise and consisted of a non-CHO low energy jelly (control), or one of two dishes equivalent in calories and CHO content (61%), namely a high-GI meal containing 92 g of jasmine rice and a low-GI meal containing no rice. A CHO-electrolyte drink (6.6% glucose) was also provided every 2.5 km throughout the exercise at 2 mL\u00b7kg^\u22121^ BM in all trials (total ~74 g CHO). Time-to-complete the 21 km run was not different between the CHO meals, although only the rice-based meal improved performance compared to control. These data provide some evidence to suggest that a pre-exercise CHO meal containing rice may be a useful strategy for endurance exercise performance. However, rice contains a substantial amount of water, meaning that to obtain CHO intakes of 30 g it would be necessary to ingest approximately 106 g of white rice or 116 g of brown rice (Figure 2). This may trigger some gastric discomfort due to the amount of food needed to achieve the desired quantity of CHO, and individuals are encouraged to determine their individual response to consumption of this food.\n\nTraditional CHO food sources such as pasta, lentils, potato and rice may be interesting CHO sources to implement pre-exercise, although individuals should be wary of the amount of CHO in some of these as they are relatively low compared to other sources (Figure 2). This means that the consumption of large quantities of food may be necessary to achieve the desired CHO levels (e.g., ~150 g of potatoes per 30 g of CHO; Figure 2), but this could lead to gastric discomfort [42]. More studies are needed to determine whether a single CHO source like pasta, lentils, rice, or potato alone is a more viable pre-exercise CHO loading strategy versus mixed high CHO meals. Bananas may also be considered as a pre-exercise CHO snack to be ingested <2 h before exercise for those athletes that feel hungry close to exercise. Furthermore, those wishing to add supplemental CHO to foods to achieve the desired CHO dose may do so [43].\n\n### Table 1.\n\nSummary of studies exploring the effects of pre-exercise CHO food ingestion on endurance exercise performance.\n\n|Study|Subjects|Exercise Test|Treatments|Timing|Performance|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|Thomas et al.

CHO Ingestion during Exercise\n\nIn addition to pre-exercise CHO intake, CHO ingestion during endurance exercise is considered essential to maintaining performance. When a meal was provided pre-exercise (2.5 g CHO\u00b7kg^\u22121^ BM) and CHO given during exercise, the time-to-exhaustion during endurance exercise was 12% greater than when CHO was provided before exercise only, and 22% greater compared to a placebo [44]. When exercise lasts between 1 and 3 h, ingesting 30\u201360 g\u00b7h^\u22121^ of CHO is commonly recommended [1]. Isotonic CHO drinks containing multiple CHOs at a dose of 60\u201390 g\u00b7h^\u22121^ during exercise have been suggested to enhance endurance capacity when activity is extended above 3 h [1,45]. These larger doses of mixed CHO (e.g., glucose and fructose in a 2:1 ratio [45]) promote increased CHO absorption via two different gut transporters. Endurance athletes tend to favour transportable CHO supplements such as hydrogels, shots, bars, and chews during competition [42,46] because of higher gastrointestinal tolerability, CHO absorption and oxidation rates [47]. However, endurance athletes may see eating CHO-rich fruits and foods as a natural and cost-effective source for supplying CHO during exercise. Naturally, an important consideration is that these foods should be easily transportable for an athlete.\n\nBananas could be an excellent CHO source (fructose: glucose ratio of ~1:1) during exercise [48]. Nieman et al. [49] compared banana ingestion to a CHO drink on exercise metabolism and performance (Table 2). They reported no significant difference in blood glucose, blood lactate or 75 km cycling TT performance when 14 trained cyclists ingested 200 mg\u00b7kg^\u22121^ BM of CHO every 15 min from either bananas or a 6% CHO sports drink. Participants did report feeling significantly fuller and more bloated when consuming bananas, which may be due to the high fibre intake (~15 g). Although this did not modify exercise performance here, this may become a greater issue during longer distances requiring more CHO intake. In another study, two types of bananas (Cavendish and mini yellow) and a 6% CHO beverage led to similar performance times during a 75 km cycling TT, although none were improved compared to water alone [50]. The same research group also compared banana ingestion to pear ingestion or water alone during a 75 km cycling TT [51]. Twenty male cyclists ingested 400 mg\u00b7kg^\u22121^ BM CHO from either banana or pear alongside 5 mL\u00b7kg^\u22121^ BM of water, or water alone, 20 min prior to initiating exercise. A further 150 mg\u00b7kg^\u22121^ BM of CHO was ingested every 15 min throughout the test. Performance times for the banana and pear treatments were faster than water alone. These data suggest that bananas may be a good CHO source during exercise to improve endurance exercise performance. However, more research should determine the rate of CHO oxidation and exercise performance with banana ingestion compared to commonly employed CHO supplements during different types of endurance exercise tests. The size of bananas makes them easily transportable and an excellent CHO option during endurance exercise, though athletes may wish to bear in mind that they are delicate and could be damaged or undergo browning, thus making them less palatable to some individuals. Furthermore, carrying the number of bananas required to fuel prolonged exercise may not always be practical, especially for runners or during competition. Nonetheless, those engaged in endurance exercise may wish to replace a number of CHO supplements with bananas depending upon how many they can practically carry on them (Figure 3A).\n\n### Table 2.\n\nSummary of studies exploring the effects of CHO foods ingestion during exercise on performance.\n\n|Study|Subjects|Exercise Test|Treatments|Timing|Performance|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|Earnest et al.

Athletes can choose to replace some, or all, of their supplemental CHO with food choices. Panel (): Bananas. Panel (): Honey.\n\nHoney is a natural food made by honeybees via nectar sourced from flowers [57]. CHO is the main constituent of honey (~80\u201385%), including fructose, glucose, small amounts of sucrose, and varying amounts of maltose based on the botanical source of the different regions of honey breeding [58]. Two studies have shown performance benefits with honey ingestion during endurance cycling [52] and running [59]. Earnest et al. [52] showed similar performance improvements when amateur cyclists ingested 15 g of CHO from sports gels (dextrose, high GI: 100) or honey (low-GI: 35) every 16 km during a 64 km cycling TT compared to a water-only trial. Both CHO treatments allowed participants to generate more power during the last 16 km. There was a lack of blinding due to the absence of a matching placebo in colour and taste, which means modified performance may have been due to placebo effects [60]. Nevertheless, these data do show promise for the use of honey as a CHO source during exercise and may lead to improvements similar to those seen with traditional CHO supplements. Honey certainly appears more effective than no CHO. Honey may be a particularly interesting option during exercise when high CHO quantities are required due to its high CHO content (Figure 1), and glucose and fructose constitution. It is well-recognized that CHO beverages containing both glucose and fructose at doses of 60\u201390 g\u00b7h^\u22121^ may augment endurance exercise capacity compared to glucose alone. Adding fructose to glucose would increase CHO oxidation and enhance the gastric emptying rate due to a higher absorption rate via two different intestinal transporters since glucose transport is saturated at ~60 g\u00b7h^\u22121^ [1,61]. Honey can easily be transported, either diluted in water or in small portable plastic sachets which athletes can chew while exercising. However, honey is considered a high FODMAP food due to its high fructose content [62] and may need to be tested by athletes in training sessions to minimize the potential risk of gastrointestinal distress, while in addition it is not suitable for vegan athletes. Similar to bananas, honey could replace some, or all, CHO supplements during exercise (Figure 3B).\n\nRaisins are a natural CHO source that can be ingested during exercise (glucose and fructose~1.1:1 ratio [63,64,65]). Rietschier et al. [53] provided 10 male endurance-trained athletes 1.1 g\u00b7kg^\u22121^ BM CHO from either six servings of 28 g raisin or 26 g sport jellybeans every 20 min during a 120 min intense cycle followed by a 10 km TT. Both forms of CHO maintained similar blood glucose levels during exercise, with no significant difference in TT performance. However, the lack of a placebo or control condition in either study is a limitation that does not allow us to draw any definitive conclusions on whether raisins may be more or less effective than commercial CHO sources. Too et al. [54] compared raisin ingestion to CHO-rich sport chews and water drinks. Eleven competitive endurance runners were provided 500 mg\u00b7kg^\u22121^ BM before exercise and 200 mg\u00b7kg^\u22121^ BM every 20 min throughout 80 min treadmill running at 75% V\u0307O~2max~ followed by a 5 km TT. There were no significant metabolic or performance differences between the raisins and sport chew trials; however, both CHO trials led to a greater performance compared to water alone. Corinthian currant [55], a dried grape derived from black grapes, has also shown similar performance improvements compared to a glucose drink (1.5 g\u00b7kg^\u22121^ BM) during a cycle to exhaustion at 95% V\u0307O~2max~ following 90 min of cycling at 60\u201370% V\u0307O~2max~. These data provide evidence that raisins can be considered an alternative to common CHO supplements during endurance exercise. They are also CHO dense (Figure 2), easily transportable as either food or drink, and are generally well-tolerated without significant gastrointestinal discomfort [54,55].\n\nTransportability and digestibility are key when considering CHO ingestion throughout exercise. Although foods such as potatoes, rice and pasta in their own right might be appropriate CHO sources during exercise, practical limitations might not allow their implementation in practice. For example, Salvador et al. [56] compared the performance effects of CHO obtained from mashed potatoes with an equivalent of CHO from a gel. Cyclists performed 120 min of intermittent cycling at 60\u201385% V\u0307O~2peak~ before a TT to complete 6 kJ\u00b7kg^\u22121^ BM and ingested 15 g of CHO from potato or a CHO gel every 15 min throughout the intermittent test. To obtain 15 g of CHO within each form, participants had to ingest 128.5 g of mashed potato but only 23 g of CHO gel. TT performance was improved with CHO compared to water alone but did not differ between CHO supplement forms. Although this suggests that potato ingestion throughout the exercise was equally effective as a CHO gel, potato ingestion was associated with more gastrointestinal discomfort during the test, likely due to the greater volume ingested. Furthermore, the transport of potatoes in mashed (or any) form is far less feasible than a CHO gel, although anecdotally cyclists are known to transport baked potatoes on long rides for fuel. A similar conclusion could be reached for pasta and rice. Although rice cakes may be considered an alternative form of rice consumption, leading to similar performance times as CHO provision in gels [66], these are often made from glutinous rice powder, and it is debatable whether these can still be considered a whole food. Thus, while some data support the potential use of potatoes as a CHO source during exercise, individuals should be wary of their difficulty in transport and the quantity needed to attain suggested ingestion rates of 60\u201390 g\u00b7h^\u22121^ (Figure 1).\n\nCollectively, these studies show that food-based sources such as banana, honey and raisins are excellent alternative CHO sources to be ingested during exercise. They are as effective as commercial-based CHO supplements such as gels and sports drinks to improve prolonged endurance performance [35,49,51,52,53,54,56,63,67]. However, the higher potential gastrointestinal distress risk related to a greater fructose ratio, fibre content and quantity to meet standard CHO doses (60\u201390 g\u00b7h^\u22121^) with CHO foods compared to CHO supplements may highlight the more effective role of CHO supplements to be ingested during exercise [63,67,68]. Moreover, it is not clear if CHO provided at the range of 90\u2013120 g\u00b7h^\u22121^ from food-based sources can still improve endurance performance without any gastrointestinal discomfort. Furthermore, studies have yet to compare CHO absorption and oxidation rates of food-based CHO sources with different GI responses versus isotonic CHO drinks.\n\nNevertheless, athletes can ingest a combination of foods and supplements to achieve their CHO requirements during exercise (Figure 3). In fact, food sources can be fortified with CHO to provide the desired amount. Reynolds et al. [69] showed that a natural CHO source of apple puree fortified with maltodextrin to provide an equal dose of glucose to a sports drink providing 60 g\u00b7h^\u22121^ in a 2:1 glucose-to-fructose ratio was equally effective for ~15 min TT performance following 120 min cycling.\n\n## 4. Post-Exercise CHO Ingestion\n\nFollowing endurance exercise the replenishment of CHO is critical, particularly when recovery time between exercise sessions is limited (<4 h). CHO provision at 1\u20131.2 g\u00b7kg^\u22121^ BM is recommended to maximize muscle glycogen replenishment and storage to optimise subsequent exercise performance [7]. High-GI CHO foods have been suggested to be preferable to low GI CHO foods to optimize post-exercise glycogen replenishment [21,70], mediated by higher insulin responses [21], which may augment subsequent endurance performance [22] (Table 3). Wong et al. [22] compared high and low-GI CHO foods during 4 h recovery after 90 min constant pace running at 70% V\u0307O~2max~ in endurance-trained runners. Twenty min after the first test, participants ingested either a high-GI meal (GI = 77) or a low-GI meal (GI = 37), both providing 1.5 g\u00b7kg^\u22121^ BM CHO. The subsequent endurance running capacity was 15% greater following the high-GI versus low-GI meal. Stevenson et al. [70] compared high versus low isocaloric GI CHO foods providing 8 g\u00b7kg^\u22121^ BM CHO across four meals during 24 h recovery after 90 min running on a treadmill at 70% V\u0307O~2max~. The next day\u2019s run to exhaustion at 70% V\u0307O~2max~ was longer following low-GI vs. high-GI foods; this may have been due to a higher fat oxidation during the exercise following the low-GI diet [70]. The discrepancy between these results for high and low GI meals could be explained by the different CHO loading amounts (1.5 g\u00b7kg^\u22121^ BM vs. 8 g\u00b7kg^\u22121^ BM) and recovery times (24 h vs. 4 h) within these two studies [22,70]. Longer recovery times to ingest higher CHO amounts from low-GI CHO sources may highlight the potential metabolic benefits of low-GI CHO for endurance athletes.\n\nVarious high CHO food sources are available for endurance athletes to ingest during the short-term recovery period (Figure 1). In this regard, Murdoch et al. [71] investigated the effect of banana ingestion provided in either solid or slurry form (1.1 g\u00b7kg^\u22121^ BM CHO) following a 90 min run and 90 min cycle on subsequent exercise capacity. Eight highly trained triathlon athletes ingested the bananas or a placebo drink in the 20 min recovery time following the initial 180 min of exercise, before performing a cycle to exhaustion at 70% V\u0307O~2max~. TTE was 16 (slurried form) and 18 (solid form) min greater with the bananas compared to placebo, with no difference between the CHO forms. Although intriguing, the very short recovery time between endurance tests precluded any solid conclusions regarding banana ingestion for recovery and performance in the hours following an initial exercise bout, or subsequent next-day performance. Ahmad et al. [59] showed that participants could cover more distance during a 20 min running TT following an initial run at 65% V\u0307O~2max~ in the heat (31 \u00b0C, 70% relative humidity) before a 2 h rehydration phase when they were provided a honey beverage (6.8% CHO content equivalent to compensate 150% of body weight loss) compared to plain water. Thus, honey ingestion might be an interesting CHO source when recovery time is short, though it is unclear if it is as effective as traditional CHO supplement sources as a recovery aid.\n\nFlynn et al. [72] recruited male and female recreational athletes to ingest either potato-based foods or various CHO supplements (both providing 1.6 g\u00b7kg^\u22121^ BM CHO) following a 90 min cycle; after 4 h recovery, they performed a 20 km cycling TT. There were no differences in muscle glycogen synthesis rate or time-trial performance between the CHO sources [72]. Cramer et al. [73] also showed no difference in muscle glycogen synthesis rates and 20 km TT endurance performance between a high-CHO fast-food diet and CHO supplements ingested during the 4 h recovery period between two exercise bouts. These data suggest that the ingestion of CHO-rich foods, such as potatoes, is equally effective for the recovery of muscle glycogen and subsequent exercise performance as traditional CHO supplements (Table 3).\n\nChocolate milk is a popular food-based sports beverage and comprises approximately ~11\u201314% CHO [36]. Chocolate milk may be an appropriate CHO beverage to support post-exercise muscle glycogen re-synthesis [74], and improve subsequent endurance exercise performance [75,76]. Several studies have compared chocolate milk versus a CHO-replacement fluid and fluid replacement drink during varying recovery periods (2\u201318 h) after exercise, with beneficial effects on subsequent performance compared to both CHO-replacement fluid and a fluid replacement drink [75,76,77,78]. Two recent meta-analyses and systematic reviews concluded that chocolate milk can increase muscle glycogen storage as much as an isocaloric CHO drink [74], and can improve exercise time-to-exhaustion compared to a placebo beverage, with no differences compared to a CHO sport drinks [79]. Since milk contains other important macronutrients (protein and fats) and has better hydrating properties than water [80], chocolate milk may be an interesting post-exercise CHO-replenishment strategy for athletes.\n\nVlahoyiannis et al. [81] investigated the effects of a high and low-GI post-exercise meal on subsequent sleep quality and next-day 5 km cycling TT performance. Recreationally trained men performed a sprint interval exercise before immediately consuming either a high-GI (GI = 109) meal, consisting of jasmine rice and vegetables, or a low-GI meal (GI = 52), consisting of parboiled rice and vegetables; both meals provided 2 g\u00b7kg^\u22121^ BM CHO. Next-day 5 km cycling performance was not different between meals, despite increased sleep duration and sleep efficiency, and reduced sleep onset latency, following the high-GI meal. The lack of a performance effect may be due to the exercise duration (7\u20138 min), which may be too short to be substantially influenced by a high- or low-GI meal. This study [81] is limited by the lack of a control trial in which no dietary CHO was provided following the sprint exercise, though the finding that a high-GI diet might improve aspects of sleep is intriguing and warrants further investigation. More studies are needed to examine the effects of CHO-based foods with different GI indexes to determine the optimal scenario under which to employ high- or low-GI CHO foods for recovery.\n\nWhile high-GI foods may promote muscle glycogen synthesis when a short recovery time is needed between two exercise sessions, muscle glycogen optimization over a 24 h recovery time is more dependent on the total CHO dose ingestion. More recently, eight male endurance athletes ingested 24 h high CHO meals with doses of 5, 7 and 10 g\u00b7kg^\u22121^ BM in a crossover study design after a 90 min glycogen depletion cycling test [82]. The results indicated that while 7\u201310 g\u00b7kg^\u22121^ BM of CHO foods managed to restore muscle glycogen to pre-exercise levels, 5 g\u00b7kg^\u22121^ BM of high CHO foods was insufficient to saturate muscle glycogen storage to the pre-exercise level [82]. Food-based CHO sources appear to be an effective alternative to commercial CHO supplements for post-exercise glycogen resynthesis and subsequent endurance performance improvement (Figure 1). High-GI foods may be preferable when there is a short recovery period between exercise bouts, while total CHO consumed appears more critical when longer recovery periods are possible. Further, it is important to highlight that CHO co-ingested with protein after exercise may enhance glycogen synthesis but only when the added energy of protein is ingested in addition to, not in replacement of, carbohydrates [83].\n\n### Table 3.\n\nSummary of studies exploring the effects of post-exercise CHO food ingestion on performance.\n\n|Study|Subjects|Exercise Test|Treatments|Timing|Performance|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|Murdoch et al.

Limitations and Future Directions\n\nScientific support for a food-first approach to CHO supplementation for endurance exercise performance is scarce, though some data do suggest that many foods are suitable CHO sources for endurance athletes. Nonetheless, strong conclusions are hindered by small samples sizes and a lack of appropriate controls, since many studies compared CHO intake in foods to water-only conditions. Many of the studies discussed here evaluated exercise performance using cycling protocols which, although suitable for cyclists, may not be applicable to runners or cross-country skiers who may be more affected by a full stomach should they aim to ingest recommended CHO doses via foods. Additionally, most studies recruited recreational or low-level athletes. Although these populations can still provide important information, results may not be directly applicable to top-level athletes due to training adaptations including CHO transport via training the gut [84]. More well-designed experimental studies with sufficient samples sizes to determine statistical significance and comparisons against \u201cgold-standard\u201d commercial CHO products such as bars, gels, drinks and powders are required to establish the extent to which these food sources can be considered optimal CHO for endurance exercise performance. This includes determining their efficacy as a pre-exercise, during exercise and post-exercise CHO source. It is particularly important that future lab-based studies investigating CHO provision throughout exercise provide these foods to adequately saturate different gut CHO transportable to accelerate higher CHO absorption and oxidation during training and competition. Further, future research is warranted to explore sex-based differences with regard to fuel utilization using different CHO foods before, during, and after endurance exercise. In addition, it is important to determine the extent to which these foods are tolerated by athletes across a wide range of different exercise modalities using validated questionnaires to determine feelings of stomach fullness and discomfort. Furthermore, the effectiveness of sustainably sourced CHO foods should be considered a priority for research in light of growing numbers of individuals in search of ethical alternatives.\n\n## 6. Conclusions\n\nA CHO-rich diet can optimise muscle glycogen stores and aid endurance exercise performance. While current recommendations for CHO ingestion commonly focus on energy and sports drinks, many athletes may wish to take a food-first approach where viable, although it must be noted that there are both pros and cons to this approach (Figure 4). Aside from CHO, many of these food sources provide protein, fats and fibres, vitamins and other micronutrients such as polyphenols that may also benefit endurance athletes. Direct research on many of the dietary CHO sources discussed here and endurance exercise is limited. All CHO sources could be considered interesting as compositions of meal plans throughout training and during the days leading up to competition to ensure muscle glycogen stores are maximized, although high-GI foods may be superior to low-GI foods to rapidly resynthesise muscle glycogen following exercise, and should thus be prioritised during intense competition. Although most of these CHO-rich foods appear equally effective for exercise performance compared to favoured CHO supplements such as drinks, gels and bars, not all of these food sources are equally viable during exercise due to difficulties in achieving the necessary quantities and ease of transport. Likewise, gastrointestinal discomfort appears more common with some of these food choices, likely due to the large quantities required to obtain recommended CHO doses. Endurance athletes can use the information provided herein to decide which CHO food source they may wish to trial before, during and/or following training and/or competition.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nA.N., B.S., N.G., A.A., E.B., A.H., S.C.F., M.S.K. and R.K. wrote the first draft of the review; A.N., B.S. and A.A. revised the original review.

          "snippet": "To listen to advertisements for preworkout products, sports drinks, electrolyte replacers and recovery beverages, you\u2019d think every person who exercises needs to worry about maintaining optimal fluid and electrolyte balance for every workout. While there\u2019s no harm in vigilantly replacing sweat losses, please rest assured: Most fitness exercisers and athletes who train for less than 60-90 minutes a day in normal weather conditions are unlikely to become dehydrated or depleted of electrolytes. That\u2019s most of us!\n\nHowever, certain athletes\n\n*should* pay close attention to maintaining a proper fluid and electrolyte balance, including long-distance cyclists, marathoners, triathletes and other endurance athletes who train in the heat for extended periods of time. So should soccer players during a hot-weather tournament, competitive tennis players baking on sunny tennis courts, football players training in full uniform during hot weather and athletes who simply sweat a lot. (Some athletes sweat more than others; sweat rates vary widely!)\n\nDehydration can happen during one bout of intensive exercise; other times, it sneaks in over the course of several days of hot weather. The longer your exposure to heat, the greater your risk of becoming dehydrated. That\u2019s why soldiers, construction workers and gardeners who are exposed day after day to hot weather should have a fluid plan that contributes to a need to urinate at least every four hours. The goal is to lose no more than 2% of your body weight during a workout. That\u2019s three pounds of sweat for a 150-pound athlete (as calculated from pre- and post-exercise weigh-ins). Minimizing dehydration during exercise contributes to a far easier recovery. Post workout, you\u2019ll feel better and have more energy the rest of your day. No need to feel zapped!\n\nThe following hydration facts and fallacies can help you better survive training and competing in today\u2019s hotter climate.\n\n**1. Being well hydrated makes exercise **feel ** easier.**\n\nYour body functions best physically and mentally when it is in fluid and electrolyte balance \u2014 not underhydrated and certainly not seriously dehydrated.\n\n#### 2. When you exercise dehydrated, your muscles, heart, lungs and brain function less efficiently.\n\nThese negative effects get amplified by heat and your performance will decline. In a study with cyclists who biked for two hours in the heat, those who drank too little and lost 2% of their body weight reported higher heart rate, perceived effort and glycogen use compared to the 1% dehydrated cyclists. Interestingly, many top marathoners lose 5-6% of their body weight (a gallon of sweat!) during a marathon. Would they perform even better if they could drink more?\n\n#### 3. We cannot adapt to dehydration; we only adjust to the feeling of being dehydrated.\n\nThat is, if from time to time you train underhydrated, you will become familiar with \u2014and potentially get used to \u2014 how it feels. But the far wiser path is to learn to\n\n*prevent* dehydration by matching sweat losses with fluid intake. Practice doing this during training sessions!\n\n#### 4. Your desire to drink is controlled by feedback loops that make you feel thirsty (or not).\n\nThe feedback is based on losses of water and sodium from the kidneys. Tanking up two hours before exercise allows time for the kidneys to process and eliminate the excess before you start to exercise. During exercise, kidneys conserve water and produce less urine; hence, you\u2019ll experience less of an urge to urinate.\n\n#### 5. The right balance of body fluids inside and around cells gets regulated by electrolytes such as sodium and potassium.\n\nThe concentration of sodium in your blood actually increases during exercise because you lose proportionately more water than sodium \u2014 unless you overhydrate by drinking too much plain water during extended exercise. (Bad idea!) The more you train in the heat, the less sodium you lose because your body learns to conserve sodium (and other electrolytes).\n\n#### 6. An effective way to help maintain fluid and electrolyte balance is to consume about 500 milligrams of sodium 90 minutes before you start to exercise in the heat.\n\nThat\u2019s as simple as adding extra salt to pre-exercise oatmeal, eggs or potatoes\n\n*before* you exercise in the heat. Doing so will help retain fluid, delay dehydration and enhance endurance.\n\n#### 7. In general, commercial electrolyte replacers are more about convenience than necessity.\n\nReal foods like olives, pickles and crackers with cheese after a sweaty workout can \u201cwork\u201d as well as a commercial product. You just need to plan ahead and buy the salty foods so they are readily available. And if you think that might not happen, that\u2019s where the electrolyte products can come in handy.\n\n#### 8. Athletes who sweat heavily might lose about 500 to 700 mg sodium in an hour of vigorous exercise.\n\nAnd while a sports drink is handy\n\n*during* exercise, real foods offer more sodium afterwards.\n\n|Commercial Options|Sodium (mg)|Salty Foods|Sodium (mg)|\n|--|--|--|--|\n|Electrolyte water, 8 oz|120|String cheese, 1 stick|220|\n|Sports drink, 8 oz|110|Beef jerky, 1 oz|600|\n|Electrolyte gel, 1 packet|125|1/4 tsp. salt|600|\n|Electrolyte tablet, 1 tablet|150|Broth, one bouillon cube|1,020|\n#### 9. In a study with subjects who drank either whole milk, skim milk, orange juice or a commercial electrolyte replacement solution, the beverages that best retained fluids were whole and skim milk.\n\nThat\u2019s because milk has a strong electrolyte content and rehydrates better than a low-electrolyte beverage (i.e., plain water). Carbs, along with electrolytes, further stimulate rapid fluid absorption. For post-exercise recovery, chocolate milk is an excellent carb-electrolyte choice. Plus, it also offers protein to help repair and build muscle. And most importantly, it\u2019s yummy. Let\u2019s drink to that!\n\nBoston-area sports nutritionist\n\n**Nancy Clark**, MS, RD, CSSD, counsels both fitness exercisers and competitive athletes.

          "snippet": "On a somatic level, sleep is the body\u2019s most important recovery window. During deep sleep, muscle repair and protein synthesis intensify, and energy stores, including muscle glycogen, are replenished. Extended sleep deprivation significantly reduces the ability to restore glycogen, directly lowering endurance and limiting the capacity for high-intensity exercise [3]. Sleep also regulates the immune system\u2014supporting anti-inflammatory cytokine activity\u2014while its deficiency raises levels of inflammatory markers such as IL-6 and CRP, which hinder tissue repair and delay the return to peak performance [2].\n\n\u2026\n\nThe literature emphasises that extending sleep duration (\u201csleep extension\u201d) improves technical precision, reaction time, shooting accuracy, and aerobic performance, while short naps can partly compensate for nocturnal sleep deficits and support recovery [2,3,4]. Consequently, sleep is considered a key \u201crecovery window\u201d for athletes, with its insufficiency counteracting the benefits of even the most carefully designed training program [3,4].\n\n\u2026\n\nAdequate sleep and properly synchronised circadian rhythms enhance tissue repair, bone remodelling, and cellular regeneration in athletes by regulating the expression of genes involved in these regenerative processes, supporting recovery, adaptation to training, and peak performance. Conversely, sleep fragmentation, reduced sleep efficiency, or disrupted circadian cycles can impair these gene-mediated mechanisms, compromising recovery, diminishing performance, and increasing injury risk. Although all the above mechanisms of circadian rhythms and sleep can affect tissue regeneration and, consequently, the performance of athletes, it is essential to further research this area to draw firm correlations.",

          "snippet": "## Abstract\nThis study investigated the acute effects of beetroot juice (BJ) and creatine (CR) supplementation on maximal strength, heart rate variability (HRV), and muscle oxygenation during incremental resistance exercise. Eleven physically active males (age = 21.36 \u00b1 1.8 years) completed a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, crossover protocol.\n\n\u2026\n\nFrom pre- to post-session, lactate and RPE increased (p < 0.05) and lower -limb strength performance and HRV declined (p < 0.05), in all conditions, with no significant differences between BJ and CR. Compared to PLA, BJ showed significantly higher Root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), Standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), and high frequency (HF) power at both pre- and post-session (p < 0.05).\nCR supplementation resulted in significantly higher RMSSD values compared to PLA at both pre- and post-session time points (p < 0.001), while HF was significantly elevated only at post-session (p = 0.018), and SDNN showed no significant differences at either time point. Additionally, BJ revealed significantly higher RMSSD than CR at pre-session (p = 0.041). In conclusion, both BJ and CR significantly enhanced peak velocity during incremental resistance exercises compared to placebo. However, BJ provided additional benefits in muscle oxygenation and autonomic nervous system regulation, particularly during high-intensity efforts.\n\n\u2026\n\nHowever, the physiological stress imposed by resistance exercise often leads to transient impairments in performance, marked by declines in power output, muscle oxygenation, and autonomic recovery [4]. To mitigate these effects, athletes and active populations increasingly turn to ergogenic aids, such as beetroot juice (BJ) and creatine (CR), which target distinct biochemical pathways to enhance performance and accelerate recovery.\n\n\u2026\n\nInitial studies demonstrated that BJ supplementation enhances muscular endurance, strength, and ATP resynthesis efficiency while elevating plasma nitrate levels, likely via NO-mediated pathways [11, 12]. Proposed mechanisms include preferential vasodilation in type II muscle fibers, which improves blood flow and oxygen delivery during high-intensity efforts [10, 12], as well as accelerates post-exercise recovery by optimizing vascular endothelial function [13], lactate clearance [14], and blood pressure regulation [15].\n\n\u2026\n\nCR supplementation (20\u201330 g/day) increases intramuscular creatine content by up to 20%, with exercise further enhancing this effect through increased blood flow and creatine transporter (CRT) activation [22]. Studies show that exercise-induced blood flow and CRT activity enhance CR uptake in active muscles [23, 24].\n\n\u2026\n\nA single dose of CR supplementation can enhance physical performance, particularly in strength activities, by elevating intramuscular CR stores and increasing creatine phosphate availability for high-intensity exercise [25, 31]. This improves strength, power, and performance in activities like weightlifting and sprinting [32, 33]. While multiple doses are often used for full muscle saturation, a single dose, especially when timed around exercise, provides immediate benefits for short-duration, high-intensity efforts [34, 35].\n\n\u2026\n\nDespite the research on BJ and CR as individual supplements, there is a lack of direct comparisons between their acute effects on resistance training performance. Given that BJ primarily enhances oxygen delivery and muscle efficiency [10]. while creatine directly supports ATP resynthesis and anaerobic performance [36], understanding their distinct and potentially complementary effects is essential.\nThis study aimed to evaluate the impact of acute BJ vs. CR ingestion on maximal strength performance, heart rate variability (HRV), and muscle oxygenation during an incremental strength testing session. We hypothesized that acute CR supplementation would lead to greater maximal strength performance than BJ or PLA during incremental strength testing. Conversely, we hypothesized that BJ would increase muscle oxygenation and improve HRV parameters during and after exercise, but CR and PLA would produce no significant HRV changes.\n\n\u2026\n\nCR-, BJ-, and PLA-based juice were consumed in a glass shaker bottle with gradations (mL) on the side. Participants were instructed to refrain from food or drink (water was permitted ad libitum) for 2 hours before each testing session to ensure a valid estimate of the effects of intra-workout CR supplementation. To avoid any potential confounding influence of usual NO3\u2212 intake, participants were provided with a list of foods rich in NO3\u2212 (e.g., beetroot, celery, or spinach) to avoid for 48 hours before each testing session.",

To date, studies examining the sleep/wake behavior of athletes have focused on nutrition [13, 20], sleep hygiene [21], and sleep extension/napping [22, 23]. In a systematic literature review evaluating the effectiveness of sleep interventions for athletes specifically aimed at improving performance outcomes, Bonnar et al. [24] showed that sleep extension was the most beneficial intervention, while napping, sleep hygiene, and post-exercise recovery strategies provided mixed results.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Discussion\n\nSleep is widely recognized as one of the foundations for optimal health, well-being, and performance for athletes [10, 13, 57]. This systematic review synthesized the evidence regarding sleep interventions aimed at improving sleep, and whether this improvement would influence performance and/or recovery. Twenty-five studies with different sports and sleep interventions were analyzed. The findings reinforced that napping and sleep extension were the most promising sleep interventions for improved sleep and subsequent physical and/or cognitive performance.\nAll the included studies that implemented sleep extension showed a positive impact on performance outcomes (e.g., reaction time or sport-specific performance). The results showed that extending sleep duration by 46\u2013113\u00a0min (e.g., increase of 11\u201327%) over 3\u201349 nights in athletes that habitually slept\u2009~\u20097\u00a0h per night may be a logical recommendation for future sleep extension programs [37, 41, 43, 50].\n\n\u2026\n\nDuring nights of partial sleep restriction (e.g., 4 h of sleep), decreases in general performance outcomes such as muscle power or psychomotor vigilance were observed [4]. The included studies showed that napping could restore performance to baseline levels [45, 49]. With regard to nap duration, the improvements in physical and cognitive performance were greater in naps of longer duration (e.g., 90 min) compared with shorter durations (e.g., 40 min) after a normal night [35].",

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet.Introduction This fact sheet provides an overview of selected ingredients in dietary supplements designed or claimed to enhance exercise and athletic performance. Manufacturers and sellers promote these products, sometimes referred to as ergogenic aids, by claiming that they improve strength or endurance, increase exercise efficiency, achieve a performance goal more quickly, and increase tolerance for more intense training. These effects are the main focus of this fact sheet. Some people also use ergogenic aids to prepare the body for exercise, reduce the chance of injury during training, and enhance recovery from exercise [1,2]. Dietary supplements to enhance exercise and athletic performance come in a variety of forms, including tablets, capsules, liquids, powders, and bars. Many of these products contain numerous ingredients in varied combinations and amounts. Among the more common ingredients are amino acids, protein, creatine, and caffeine. According to one estimate, retail sales of the category of sports nutrition supplements totaled $5.67 billion in 2016, or 13.8% of $41.16 billion total sales for dietary supplements and related nutrition products for that year [3]. Several surveys have indicated the extent of dietary supplement use for bodybuilding and to enhance exercise and athletic performance: International surveys found that two-thirds of 3,887 adult and adolescent elite track and field athletes participating in world-championship competitions took one or more dietary supplements containing such ingredients as vitamins, minerals, creatine, caffeine, and amino acids [4]. Supplement use increased with age and was significantly more common among women than men. A survey of 1,248 students age 16 years or older in five U.S. colleges and universities in 2009\u20132010 found that 66% reported use of any dietary supplement. The reasons for use included enhanced muscle strength (20% of users), performance enhancement (19% of users), and increased endurance (7% of users) [5]. Products taken for these purposes included protein, amino acids, herbal supplements, caffeine, creatine, and combination products. In a national survey of about 21,000 U.S. college athletes, respondents reported taking protein products (41.7%), energy drinks and shots (28.6%), creatine (14.0%), amino acids (12.1%), multivitamins with caffeine (5.7%), beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB; 0.2%), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA; 0.1%), and an unspecified mix of testosterone boosters (1.6%) [6]. Men were much more likely to take performance-enhancing products than women, except for energy drinks and shots. Among the sports with the highest percentage of users of performance-enhancing products were ice hockey, wrestling, and baseball among the men and volleyball, swimming, and ice hockey among the women. In a review of studies on adolescent use of performance-enhancing substances, the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that protein, creatine, and caffeine were the most commonly used ingredients and that use increased with age [7]. Although athletes used these ingredients more than nonathletes, teenagers not involved in organized athletic activities often took them to enhance their appearance. A survey of 106,698 U.S. military personnel in 2007\u20132008 found that 22.8% of the men and 5.3% of the women reported using bodybuilding supplements, such as creatine and amino acids, and 40.5% of the men and 35.5% of the women reported using energy supplements that might contain caffeine and/or energy-enhancing herbs [8]. Use of these products was positively associated with deployment to combat situations, being younger than 29 years, being physically active, and reporting 5 or fewer hours of sleep a night. It is difficult to make generalizations about the extent of dietary supplement use by athletes because the studies on this topic are heterogeneous. However, the data suggest that [9]: A larger proportion of athletes than the general U.S. population takes dietary supplements. Elite athletes (e.g., professional athletes and those who compete on a national or international level) use dietary supplements more often than their nonelite counterparts. The supplements used by male and female athletes are similar, except that a larger proportion of women use iron and a larger proportion of men take vitamin E, protein, and creatine. For any individual to physically perform at his or her best, a nutritionally adequate diet and sufficient hydration are critical. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans [10] and MyPlate [11] recommend such an eating plan for everyone. Athletes require adequate daily amounts of calories, fluids, carbohydrates (to maintain blood glucose levels and replace muscle glycogen; typically 1.4 to 4.5 g/lb body weight [3 to 10 g/kg body weight]), protein (0.55 to 0.9 g/lb body weight [1.2 to 2.0 g/kg body weight]), fat (20% to 35% of total calories), and vitamins and minerals [12]. A few dietary supplements might enhance performance only when they add to, but do not substitute for, this dietary foundation. Athletes engaging in endurance activities lasting more than an hour or performed in extreme environments (e.g., hot temperatures or high altitudes) might need to replace lost fluids and electrolytes and consume additional carbohydrates for energy. Even with proper nutritional preparation, the results of taking any dietary supplement(s) for exercise and athletic performance vary by level of training; the nature, intensity, and duration of the activity; and the environmental conditions [13]. Sellers claim that dozens of ingredients in dietary supplements can enhance exercise and athletic performance. Well-trained elite and recreational athletes might use products containing one or more of these ingredients to train harder, improve performance, and achieve a competitive edge. However, the National Athletic Trainers' Association acknowledges in a position statement that because the outcomes of studies of various performance-enhancing substances are often equivocal, using these substances can be controversial and confusing [14]. Most studies to assess the potential value and safety of supplements to enhance exercise and athletic performance include only conditioned athletes. Therefore, it is often not clear whether the supplements discussed in this fact sheet may be of value to recreational exercisers or individuals who engage in athletic activity only occasionally. In addition, much of the research on these supplements involves young adults (more often male than female) and not adolescents who may also use them against the advice of pediatric and high-school professional associations [7,15]. The quality of many studies is limited by their small samples and short durations, use of performance tests that do not simulate real-world conditions or are unreliable or irrelevant, and poor control of confounding variables [12]. Furthermore, the benefits and risks shown for the supplements might not apply to the supplement's use to enhance types of physical performance not assessed in the studies. In most cases, additional research is needed to fully understand the efficacy and safety of particular ingredients. Selected Ingredients in Dietary Supplements for Exercise and Athletic Performance Many exercise and athletic-performance dietary supplements in the marketplace contain multiple ingredients (especially those marketed for muscle growth and strength). However, much of the research has focused only on single ingredients. One, therefore, cannot know or predict the effects and safety of combinations in these multi-ingredient products unless clinical trials have investigated that particular combination. Furthermore, the amounts of these ingredients vary widely among products. In some cases, the products contain proprietary blends of ingredients listed in order by weight, but labels do not provide the amount of each ingredient in the blend. Manufacturers and sellers of dietary supplements for exercise and athletic performance rarely fund or conduct scientific research on their proprietary products of a caliber that reputable biomedical journals require for publication. Table 1 briefly summarizes the findings discussed in more detail in this fact sheet on the safety and efficacy of selected ingredients in dietary supplements to enhance exercise and athletic performance. Some research-derived data are available on these ingredients on which to base a judgment about their potential value to aid exercise and athletic performance. These dietary supplement ingredients are listed and discussed in the table, and in the text that follows the table, in alphabetical order.

The efficacy and safety of these ingredients might be different when they are combined with other ingredients in a product or training plan. In the text below, each ingredient's section begins with an introduction, followed by a summary of the scientific evidence of that ingredient's efficacy and safety. Each section concludes with information and advice from expert sources, when available, on use of the ingredient as an ergogenic aid. Antioxidants (vitamin C, vitamin E, and coenzyme Q10) Exercise increases the body\u2019s consumption of oxygen and induces oxidative stress, leading to the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (i.e., free radicals) and the creation of more oxidized molecules in various tissues, including muscle. In theory, free radicals could impair exercise performance by impeding muscles' ability to produce force, thereby accelerating muscle damage and fatigue and producing inflammation and soreness [16-18]. Some researchers have suggested that supplements containing antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E and coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), could reduce this free-radical formation, thereby minimizing skeletal muscle damage and fatigue and promoting recovery [19]. Efficacy Studies suggest that the use of large doses of antioxidant supplements, especially vitamins C and E, may actually reduce rather than promote some of the beneficial effects of exercise. One study, for example, randomly assigned 54 healthy Norwegian men and women age 20\u201330 years, most of whom were recreational exercisers, to receive 1,000 mg vitamin C and 235 mg (about 520 IU) vitamin E as DL-alpha-tocopherol or a placebo daily for 11 weeks while engaging in an endurance training program consisting mostly of running. Compared with placebo, the supplements had no effect on maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max, a measure of aerobic fitness and endurance capacity) or running performance. However, they significantly lowered levels of biochemical markers related to mitochondrial creation and exercise-induced cell signaling, thereby diminishing the desirable training-induced adaptations within skeletal muscle [20]. The same research group conducted another trial using the same doses of vitamins C and E in 32 young men and women who followed a strength-training program for 10 weeks. Compared with placebo, the supplements did not affect muscle growth, but they significantly reduced the gain in arm strength as measured by biceps curls and blunted cellular signaling pathways linked to muscle hypertrophy [21]. Another study randomly assigned 18 young men age 20 to 34 years to receive 120 mg/day CoQ10 for 22 days or a placebo [22]. After 7 days of high-intensity cycling sprints, the CoQ10 group had, on average, a significantly smaller improvement in mean power output than the placebo group, suggesting a poorer adaptation to training. The preponderance of research to date suggests that exercise-induced reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide are beneficial. These free radicals induce adaptive changes in muscle that lead to greater production of mitochondria and hypertrophy of myofibers [17,21,23,24]. Exposure of cells to high concentrations of various antioxidant supplements (of which vitamins C and/or E have the most evidence) appears to blunt or block cell signaling and thereby inhibit some favorable physiological and physical adaptations to exercise. However, these adaptations might not prevent improvements in VO2max or endurance performance [25]. Safety Studies on the safety of vitamins C, E, and other antioxidant supplements taken during exercise show no evidence of adverse effects, aside from potentially reducing some of the benefits of exercise, but such studies have only lasted a few weeks or months. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) of vitamin C that the Food and Nutrition Board established as the maximum amount associated with little or no risk of adverse health effects is 1,800 mg/day for adolescents and 2,000 mg/day for adults [26]. These amounts are substantially higher than the doses that studies have typically used for exercise and athletic performance. The UL of vitamin E, at 800 mg/day for adolescents and 1,000 mg/day (1,100\u20131,500 IU) for adults, is likewise higher than the dose that these studies typically used [26]. Among the potential adverse effects of excess vitamin C are diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramps, and other gastrointestinal disturbances. The intake of excessive amounts of vitamin E increases the risks of hemorrhagic effects. Moreover, results from a large clinical trial show that vitamin E supplements, even at doses below the UL (400 IU/day taken for several years), might increase men's risk of prostate cancer [27]. The side effects of CoQ10 are mild and can include fatigue, insomnia, rashes, nausea, upper abdominal pain, heartburn, sensitivity to light, irritability, dizziness, and headaches [28]. Implications for use Little research supports the use as ergogenic aids of antioxidant supplements containing greater amounts than those available from a nutritionally adequate diet [19,25]. In fact, they can adversely affect some measures of exercise and athletic performance. The Australian Institute of Sport, part of the government of Australia, does not recommend supplementation with vitamins C and E by athletes, except when they use these products as part of a research protocol or with proper monitoring [29]. More information on vitamin C and vitamin E is available in the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) health professional fact sheets on these nutrients. Arginine L-arginine is an amino acid found in many protein-containing foods, especially animal products and nuts. The typical dietary intake is 4\u20135 grams/day [30]. The body also synthesizes arginine (from citrulline), mainly in the kidneys. Some experts suggest that taking arginine in supplement form enhances exercise and athletic performance in several ways [30-32]. First, some arginine is converted to nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator that can increase blood flow and the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to skeletal muscle. Second, increased vasodilation can speed up the removal of metabolic waste products related to muscle fatigue, such as lactate and ammonia, that the body produces during exercise. Third, arginine serves as a precursor for the synthesis of creatine, which helps supply muscle with energy for short-term, intense activity. Fourth, arginine may increase the secretion of human growth hormone (HGH), which in turn increases insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels, both of which stimulate muscle growth. Efficacy The research to support supplemental arginine as a performance enhancer is limited and conflicting. Overall, it suggests that doses of 2\u201320 g/day arginine have little to no effect on performance in either anaerobic or aerobic exercise [30,31]. Furthermore, arginine typically had no effect on nitric oxide concentration, blood flow, or exercise metabolites (e.g., lactate and ammonia), especially when well-trained athletes\u2014including cyclists, tennis players, and judo practitioners\u2014took the supplement for 1\u201328 days [30]. A recent review assessed 54 clinical studies examining the effects of arginine supplementation on strength performance, endurance, muscle blood volume and flow, cardiorespiratory measures, and nitric oxide production in healthy, active adults. The authors concluded that supplemental arginine (either alone or, more commonly, in combination with other ingredients, such as branched-chain amino acids [BCAAs] and lysine) provided little or no enhancement of athletic performance and did not improve recovery from exhaustion [33]. Most of the studies included few participants, primarily young men age 18\u201325 years (only four studies included women), and lasted only 4\u20138 weeks (with none lasting 3 months or longer). In the 18 studies that compared arginine alone with a placebo, the most common doses were 2\u201310 g/day as a single dose and up to 20 g/day divided into three doses. Research on the ability of supplemental arginine to raise HGH and IGF-1 serum concentrations also has had conflicting findings. Depending on the study (and therefore participants\u2019 age, fitness level, and use of other supplements as well as the nature and duration of the exercise), extra arginine might either reduce HGH secretion [34] or raise HGH and IGF-1 secretion [35]. Even raised HGH secretion, however, might not translate into more blood flow into muscle or greater protein synthesis [31]. Little evidence shows supplemental arginine by itself increases muscle creatine concentrations or is superior or complementary to direct consumption of creatine [30]. Safety Most study results suggest that up to 9 g/day arginine for several days or weeks is safe and well tolerated. At doses of 9\u201330 g/day, the most commonly reported adverse reactions are gastrointestinal discomfort, such as diarrhea and nausea, and slightly reduced blood pressure [33,36,37]. The safety of taking high-dose arginine supplements for more than 3 months is not known [33]. Implications for use Arginine supplementation\u2019s ability to enhance strength, improve exercise or athletic performance, or promote muscular recovery after exercise has little scientific support [30-33,38,39]. Beetroot or beet juice Beets are one of the richest food sources of inorganic nitrate. Ingested nitrate might enhance exercise and athletic performance in several ways, primarily through its conversion into nitric oxide in the body. Nitric acid is a potent vasodilator that can increase blood flow and the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to skeletal muscle. Ingested nitrate might also enhance performance by dilating blood vessels in exercising muscle when oxygen levels decline, thereby increasing oxygen and nutrient delivery, reducing the oxygen cost of submaximal exercise, attenuating the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-creatine phosphate energy system's cost associated with skeletal muscle force production, and improving oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria [40,41]. Beetroot is available as a juice or juice concentrate and in powdered form; the amount of nitrate can vary considerably among products. Efficacy A growing number of clinical trials investigating beetroot juice or concentrate as an ergogenic aid have been published since 2007. Beetroot has generally improved performance and endurance to different extents compared with placebo among runners, swimmers, rowers, and cyclists in time trials and time-to-exhaustion tests, but not in all studies [40,41-45]. Performance benefits are more likely in recreationally active nonathletes than elite athletes [42,46]. One study in 10 recreationally active, young male cyclists suggested a dose-response relationship [47]. Although consuming beetroot juice concentrate on each of 4 days to supply 4.2 mmol nitrate (70 ml) provided no performance benefits compared with placebo, larger amounts of juice supplying 8.4 mmol nitrate (140 ml) did. However, consumption of even more beetroot juice supplying 16.8 mmol nitrate (280 ml) produced no further performance benefits. There has been little study of the effects of beetroot on anaerobic performance, such as high-volume resistance exercise with many repetitions [40]. More research is needed to clarify the potential benefits of nitrate supplementation from beetroot juice on exercise and athletic performance and to determine the best doses and dosing protocols [48]. No research has assessed longer term supplementation with beetroot-derived nitrate beyond several weeks as an ergogenic aid. Safety Studies have not identified any safety concerns with the consumption of beetroot juice in moderate amounts (about 2 cups/day) for several weeks. The amount of nitrate that this amount of juice provides is less than half the total nitrate consumption from a diet rich in vegetables and fruits [49]. Although not a safety concern, beetroot consumption can color the urine pink or red due to the excretion of red pigments in the beets [50]. Implications for use In a position statement, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND), the Dietitians of Canada (DoC), and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) state that nitrate sources, such as beetroot juice, enhance exercise tolerance and economy and they improve endurance exercise performance in recreational athletes [12]. The Australian Institute of Sport supports the use of beetroot juice for improving sports performance in suitable athletic competitions under the direction of an expert in sports medicine, but it notes that more research might be required to understand how the supplement should be used for best results [29]. Most studies have used 500 ml/day (about 2 cups) of beetroot juice taken once (about 2.5 to 3 hours before exercise) or daily for up to 15 days [40]. This amount of juice provides about 5\u201311 mmol (or 310\u2013682 mg) nitrate, depending on the product [41]. Potential benefits persist for up to 24 hours after ingestion [40]. The labels on beetroot juice and concentrate usually indicate that these products are foods and not dietary supplements. Some dietary supplements contain beetroot powder in varying amounts, but studies have not assessed whether these are viable alternatives to beetroot juice or beetroot-juice concentrate. Beta-alanine Beta-alanine, a type of amino acid that the body does not incorporate into proteins, is the rate-limiting precursor to the synthesis of carnosine\u2014a dipeptide of histidine and beta-alanine\u2014in skeletal muscle. Carnosine helps buffer changes in muscle pH from the anaerobic glycolysis that provides energy during high-intensity exercise but results in the buildup of hydrogen ions as lactic acid accumulates and dissociates to form lactate, leading to reduced force and to fatigue [51]. More carnosine in muscle leads to greater potential attenuation of exercise-induced reductions in pH, which could enhance performance of intense activities of short to moderate duration, such as rowing and swimming [52]. Beta-alanine is produced in the liver, and relatively small amounts are present in animal-based foods such as meat, poultry, and fish. Estimated dietary intakes range from none in vegans to about 1 g/day in heavy meat eaters [52]. Carnosine is present in animal-based foods, such as beef and pork. However, oral consumption of carnosine is an inefficient method of increasing muscle carnosine concentrations because the dipeptide is digested into its constituent amino acids. Consumption of beta-alanine, in contrast, reliably increases the amount of carnosine in the body. Four to six grams of beta-alanine for 10 weeks, for example, can increase muscle carnosine levels by up to 80%, especially in trained athletes, although the magnitude of response differs widely [53,54]. For example, in one study of young, physically active but untrained adult men who took 4.8 g/day beta-alanine for 5\u20136 weeks, the percent increase in muscle carnosine content after 9 weeks of follow-up ranged from 2% to 69% [55]. Among the low responders, the duration of the washout period when beta alanine concentrations returned to baseline values was less than half that for the high responders (6 weeks vs. 15 weeks). Efficacy Studies have evaluated beta-alanine as a potential ergogenic aid with a variety of participants, exercise and activity protocols, and dosing regimens. Some studies suggest that beta-alanine consumption could provide small performance benefits in competitive events requiring high-intensity effort over a short period, such as rowing, swimming, and team sports (e.g., hockey and football) that involve repeated sprints and intermittent activity [52]. Other studies have found no such benefits [53]. Evidence is conflicting on whether beta-alanine consumption improves performance in endurance activities, such as cycling [53,56]. Experts have not reached consensus on whether beta-alanine consumption primarily benefits trained athletes or recreationally active individuals [53,57]. Studies provide little consistent evidence of a relationship between the dose of beta-alanine and performance effect [51,58]. The authors of a Department of Defense-sponsored review concluded that the limited evidence from 20 human trials did not support consumption of beta-alanine (alone or in combination products) by active adults to enhance athletic performance or improve recovery from exercise-related exhaustion [59]. Most of the studies in this review included young men age 18\u201325 years who took 1.6\u20136.4 g/day beta-alanine supplements (in two to four separate servings) over 4\u20138 weeks. In contrast, the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) concluded from its literature review that beta-alanine supplements (4\u20136 g/day consumed for at least 2\u20134 weeks) can improve high-intensity exercise performance that lasts more than 60 seconds, especially in time-to-exhaustion tasks [54]. However, performance benefits are more modest in exercise tests lasting more than 4 minutes because aerobic metabolic pathways increasingly meet energy demands. The ISSN called for more research to determine whether beta-alanine increases the strength and muscle mass that regular resistance exercise, such as weightlifting, can produce. The authors of the most recent review of studies on beta-alanine's effects on exercise concluded that supplementation has a statistically significant and positive effect on performance (including in both isolated-limb and whole-body exercises), especially in protocols lasting 30 seconds to 10 minutes [58]. However, this review also highlighted the fact that small studies of short duration using varied exercise and supplement protocols dominate this scientific literature. The 40 placebo-controlled studies reviewed, for example, employed 65 exercise protocols and 70 exercise measures in a total of 1,461 participants. Furthermore, the total dose of beta-alanine that participants consumed ranged from 84 to 414 g in studies lasting 28\u201390 days. Safety Beta-alanine supplementation appears to be safe at 1.6\u20136.4 g/day for up to 8 weeks [54]. Some evidence does show, however, that consuming a conventional dose of beta-alanine of at least 800 mg or exceeding 10 mg/kg body mass can provoke moderate to severe paresthesia [54,59]. This tingling, prickling, or burning sensation is common in the face, neck, back of the hands, and upper trunk and typically lasts 60\u201390 minutes but is not a painful, serious, or harmful reaction. Use of divided doses or a sustained-release form of the supplement can attenuate paresthesia resulting from beta-alanine consumption [52,54]. Some research has also found that beta-alanine supplements can produce pruritus (itchy skin), but the authors do not indicate the severity of this effect [59]. There are no safety data on use of the supplement for more than 1 year [54,60]. Implications for use There is insufficient expert consensus on the value of taking beta-alanine to enhance performance in intense, short-term activities or its safety, particularly when users take it regularly for at least several months. In a position statement, the AND, DoC, and ACSM advise that beta-alanine supplementation might improve training capacity and does enhance performance, especially of high-intensity exercise lasting 60\u2013240 seconds, that acid-base disturbances resulting from increased anaerobic glycolysis would otherwise impair [12]. In its position statement, the ISSN concludes that beta-alanine supplementation improves exercise performance and attenuates neuromuscular fatigue [54]. The Australian Institute of Sport supports the use of beta-alanine for improving sports performance in suitable athletic competitions under the direction of an expert in sports medicine, but it notes that more research might be required to understand how the supplement should be used for best results [29]. For healthy individuals willing to use beta-alanine supplements, the ISSN recommends a daily loading dose of 4 to 6 g/day in divided doses of 2 g or less for at least 2 weeks. The society states that benefits increase after 4 weeks, when muscle carnosine concentrations rise by 40%\u201360% [54]. It advises users to take beta-alanine supplements with meals to augment muscle carnosine levels and to use divided lower doses or take a sustained-release form if paresthesia occurs. Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate HMB is a metabolite of the branched-chain amino acid leucine. About 5% of the body\u2019s leucine is converted into HMB, which is then converted in the liver to a precursor (known as beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) needed for cholesterol biosynthesis [61]. Some experts hypothesize that skeletal muscle cells that become stressed and damaged from exercise require an exogenous source of the coenzyme for synthesis of cholesterol in their cellular membranes to restore structure and function [62,63]. Experts also believe that the conversion of leucine to HMB activates muscle protein synthesis and reduces protein breakdown [63]. Supplementation is the only practical way to obtain 3 g/day HMB because one would otherwise need to consume more than 600 g/day of high-quality protein (from 5 lb of beef tenderloin, for example) to obtain enough leucine (60 g) for conversion into HMB [63]. Efficacy Although studies have investigated HMB for two decades, they have used substantially different periods of supplementation (1 day to 6 weeks) and daily doses (1.5 to 6 g; most commonly 3 g based on evidence that this dose provides equivalent results to 6 g and better results than 1.5 g) [61,63,64]. Studies also used participants of different ages (19 to 50 years), training status (e.g., untrained or trained athletes), training protocols (e.g., with machines or free weights), training duration (10 days to 12 weeks), consumption of other supplements (such as creatine), and other factors. It is therefore difficult to predict what, if any, benefits an exercising individual might experience from consuming HMB. There is general agreement that HMB helps speed up recovery from exercise of sufficient amount and intensity to induce skeletal muscle damage [63,65]. Therefore, trained athletes must exert themselves more than untrained individuals to potentially benefit from using the supplement. Some studies suggest that HMB use has additional benefits, including an ability to enhance strength, power, skeletal muscle hypertrophy, and aerobic performance in both trained and untrained people [63]. Safety A review of safety data from nine studies found that users tolerate HMB well, and it is safe at daily intakes of 3 g for 3 to 8 weeks in younger (ages 18\u201347 years) and older (ages 62\u201381) adults of both sexes who do or do not exercise [66]. Assessments of blood chemistry, hematology, and emotional affect found no adverse effects. Another study randomized 37 untrained males age 18\u201329 years participating in a resistance training program to take either no HMB or about 3\u20136 g/day HMB [62]. Use of HMB did not alter or adversely affect any measured hematologic, hepatic, or renal-function parameters in these young men. Although 3 g/day HMB appears to be safe for short-term use in adults, its safety profile (and efficacy) has not been studied in adolescents [63]. Implications for use There is no expert consensus on the value of taking HMB for several months or longer or its safety. HMB is not on a list of evidence-based ergogenic aids issued by the AND, DoC, and the ACSM [12]. The Australian Institute of Sport does not recommend HMB supplementation by athletes, except as part of a research protocol or with proper monitoring [29]. However, the ISSN notes that HMB can enhance recovery by reducing exercise-induced skeletal muscle damage in both trained and untrained individuals [63]. HMB is available in two forms: as a mono-hydrated calcium salt (HMB-Ca) and a calcium-free form (HMB-free acid [HMB-FA]). HMB-Ca is approximately 13% calcium by weight, and a daily dose of 3 g/day adds about 400 mg calcium to the diet [66]. Those who wish to limit their calcium intake can use HMB-FA [63]. Although the latter form appears to have a faster and greater effect based on its ability to raise HMB plasma levels, more studies are needed to compare the effects of HMB-Ca with those of HMB-FA [63]. The ISSN recommends that healthy adults interested in using HMB supplements take 1\u20132 g HMB-Ca 60 to 120 minutes before exercise or 1\u20132 g HMB-FA 30 to 60 minutes before exercise [63]. It also suggests that supplement users ideally consume 3 g/day HMB (in three equal servings of 1 g) for at least 2 weeks before high-intensity exercise to optimize HMB\u2019s protective effects on muscle. Betaine Betaine, also known as trimethylglycine, is found in foods such as beets, spinach, and whole-grain breads. Average daily intakes of betaine range from 100 to 300 mg/day [67]. The mechanisms by which betaine might enhance exercise and athletic performance are not known, but many are hypothesized. For example, betaine might increase the biosynthesis of creatine, levels of blood nitric acid, and/or the water retention of cells [68]. Efficacy A limited number of small studies in men have assessed betaine in supplemental form as a potential ergogenic aid. These studies, which typically examined strength- and power-based performance in bodybuilders and, occasionally, cyclists, provided conflicting results, and performance improvements tended to be modest [68-71]. The typical dose of betaine that studies used ranged from 2 to 5 g/day [71] for up to 15 days. Safety The several small studies of athletes described in the previous paragraph who took betaine supplements for up to several weeks found no side effects or safety concerns. However, research has not adequately evaluated the safety of betaine. Implications for use More research on betaine supplementation to enhance various types of performance, training protocols, and exercise during specific sports is needed before any recommendations for its use can be made [71]. Branched-chain amino acids Three essential amino acids (EAAs)\u2014leucine, isoleucine, and valine\u2014are the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), whose name reflects their chemical structure. BCAAs make up approximately 25% of the amino acids in foods containing complete proteins (including all EAAs) [72]; most of these foods are animal products, such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and milk (see section on protein). BCAAs comprise about 14%\u201318% of the amino acids in human skeletal muscle proteins [73]. Unlike other EAAs, the BCAAs can be metabolized by mitochondria in skeletal muscle to provide energy during exercise [74,75]. The BCAAs, especially leucine, might also stimulate protein synthesis in exercised muscle [72,76]. Efficacy The limited research on the potential ergogenic effects of the BCAAs has found little evidence to date that supplements of these amino acids improve performance in endurance-related aerobic events [75]. The BCAAs might delay feelings of fatigue or help maintain mental focus by competing with the amino acid tryptophan (a precursor of the neurotransmitter serotonin that regulates mood and sleep) for entry into the brain, but this effect has not been well studied [72,74,75]. The results of several short-term studies lasting about 3 to 6 weeks suggest that about 10\u201314 g/day supplemental BCAAs might enhance gains in muscle mass and strength during training [1]. Overall, however, studies to date provide inconsistent evidence of the ability of BCAAs to stimulate muscle protein synthesis beyond the capacity of sufficient dietary amounts of any high-quality protein to perform this function [76]. Furthermore, it is not clear from existing research whether consumption of protein and BCAAs before versus after a workout affects their ability to maximize muscle protein synthesis and reduce protein catabolism [12,77-79]. Safety Up to 20 g/day BCAA supplements in divided doses appear to be safe [75]. For leucine alone, studies suggest an upper safe limit of intake of 500 mg/kg per day in healthy young and elderly men, or about 38 g/day for a man weighing 75 kg (165 lb) [80-82]. Implications for use Studies have not consistently shown that taking supplements of BCAAs or any of their three constituent amino acids singly enhances exercise and athletic performance, builds muscle mass, or aids in recovery from exercise. Consuming animal foods containing complete proteins\u2014or a combination of plant-based foods with complementary proteins that together provide all EAAs\u2014automatically increases consumption of BCAAs (see section on protein). This is also true of consuming protein powders made from complete proteins, especially whey, which has more leucine than either casein or soy [78]. Caffeine Caffeine is a methylated xanthine naturally found in variable amounts in coffee; tea; cacao pods (the source of chocolate); and other herbal/botanical sources, such as guarana, kola (or cola) nut, and yerba mate. Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system, muscles, and other organs such as the heart by binding to adenosine receptors on cells, thereby blocking the activity of adenosine, a neuromodulator with sedative-like properties [83,84]. In this way, caffeine enhances arousal, increases vigor, and reduces fatigue [13,85,86]. Caffeine also appears to reduce perceived pain and exertion [13,85]. During the early stages of endurance exercise, caffeine might mobilize free fatty acids as a source of energy and spare muscle glycogen [38]. Caffeine is commonly used in energy drinks and shots touted for their performance-enhancement effects [87,88]. It is also found in energy gels containing carbohydrates and electrolytes as well as in anhydrous caffeine-only pills. Efficacy Many studies have shown that caffeine might enhance performance in athletes when they ingest about 2\u20136 mg/kg body weight before exercise by improving endurance, strength, and power in high-intensity team sports activities [13,85,89,90]. For an individual weighing 154 pounds (70 kg), this dose is equivalent to 210\u2013420 mg caffeine. Taking more, however, is unlikely to improve performance further and increases the risk of side effects. A review of the literature found that caffeine intake affected sport-specific performance (e.g., running, cycling, swimming, and rowing), as measured in time trials. Although 30 of the 33 trials showed positive improvements in performance, the improvements were not statistically significant in half of them [85]. In these studies, performance improvement ranged from a decrease of 0.7% to an increase of 17.3%, suggesting that the caffeine was very helpful to some participants but slightly impaired performance in others. Factors such as the timing of ingestion, caffeine intake mode or form, and habituation to caffeine could also have accounted for the varied effects on performance. Caffeine supplementation is more likely to help with endurance-type activities (such as running) and activities of long duration with intermittent activity (such as soccer) than more anaerobic, short-term bouts of intense exercise (such as sprinting or lifting weights) [91]. Some evidence suggests that caffeine is more likely to improve performance in people who are not habituated to it [85]. Limiting caffeine intake to 50 mg/day or abstaining from caffeine for 2\u20137 days before taking it for an athletic event might maximize any ergogenic effect. However, other evidence shows no habituation effect of caffeine consumption on performance [92]. Safety Heavy caffeine use (500 mg/day or more) might diminish rather than enhance physical performance and could also disturb sleep and cause irritability and anxiety [93]. Other adverse effects of caffeine include insomnia, restlessness, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, and arrhythmia [94-97]. Caffeine does not induce diuresis or increase sweat loss during exercise and therefore does not reduce fluid balance in the body that would adversely affect performance [13,90,98]. For healthy adults, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) states that 400 mg/day caffeine does not usually have dangerous adverse effects [99]. The American Medical Association recommends that adults limit their intake of caffeine to 500 mg/day and that adolescents consume no more than 100 mg/day [100]. The American Academy of Pediatrics warns that caffeine-containing energy drinks in particular have no place in the diets of children or adolescents and are not suitable for use during routine physical activity [101]. Pure powdered caffeine is available as a dietary supplement and is very potent. A single tablespoon contains 10 g caffeine, and an acute oral dose of 10 to 14 g caffeine (approximately 150\u2013200 mg/kg) can be fatal [91]. Furthermore, combining caffeine with other stimulants could increase the potential for adverse effects [94]. At least two young men have died as a result of taking an unknown amount of pure powdered caffeine [102]. Implications for use Caffeine is easily and rapidly absorbed, even from the buccal membranes in the mouth, and is distributed throughout the body and brain. It reaches peak concentrations in the blood within 45 minutes of consumption and has a half-life of about 4\u20135 hours [83]. For a potential benefit to athletic performance, users should consume caffeine 15 to 60 minutes before exercise [13,85]. Consumption of caffeine with fluid during exercise of long duration might extend any performance improvements [85]. In a position statement, the AND, DoC, and ACSM state that caffeine supplementation reduces perceived fatigue and enables users to sustain exercise at the desired intensity longer [12]. The U.S. Department of Defense states that caffeine supplementation at 2\u20136 mg/kg body weight is linked to enhanced physical performance and the effects of smaller doses usually last longer and are greater in people who do not usually consume caffeine [89]. It adds that caffeine could reduce perceived exertion when exercise lasts longer. In a position statement, the ISSN describes caffeine as effective in trained athletes for improving sports performance and notes that supplementation with about 3\u20136 mg/kg has an ergogenic effect on sustained maximal endurance exercise but not necessarily on strength-power performance [13]. The Australian Institute of Sport supports the use of caffeine for improving sports performance in suitable athletic competitions under the direction of an expert in sports medicine, but it notes that more research might be required to understand how caffeine should be used for best results [29]. The International Olympic Committee considers caffeine to be a controlled or restricted substance; Olympic athletes may consume it until urinary concentrations exceed 12 mcg/ml [103]. The National Collegiate Athletic Association prohibits use of caffeine from any source in amounts that would lead to urine concentrations exceeding 15 mcg/ml [104,105]. (Consuming about 500 mg caffeine produces a urinary caffeine concentration of 15 mcg/ml within 2\u20133 hours [106].) The World Anti-Doping Agency does not prohibit or limit caffeine use [107]. Citrulline L-citrulline is a nonessential amino acid produced in the body, mainly from glutamine, and obtained from the diet. Watermelon is the best-known source; 1 cup diced seedless watermelon has about 365 mg citrulline [108]. About 80% of the body's citrulline is converted in the kidneys into arginine, another amino acid (see section on arginine) [30]. The subsequent conversion of arginine to nitric oxide, a potent dilator of blood vessels, might be the mechanism by which citrulline could serve as an ergogenic aid. In fact, consumption of citrulline might be a more efficient way to raise blood arginine levels than consumption of arginine because more citrulline is absorbed from the gut than arginine. Most studies have used citrulline malate, a combination of citrulline with malic acid (a constituent in many fruits that is also produced endogenously), because malate, an intermediate in the Krebs cycle, might enhance energy production [30]. Efficacy The research to support supplemental citrulline as an ergogenic aid is limited and conflicting at best. The few published studies have had heterogeneous designs and ranged in duration from 1 to 16 days. As an example, in one randomized controlled study with a crossover design, 41 healthy male weightlifters age 22\u201337 years consumed 8 g citrulline malate or a placebo 1 hour before completing barbell bench presses to exhaustion [109]. Overall, participants could complete significantly more repetitions when taking the supplement and reported significantly less muscle soreness 1 and 2 days after the test. Another study that randomized 17 young healthy men and women to take citrulline without malate (either 3 g before testing or 9 g over 24 hours) or a placebo found that participants using the citrulline did not perform as well as those taking the placebo on an incremental treadmill test to exhaustion [110]. Although citrulline supplementation might increase plasma levels of nitric oxide metabolites, such a response has not been directly related to any improvement in athletic performance [30]. Safety Studies have not adequately assessed the safety of citrulline, particularly when users take it in supplemental form for months at a time. In the study of weight lifters described above, 6 of the 41 participants reported stomach discomfort after taking the supplement [109]. Additional short-term studies in which supplemental citrulline was provided to nonathletes at up to 6 g/day for 4 weeks and 1.35 g/day for 6 weeks found no adverse effects [111]. Implications for use The research to date does not provide strong support for taking citrulline or citrulline malate to enhance exercise or athletic performance [30]. Whether athletes in specific sports or activities might benefit from taking supplemental citrulline remains to be determined [109]. Dietary supplements that contain citrulline provide either citrulline or citrulline malate. Citrulline malate is 56.64% citrulline by weight so, for example, 1 g citrulline malate provides 566 mg of citrulline. Sellers of some citrulline malate dietary supplements claim that they provide a higher percentage of citrulline (with labels listing, for example, citrulline malate 2:1 or tri-citrulline malate), but studies have not determined whether these supplements are superior to standard citrulline or citrulline malate supplements. Creatine Creatine is one of the most thoroughly studied and widely used dietary supplements to enhance exercise and sports performance [112]. Creatine is produced endogenously and obtained from the diet in small amounts. It helps generate ATP and thereby supplies the muscles with energy, particularly for short-term events [113]. Creatine might improve muscle performance in four ways: by increasing stores of phosphocreatine used to generate ATP at the beginning of intense exercise, accelerating the re-synthesis of phosphocreatine after exercise, depressing the degradation of adenine nucleotides and the accumulation of lactate, and/or enhancing glycogen storage in skeletal muscles [113]. The liver and kidneys synthesize about 1 g/day creatine from the amino acids glycine, arginine, and methionine [114]. Animal-based foods, such as beef (2 g/lb), pork (2.3 g/lb), and salmon (2 g/lb), also contain creatine. A person weighing 154 pounds has about 120 g creatine and phosphocreatine in his or her body, almost all in the skeletal and cardiac muscles [112]. However, it is only when users consume much greater amounts of creatine over time as a dietary supplement that it could have ergogenic effects. Metabolized creatine is converted into the waste product creatinine, which is eliminated from the body through the kidneys. Efficacy Studies in both laboratory and sports settings have found that short-term creatine supplementation (for 5 to 7 days) in both men and women often significantly increases strength (e.g., for bench presses) and power (e.g., for cycling), work involving multiple sets of maximal effort muscle contractions, and sprinting and soccer performance [112,115]. In one example, a study randomized 14 healthy, resistance-trained men (age 19\u201329 years) to receive 25 g creatine monohydrate or a placebo for 6\u20137 days [116]. Participants taking the supplement had significant improvements in peak power output during all five sets of jump squats and in repetitions during all five sets of bench presses on three occasions. In another study, 18 well-trained male sprinters age 18\u201324 years received either 20 g/day creatine or a placebo for 5 days [117]. Compared with those taking the placebo, participants taking the creatine improved their performance in both 100-meter sprints and six intermittent 60-m sprints. Supplementation with creatine over weeks or months helps training adaptations to structured, increased workloads over time. For example, in a randomized study of 14 female collegiate soccer players during the off-season, those who received creatine (15 g/day for 1 week and then 5 g/day for 12 weeks) had significantly greater increases in muscle strength, as measured by bench press and full-squat maximal strength testing, but not lean tissue compared with participants who took a placebo [118]. Individuals have varied responses to creatine supplementation, based on factors such as diet and the relative percentages of various muscle fiber types [114,119]. Vegetarians, for example, with their lower muscle creatine content, might have greater responses to supplementation than meat eaters. Overall, creatine enhances performance during repeated short bursts of high-intensity, intermittent activity, such as sprinting and weight lifting, where energy for this predominantly anaerobic exercise comes mainly from the ATP-creatine phosphate energy system [38,114]. Creatine supplementation seems to be of little value for endurance sports, such as distance running or swimming, that do not depend on the short-term ATP-creatine phosphate system to provide short-term energy, and it leads to weight gain that might impede performance in such sports [113,114]. Furthermore, in predominantly aerobic exercise lasting more than 150 seconds, the body relies on oxidative phosphorylation as the primary energy source, a metabolic pathway that does not require creatine [114]. Safety Studies have found no consistent set of side effects from creatine use, except that it often leads to weight gain, because it increases water retention and possibly stimulates muscle protein synthesis [112,113]. Several studies have found that supplemental creatine monohydrate, when used for a strength-training program, can lead to a 1\u20132 kg increase in total body weight in a month [73]. Creatine is considered safe for short-term use by healthy adults [12,112,113,114]. In addition, evidence shows that use of the product for several years is safe [112,120-122]. Anecdotal reactions to creatine use include nausea, diarrhea and related gastrointestinal distress, muscle cramps, and heat intolerance. Creatine supplementation may reduce the range of motion of various parts of the body (such as the shoulders, ankles, and lower legs) and lead to muscle stiffness and resistance to stretching [114]. Adequate hydration while taking creatine might minimize these uncommon risks [113]. Implications for use In a position statement, the AND, DoC, and ACSM advise that creatine enhances performance of cycles of high-intensity exercise followed by short recovery periods and improves training capacity [12]. In its position statement, the ISSN states that creatine monohydrate is the most effective nutritional supplement currently available for enhancing capacity for high-intensity exercise and lean body mass during exercise [112]. The ISSN contends that athletes who supplement with creatine have a lower incidence of injuries and exercise-related side effects compared to those who do not take creatine [112]. The Australian Institute of Sport supports the use of creatine for improving sports performance in suitable athletic competitions under the direction of an expert in sports medicine, but it notes that more research might be required to understand how the supplement should be used for best results [29]. A typical protocol for creatine supplementation in adults, regardless of sex or body size, consists of a loading phase for 5\u20137 days, when users consume 20 g/day creatine monohydrate in four portions of 5 g, followed by a maintenance phase of 3\u20135 g/day [112-114]. In some studies, the loading dose is based on body weight (e.g., 0.3 g/kg) [114]. Another creatine supplementation protocol consists of taking single doses of about 3\u20136 g/day (0.03\u20130.1 g/kg body weight) for 3 to 4 weeks, without a loading phase, to produce ergogenic effects [112,114,119]. Creatine monohydrate, which is 88% creatine by weight, is the most widely used and studied form [112,114,123]. Other, usually more expensive, forms of creatine (e.g., creatine ethyl ester, creatine alpha-ketoglutarate, and buffered forms of creatine) have not been proven to have superior ability to creatine monohydrate for enhancing muscle creatine levels, digestibility, product stability, or safety [73,112,123]. Deer antler velvet Deer antler velvet consists of cartilage and epidermis from growing deer or elk antlers before ossification [124,125]. It is used as a general health aid in traditional Chinese medicine. Several growth factors have been detected in deer antler velvet, such as IGF-1, that could promote muscle tissue growth in a similar way to the quick growth of deer antlers. Efficacy Three randomized controlled trials in a total of 95 young and middle-age men and 21 young females provide virtually no evidence that deer antler velvet supplements improve aerobic or anaerobic performance, muscular strength, or endurance [125,126]. One of the trials randomized 38 active men age 19\u201324 years to take 300 mg/d of a deer-antler-velvet extract, 1.5 g/d of a deer-antler-velvet powder, or a placebo and begin a strength- and endurance-training program [126]. The supplements provided no significant ergogenic effects compared with placebo. Safety Studies have not adequately assessed the safety of deer antler velvet. The studies cited above found no side effects in participants taking deer-antler-velvet supplements. IGF-1 is available as a prescription medication, and its reported side effects include hypoglycemia, headache, edema, and joint pain [127]. An evaluation of six deer-antler-velvet dietary supplements that were commercially available in 2013 found that five of them contained no deer IGF-1, and four were adulterated with human IGF-1 [124]. Only one of the six supplements contained a low level of deer IGF-1. Implications for use The research to date does not support taking deer-antler-velvet supplements to enhance exercise or athletic performance. The National Collegiate Athletic Association [105] and the World Anti-Doping Agency [128] ban the use of IGF-1 and its analogues in athletic competition. Dehydroepiandrosterone DHEA is a steroid hormone secreted by the adrenal cortex. The body can convert DHEA to the male hormone testosterone; testosterone's intermediary, androstenedione; and the female hormone estradiol [129]. Testosterone is an anabolic steroid that promotes gains in muscle mass and strength when combined with resistance training [130]. Efficacy The minimal research on DHEA's use to enhance exercise and athletic performance provides no evidence of benefit [129]. One study, for example, randomly assigned 40 male weightlifters (average age 48 years) to receive DHEA (100 mg/day), androstenedione (100 mg/day), or a placebo for 12 weeks while continuing their training programs. Compared to placebo, the DHEA and androstenedione produced no statistically significant increase in strength, aerobic capacity, lean body mass, or testosterone levels [131]. Another study randomly assigned 20 sedentary men 19\u201329 years of age to receive either 150 mg/day DHEA or a placebo for 6 of 8 weeks in combination with a resistance-training program. The supplement provided no benefits compared with placebo in increasing muscle strength, lean body mass, or testosterone concentrations [130]. Safety Studies have not adequately assessed the safety of DHEA. The two short-term studies in men described above found no side effects from the DHEA; blood lipid levels and liver function remained normal. Other studies have found that in women, use of DHEA for months significantly raises serum testosterone but not estrogen levels, which can cause acne and growth of facial hair [129]. Implications for use The research to date does not support taking DHEA supplements to enhance exercise or athletic performance. The National Collegiate Athletic Association and the World Anti-Doping Agency ban the use of DHEA [105,128]. Ginseng Ginseng is a generic term for botanicals from the genus Panax. Some popular varieties are known as Chinese, Korean, American, and Japanese ginseng. Preparations made from ginseng roots have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for millennia as a tonic to improve stamina and vitality [132]. So-called Siberian or Russian ginseng (Eleutherococcus senticosus), although unrelated to Panax ginseng, has also been used in traditional Chinese medicine to combat fatigue and strengthen the immune system [133]. Efficacy Numerous small studies, with and without placebo controls, have investigated Panax ginseng's potential to improve the physical performance of athletes, regular and occasional exercisers, and largely sedentary individuals. In almost all cases, the studies found that Panax ginseng in various doses and preparations had no ergogenic effect on such measures as peak power output, time to exhaustion, perceived exertion, recovery from intense activity, oxygen consumption, or heart rate [132,134-136]. One review of studies of the effects of Siberian ginseng on endurance performance found that the five studies with the most rigorous research protocols (with a total of 55 men and 24 women) showed no effect of supplementation for up to 6 weeks on exercise performed for up to 120 minutes [133]. A subsequent randomized controlled trial using a crossover design with nine male college tennis players found that 800 mg/day Siberian ginseng (prepared from the root and rhizome) for 8 weeks significantly improved endurance in a cycling trial, elevated VO2max and heart rate, and increased fat oxidation [137]. Safety Short-term Panax ginseng use appears to be safe; the most commonly reported adverse effects include headache, sleep disturbances, and gastrointestinal disorders [136]. Short-term Siberian ginseng use also appears to be safe. The studies cited above reported no adverse effects, although other reports of clinical trials have listed insomnia as a rare side effect [138]. Implications for use The research to date provides little support for taking ginseng to enhance exercise or athletic performance [132,136]. Glutamine Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in muscle, blood, and the body\u2019s free-amino-acid pool. It is synthesized in the body primarily from the BCAAs, and an adult consumes about 3\u20136 g/day in protein-containing foods [139,140]. Glutamine is a key molecule in metabolism and energy production, and it contributes nitrogen for many critical biochemical reactions [141]. It is an EAA for critically ill patients when the body's need for glutamine exceeds its capacity to produce sufficient amounts. Efficacy Few studies have examined the effect of glutamine supplementation alone as an ergogenic aid [142]. One study randomized 31 male and female weightlifters to receive either glutamine (0.9 g/kg lean body mass, or almost 45 g/day) or placebo while completing a 6-week strength-training program. There were no significant differences between the two groups in measures of strength, torque, or lean tissue mass, demonstrating that glutamine had no effect on muscle performance, body composition, or muscle-protein degradation. Another study compared the effect of glutamine (four doses of 0.3 g/kg body weight over 3 days) or placebo in 16 young adult men and women on recovery from eccentric exercise consisting of unilateral knee extensions [143]. Supplementation with glutamine reduced the magnitude of strength loss, accelerated strength recovery, and diminished muscle soreness more quickly than placebo; these effects were more pronounced in the men. Some athletes use glutamine supplements in the hope that they will attenuate exercise-induced immune impairment and reduce their risk of developing upper respiratory tract infections. However, there is little research-based support for this benefit [140,141]. Safety In the studies described above, the glutamine had no reported side effects. Many patients with serious catabolic illnesses, such as infections, intestinal diseases, and burns, take glutamine safely as part of their medical care. Daily oral doses ranging from 0.21 to 0.42 g/kg body weight glutamine (equivalent to 15\u201330 g/day in a person weighing 154 pounds) have provided no biochemical or clinical evidence of toxicity [139]. Implications for use The research to date does not support taking glutamine alone to improve exercise and athletic performance [139,140]. Iron Iron is an essential mineral and a structural component of hemoglobin, an erythrocyte protein that transfers oxygen from the lungs to the tissues, and myoglobin, a protein in muscles that provides them with oxygen. Iron is also necessary to metabolize substrates for energy as a component of cytochromes and to dehydrogenase enzymes involved in substrate oxidation [144]. Iron deficiency impairs oxygen-carrying capacity and muscle function, and it limits people's ability to exercise and be active [12,145]. Its detrimental effects can include fatigue and lethargy, lower aerobic capacity, and slower times in performance trials [146]. Iron balance is an important consideration for athletes who must pay attention to both iron intakes and iron losses. Teenage girls and premenopausal women are at increased risk of obtaining insufficient amounts of iron from their diets. They require more iron than teenage boys and men because they lose considerable iron due to menstruation, and they might not eat sufficient amounts of iron-containing foods [147,148]. Athletes of both sexes lose additional iron for several reasons [145,146,149,150]. Physical activity produces acute inflammation that reduces iron absorption from the gut and iron use via a peptide, hepcidin, that regulates iron homeostasis. Iron is also lost in sweat. The destruction of erythrocytes in the feet because of frequent striking on hard surfaces leads to foot-strike hemolysis. Also, use of anti-inflammatories and pain medications can lead to some blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract, thereby decreasing iron stores. The richest dietary sources of heme iron (which is highly bioavailable) include lean meats and seafood. Plant-based foods\u2014such as nuts, beans, vegetables, and fortified grain products\u2014contain nonheme iron, which is less bioavailable than heme iron. Efficacy Although iron deficiency anemia decreases work capacity, there is conflicting evidence on whether milder iron deficiency without anemia impairs sport and exercise performance [12,151,152]. One systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether iron treatments (provided orally or by injection) improved iron status and aerobic capacity in iron-deficient but nonanemic endurance athletes identified 19 studies involving 80 men and 363 women with a mean age of 22 years. Iron treatments improved iron status as expected, but they did not guarantee improvement in aerobic capacity or indices of endurance performance [153]. Another systematic review and meta-analysis compared the effects of iron supplementation with no supplementation on exercise performance in women of reproductive age [149]. Most of the 24 studies identified were small (i.e., they randomly assigned fewer than 20 women to a treatment or control group) and had a risk of bias. Based on the limited data and heterogenicity of results, the study authors suggested that preventing and treating iron deficiency could improve the performance of female athletes in sports that require endurance, maximal power output, and strength. Safety Athletes can safely obtain recommended intakes of iron by consuming a healthy diet containing iron-rich foods and by taking an iron-containing dietary supplement as needed. High doses of iron may be prescribed for several weeks or months to treat iron deficiency, especially if anemia is present. The UL for iron is 45 mg/day for men and women age 14 and older and 40 mg/day for younger children [147]. Acute intakes of more than 20 mg/kg iron from supplements or medicines can lead to gastric upset, constipation, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and fainting, especially if users do not consume food at the same time [147,150]. Individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis, which predisposes them to absorb excessive amounts of dietary and supplemental iron, have an increased risk of iron overload [154]. Implications for use Correcting iron deficiency anemia improves work capacity, but there is conflicting evidence on whether milder iron deficiency without anemia impairs athletic performance. In a position statement, the AND, DoC, and ACSM do not recommend routine supplementation of iron except in response to a health care provider\u2019s instruction and note that such supplementation is only ergogenic if the individual has iron depletion [12]. Furthermore, they warn that iron supplementation can cause gastrointestinal side effects. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for iron is 11 mg for teenage boys and 15 mg for teenage girls [147]. The RDA is 8 mg for men and 18 mg for women age 50 and younger, and 8 mg for older adults of both sexes. Individuals who engage in intense exercise might require 30% to 70% more iron than moderately active and sedentary people [147]. Recommended intakes of iron for vegetarians and vegans are 1.8 times higher than for people who eat meat [147]. More information on iron and the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia is available in the ODS health professional fact sheet on iron. Protein Protein is necessary to build, maintain, and repair muscle. Exercise increases intramuscular protein oxidation and breakdown, after which muscle-protein synthesis increases for up to a day or two [155]. Regular resistance exercise results in the accretion of myofibrillar protein (the predominant proteins in skeletal muscle) and an increase in skeletal muscle fiber size. Aerobic exercise leads to more modest protein accumulation in working muscle, primarily in the mitochondria, which enhances oxidative capacity (oxygen use) for future workouts [155,156]. Athletes must consider both protein quality and quantity to meet their needs for the nutrient. They must obtain EAAs from the diet or from supplementation to support muscle growth, maintenance, and repair [155]. The nine EAAs are histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. Most complete proteins (those that contain all EAAs) are composed of about 40% EAAs, so a meal or snack with 25 g total protein provides about 10 g EAAs. See other sections of this fact sheet for information on the amino acids arginine and glutamine as well as the BCAAs (leucine, isoleucine, and valine). The potential of these amino acids to enhance exercise and athletic performance is not related to their incorporation into proteins. Efficacy Adequate protein in the diet is required to provide the EAAs necessary for muscle-protein synthesis and to minimize muscle-protein breakdown. Dietary protein consumption increases the concentration of amino acids in the blood, which muscle cells then take up. Sufficient protein is necessary primarily to optimize the training response to, and the recovery period after, exercise [12,157]. Muscle protein synthesis leading to increases in strength and muscle mass appears to be optimal with the consumption of high-quality protein (providing about 10 g EAAs) within 0\u20132 hours after exercise, in the early recovery phase [12]. However, a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials found that ingesting protein within an hour before or after exercise does not significantly increase muscle strength or size or facilitate muscle repair or remodeling [77]. The period after exercise when protein intake reduces muscle protein breakdown, builds muscle, and increases mitochondrial proteins to enhance oxygen use by working muscles (the so-called window of anabolic opportunity) can last for up to 24 hours [79]. Several studies in people engaged in resistance training show that consuming some protein before sleep can increase the rate of protein synthesis during the night and/or augment muscle mass and strength [79,158,159]. Participants in these studies consumed a bedtime drink containing 27.5 or 40 g of the milk protein casein, which increased circulating amino acid levels throughout the night. Some studies show increased muscle protein synthesis when plasma levels of amino acids are raised [76]. Safety The Food and Nutrition Board has not set a UL for protein, noting that the risk of adverse effects from excess protein from food is very low [160]. However, it advises caution for those obtaining high protein intakes from foods and supplements because of the limited data on their potential adverse effects. High-protein diets (e.g., those providing two to three times the RDA of 0.8 g/kg/day for healthy adults and 0.85 g/kg/day for adolescents) do not appear to increase the risk of renal stones or dehydration; compromise renal function; reduce bone health; or, when consumed for several months, alter glomerular filtration rate or blood levels of lipids, glucose, creatine, or blood urea nitrogen [160-164]. Protein increases urinary calcium excretion, but this appears to have no consequence for long-term bone health [165] and, in any event, is easily compensated for by the consumption of slightly more calcium. Implications for use Many foods\u2014including meats, poultry, seafood, eggs, dairy products, beans, and nuts\u2014contain protein. Protein powders and drinks are also available, most of which contain whey, one of the complete proteins isolated from milk [166]. Digestion of casein, the main complete protein in milk, is slower than that of whey, so the release of amino acids from casein into the blood is slower [72]. Soy protein lacks the EAA methionine and might lose some cysteine and lysine in processing; rice protein lacks the EAA isoleucine [166]. Many protein supplements consist of a combination of these protein sources. All EAAs are necessary to stimulate muscle protein synthesis, so users should select singular or complementary protein sources accordingly. To maximize muscle adaptations to training, the AND, DoC, and ACSM recommend that athletes consume 0.3 g/kg body weight of high-quality protein (e.g., about 20 g for a person weighing 150 lb) 0 to 2 hours after exercise and then every 3 to 5 hours [12]. Since the Food and Nutrition Board developed the RDA for protein, more recent data have suggested that athletes require a daily protein intake of 1.2 to 2.0 g/kg to support metabolic adaptations, muscle repair and remodeling, and protein turnover [12,167]. Athletes might benefit from even greater amounts for short periods of intense training or when they reduce their energy intake to improve physique or achieve a competition weight [12]. The 2007\u20132008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) showed that the average daily intake of protein by adult men is 100 g and by women is 69 g [168]. Athletes who require additional protein can obtain it by consuming more protein-containing foods and, if needed, protein supplements and protein-fortified food and beverage products. Quercetin Quercetin is a polyphenolic flavonol that is naturally present in a variety of fruits (such as apples), vegetables (such as onions), and beverages (such as wine and, especially, tea). An analysis of NHANES 1999\u20132002 data found that estimated daily total flavonol (including quercetin) consumption by adults averaged about 13 mg/day [169]. The mechanisms by which quercetin might enhance exercise and athletic performance when taken in much larger amounts are not known, but many have been hypothesized. For example, quercetin might increase the number of mitochondria in muscle, reduce oxidative stress, decrease inflammation, and improve endothelial function (blood flow) [170,171]. Efficacy Numerous small studies have assessed quercetin in supplemental form as a potential ergogenic aid in young adult, mostly male, participants. These studies typically examined the endurance performance and VO2max of participants engaged in aerobic activities, such as running or cycling trials, who received either quercetin (most often 1,000 mg/day) or placebo for 1 to 8 weeks [170,172-175]. The effects of quercetin supplementation were inconsistent and varied by study, but they generally ranged from no ergogenic benefit to only a trivial or small improvement that might not be meaningful in real-world (in contrast to laboratory) exercise conditions [42,170,171,176]. Safety The studies of trained athletes and untrained participants cited in the previous paragraph who took as much as 1,000 mg/day quercetin for up to 2 months found no side effects or safety concerns. The safety of longer term use of that amount of quercetin or more has not been studied. FDA considers up to 500 mg/serving quercetin to be generally recognized as safe (GRAS) as an ingredient in foods such as beverages, processed fruits and fruit juices, grain products, pastas, and soft candies [171,177]. Implications for use More research, including larger clinical trials, on quercetin supplementation to improve aerobic capacity in trained athletes during specific sports and competitions is needed before any recommendations can be made [170]. Ribose Ribose, a naturally occurring 5-carbon sugar synthesized by cells and found in some foods, is involved in the production of ATP [75]. The amount of ATP in muscle is limited, and it must continually be resynthesized. Therefore, theoretically, the more ribose in the body, the more potential ATP production [178]. Efficacy The limited amount of research on ribose shows little if any benefit of doses ranging from 625 to 10,000 mg/day for up to 8 weeks for exercise capacity in both trained and untrained healthy adults [1,179]. Safety The authors of the short-term studies investigating ribose as a potential ergogenic aid have not reported any safety concerns. No studies have assessed the safety of long-term ribose use as a dietary supplement. Implications for use Supplemental ribose does not appear to improve aerobic or anaerobic performance [1,75]. Sodium bicarbonate Sodium bicarbonate is commonly known as baking soda. The consumption of several teaspoons of sodium bicarbonate over a short time temporarily increases blood pH by acting as a buffering agent. The precise mechanism by which this induced alkalosis leads to an ergogenic response to exercise is unclear. It is thought that bicarbonate loading enhances disposal of hydrogen ions that accumulate and efflux from working muscles as they generate energy in the form of ATP via anaerobic glycolysis from high-intensity exercise, thereby reducing the metabolic acidosis that contributes to fatigue [180,181]. As a result, supplementation with sodium bicarbonate might improve performance in short-term, intense exercises (e.g., sprinting and swimming) and in intermittently intense sports (e.g., boxing and tennis). Efficacy Many studies have assessed sodium bicarbonate as an ergogenic aid in swimmers, cyclists, rowers, boxers, tennis and rugby players, judo practitioners, and others [180-182]. These studies usually included a small number of participants who underwent one or more trials in a laboratory over several days. Because the research results are conflicting, the activities and individuals most likely to benefit from sodium bicarbonate supplementation in real-world conditions is not clear. Reviewers of these studies generally agree that taking about 300 mg/kg body weight sodium bicarbonate might provide a minor to moderate performance benefit in strenuous exercise over several minutes and in sports that involve intermittent, high-intensity activity [180-182]. However, individuals have varied responses to bicarbonate loading; the practice does not benefit some users, and it can worsen rather than enhance performance in others. Recreationally active individuals, in particular, might find the supplements to be ergogenic for one exercise session but not another. Many study findings suggest that supplementation with sodium bicarbonate is most likely to improve the performance of trained athletes [181,182]. Safety The main side effect of sodium bicarbonate supplementation in gram quantities is gastrointestinal distress, including nausea, stomach pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. Supplement users can reduce or minimize this distress by consuming the total dose in smaller amounts multiple times over an hour with fluid and a snack of carbohydrate-rich food [180,183]. Sodium bicarbonate is 27.4% sodium by weight; 1 teaspoon (4.6 g) contains 1,259 mg sodium. A 70-kg individual ingesting a recommended dose of 300 mg/kg body weight would consume approximately 5,750 mg sodium. Such a large intake of sodium with fluid can lead to temporary hyperhydration, which could be useful in activities where large sweat losses might otherwise lead to significant fluid deficits. However, the slight increase in body weight from fluid retention might hinder performance in other sports [180]. Studies have not evaluated the safety (and effectiveness) of long-term use of sodium bicarbonate as an ergogenic aid over months or longer. Implications for use The amount of sodium bicarbonate in recommended servings of dietary supplements\u2014about 300 mg/kg body weight, or the equivalent of 4\u20135 teaspoons of baking soda for most individuals taken 1\u20132 hours before exercise in one or multiple doses as a pill or as a powder mixed with a flavored fluid\u2014is generally much less than the quantity that could enhance exercise and athletic performance. Many athletes find this amount of sodium bicarbonate powder dissolved in fluid to be unpalatably salty [180]. The Australian Institute of Sport supports the use of bicarbonate for improving sports performance in suitable athletic competitions under the direction of an expert in sports medicine, but it notes that more research might be required to understand how the supplement should be used for best results [29]. Tart or sour cherry The Montmorency variety of tart or sour cherry (Prunus cerasus) contains anthocyanins and other polyphenolic phytochemicals, such as quercetin. Researchers hypothesize that these compounds have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that might facilitate exercise recovery by reducing pain and inflammation, strength loss and muscle damage from intense activity, and hyperventilation trauma from endurance activities [184-187]. The labels on tart-cherry juice and concentrate products do not usually indicate that they are dietary supplements, although the labels on products containing encapsulated tart-cherry powder do. Efficacy Much of the limited research on use of tart cherry to enhance exercise and athletic performance involves short-term use of a tart-cherry product or placebo by young resistance-trained men for about a week before a test of strength (such as single-leg extensions or back squats); participants continue taking the supplements for about 2 days after the test. Study results vary, but the benefits appear to include more rapid recovery of strength and/or lower perceived muscle soreness [184,185,188]. One pilot study investigated the use of tart-cherry juice (472 ml/day; the equivalent of 100\u2013120 whole cherries) or a placebo for a week before a marathon and 2 days afterward in 13 male and 7 female runners (age range 24\u201350 years) [186]. None of the participants who drank the juice experienced airway inflammation causing upper respiratory tract symptoms after the marathon (a common complaint in many marathon runners), but half of those drinking the placebo did. Another study compared a supplement containing 480 mg freeze-dried Montmorency tart-cherry-skin powder (CherryPURE) with a placebo in 18 male and 9 female endurance-trained runners and triathletes (age range 18\u201326 years) [189]. Participants took the supplements once a day for 10 days, including the day they ran a half-marathon, then for 2 days after the run. Participants taking the tart-cherry supplement averaged a statistically significant 13% shorter race finish time and had lower levels of blood markers of inflammation and muscle catabolism than the placebo takers, but perceptions of soreness of the quadriceps muscles did not differ significantly between the groups. Further research is needed to determine the value of tart-cherry products for enhancing performance and recovery from intense exercise or participation in sports\u2014especially when used on a regular basis\u2014and the amounts of supplement, juice, or concentrate needed to provide any benefits. Safety Studies have not identified any side effects of the fresh tart-cherry juice or concentrate or of supplements of dried tart-cherry-skin powder. However, they have not adequately assessed the safety of tart-cherry dietary supplements. Implications for use There is no expert consensus on the value of taking tart-cherry products to enhance exercise and athletic performance. Tribulus terrestris Tribulus terrestris (common names include bindii, goat's-head, bullhead, and tackweed), is a fruit-bearing plant that is most common in Africa, Asia, Australia, and Europe. It has been used since ancient times in Greece, China, and Asia to treat low libido and infertility [190]. Tribulus terrestris extracts contain many compounds, including steroidal saponins [191]. Some marketers claim that Tribulus terrestris enhances exercise and athletic performance by increasing serum concentrations of testosterone and luteinizing hormone, but studies have not adequately determined its potential mechanisms of action [192]. Efficacy Only a few small, short-term clinical trials have investigated Tribulus terrestris as an ergogenic aid [192], and none since 2007. In one study, 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg Tribulus terrestris or a placebo taken for 4 weeks by men age 20\u201336 years did not raise levels of either hormone [193]. A study in 15 resistance-trained men found no differences among those taking 3.21 mg/kg Tribulus terrestris or placebo for 8 weeks in improvements in bench and leg press scores or in muscle mass [194]. In 22 elite male rugby players age 19.8 years, on average, who were randomly assigned to take 450 mg/day Tribulus terrestris or a placebo for 5 weeks, the supplement did not have a superior effect on strength or lean body mass [192]. Safety The only toxicity studies of Tribulus terrestris were conducted in animals, where unspecified high intakes led to severe heart, liver, and kidney damage [190]. The clinical studies described above found no side effects of Tribulus terrestris. One case report involved an Iranian man with severe obesity, age 28, who consumed 2 L/day Tribulus terrestris water for 2 days before being hospitalized with seizures, severe weakness in the legs, malaise, and poor appetite [195]. Subsequent tests indicated hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and neurotoxicity. The man's condition improved after he discontinued the water, but the water was not tested to determine the presence or amount of Tribulus terrestris or any other potential toxin or contaminant. Implications for use The Australian Institute of Sport advises against the use of Tribulus terrestris by athletes, noting that this supplement and other claimed testosterone boosters are banned from athletic competitions or have a high risk of being contaminated with substances that, if ingested, could lead to positive drug-screening results [196]. The published biomedical literature provides no support for the efficacy and insufficient support for the safety of Tribulus terrestris for enhancing exercise performance [190]. Ingredients Banned from Dietary Supplements This section provides examples of ingredients that FDA currently prohibits in dietary supplements and that some consumers have used in the past as ergogenic aids, despite the lack of evidence supporting their use. Androstenedione Androstenedione is an anabolic steroid precursor, or prohormone, that the body converts to testosterone (which induces muscle growth) and estrogen [197]. Major League Baseball slugger Mark McGwire popularized androstenedione as an ergogenic aid in 1998 [198]. However, two randomized clinical trials found no performance benefits from androstenedione supplements. In one study, 10 healthy young men (age 19\u201329 years) took a single 100-mg dose of androstenedione. Another 20 were randomized to receive either 300 mg/day androstenedione or a placebo for 6 of 8 weeks while undergoing resistance-training and muscle-strengthening exercises [199]. The short-term or longer term use of the supplement did not affect serum testosterone concentrations, nor did it produce any significantly greater gains in resistance-training performance, muscle strength, or lean body mass. However, participants who took androstenedione for the 6 weeks experienced significant declines in their high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and significant increases in serum estrogens. A similar study randomized 50 men (age 35\u201365 years) to take 200 mg/day androstenedione, 200 mg/day of the related androstenediol, or a placebo for 12 weeks while participating in a high-intensity resistance training program [200]. The supplements did not improve participants' muscular strength or lean body mass compared with placebo, but they significantly decreased HDL cholesterol levels and raised levels of serum estrogens. Among participants taking the androstenedione, testosterone levels increased significantly by 16% after 1 month of use but declined to pretreatment levels by 12 weeks, in part due to downregulation of endogenous testosterone synthesis. In March 2004, FDA warned companies to cease distributing androstenedione-containing dietary supplements. The rationale was the lack of sufficient information to establish that such products could reasonably be expected to be safe and that FDA had never approved androstenedione as a new dietary ingredient permitted in supplements [197]. The U.S. Department of Justice classified androstenedione as a Schedule III controlled substance (defined as a drug with a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence) in 2004 [201]. The National Collegiate Athletic Association, International Olympic Committee, and World Anti-Doping Agency ban the use of androstenedione [128,197]. Dimethylamylamine Dimethylamylamine (DMAA) is a stimulant formerly included in some preworkout and other dietary supplements claimed to enhance exercise performance and build muscle. Studies have not evaluated DMAA in humans as a potential ergogenic aid. In 2013, FDA declared products containing this ingredient to be illegal after it received 86 reports of deaths and illnesses associated with dietary supplements containing DMAA. These reports described heart problems as well as nervous system and psychiatric disorders [202]. Furthermore, FDA had never approved DMAA as a new dietary ingredient that would reasonably be expected to be safe [202]. Although products marketed as dietary supplements containing DMAA are illegal in the United States, discontinued, reformulated, or even new products containing DMAA might still be found in the U.S. marketplace. The Department of Defense's Human Performance Resource Center maintains a list of currently available products that contain DMAA or are labeled as containing DMAA, 1-3-dimethylamylamine, or an equivalent chemical or marketing name (e.g., methylhexaneamine or geranium extract) [203]. FDA also determined that dietary supplements containing 1,3-dimethybutylamine (DMBA), a stimulant chemically related to DMAA, are adulterated. As with DMAA, FDA had never approved this stimulant as a new dietary ingredient. The agency contended that there is no history of use or data offering sufficient assurance that this compound is not associated with a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury [204,205]. Ephedra Ephedra (also known as ma huang), a plant native to China, contains ephedrine alkaloids, which are stimulant compounds; the primary alkaloid is ephedrine [206]. In the 1990s, ephedra\u2014frequently combined with caffeine\u2014was a popular ingredient in dietary supplements sold to enhance exercise and athletic performance and to promote weight loss. No studies have evaluated the use of ephedra dietary supplements, with or without caffeine, as ergogenic aids. Instead, available studies have used the related synthetic compound ephedrine together with caffeine and typically measured the effects 1\u20132 hours after a single dose [207,208]. These studies showed that the ephedrine\u2013caffeine combination produced a 20%\u201330% increase in power and endurance, but ephedrine alone had no significant effects on exercise-performance parameters, such as oxygen consumption or time to exhaustion [208]. No data show any sustained improvement in athletic performance over time with continued dosing of ephedrine with caffeine [207]. Ephedra use has been associated with death and serious adverse effects, including nausea, vomiting, psychiatric symptoms (such as anxiety and mood change), hypertension, palpitations, stroke, seizures, and heart attack [206,207]. In 2004, FDA banned the sale of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids in the United States because they are associated with an unreasonable risk of illness or injury [207]. The World Anti-Doping Agency prohibits the use of ephedrine in amounts that lead to urine concentrations of ephedrine (or the related methylephedrine) exceeding 10 mcg/ml [107]. Regulation of Dietary Supplements to Enhance Exercise and Athletic Performance FDA regulates dietary supplements for exercise and athletic performance in accordance with the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 [209]. Like other dietary supplements, exercise- and athletic-performance supplements differ from over-the-counter or prescription medications in that they do not require premarket review or approval by FDA. Supplement manufacturers are responsible for determining that their products are safe and their label claims are truthful and not misleading, although they are not required to provide this evidence to FDA before marketing their products. If FDA finds a supplement to be unsafe, it may remove the product from the market or ask the manufacturer to voluntarily recall the product. FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) may also take regulatory actions against manufacturers that make unsubstantiated physical-performance or other claims about their products. FDA permits dietary supplements to contain only dietary ingredients, such as vitamins, minerals, amino acids, herbs, and other botanicals. It does not permit these products to contain pharmaceutical ingredients, and manufacturers may not promote them to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease [209]. For more information about dietary supplement regulation, see the ODS publication, Dietary Supplements: What You Need to Know. Safety Considerations Like all dietary supplements, supplements used to enhance exercise and athletic performance can have side effects and might interact with prescription and over-the-counter medications. In some cases, the active constituents of botanical or other ingredients promoted as ergogenic aids are unknown or uncharacterized. Furthermore, many such products contain multiple ingredients that have not been adequately tested in combination with one another. People interested in taking dietary supplements to enhance their exercise and athletic performance should talk with their health care providers about the use of these products. The Uniformed Services University and the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency maintain a list of products marketed as dietary supplements that contain stimulants, steroids, hormone-like ingredients, controlled substances, or unapproved drugs and that can have health risks for warfighters and others who take them for bodybuilding or other forms of physical performance [210]. Fraudulent and adulterated products FDA requires the manufacture of dietary supplements to comply with quality standards that ensure that these products contain only the labeled ingredients and amounts and are free of undeclared substances and unsafe levels of contaminants [211]. However, FDA notes that products marketed as dietary supplements for bodybuilding are among those most often adulterated with undeclared or deceptively labeled ingredients, such as synthetic anabolic steroids or prescription medications [212]. As one example, some products sold for bodybuilding are adulterated with selective androgen receptor modulators; these synthetic drugs are designed to mimic the effects of testosterone [213]. Using such tainted products can cause health problems and lead to disqualification of athletes from competition if a drug test shows that they have consumed prohibited substances, even if they have done so unknowingly. FDA has warned against the use of any body-building products that claim to contain steroids or steroid-like substances [214]. It recommends that a user contact their health care provider if they experience symptoms possibly related to these products, especially nausea, weakness, fatigue, fever, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, jaundice (yellowing of skin or whites of eyes), or brown or discolored urine. Some dietary-supplement firms have hired third-party certification companies to verify the identity and content of their supplements to enhance exercise and athletic performance, thus providing some extra, independent assurance that the products contain the labeled amounts of ingredients and are free of many banned substances and drugs. The major companies providing this certification service are NSF (nsf.org) through its Certified for Sport program, Informed-Choice (informed-choice.org), and the Banned Substances Control Group (bscg.org). The products that meet the requirements of these companies may carry the certifier\u2019s official logo and are listed on the certifier\u2019s website. Interactions with medications Some ingredients in dietary supplements used to enhance exercise and athletic performance can interact with certain medications. For example, intakes of large doses of antioxidant supplements, such as vitamins C and E, during cancer chemotherapy or radiotherapy could reduce the effectiveness of these therapies by inhibiting cellular oxidative damage in cancerous cells [215]. Ginseng can reduce the anticoagulant effects of the blood thinner warfarin (Coumadin or Jantoven) [216]. Iron supplements can reduce the bioavailability of levodopa (used to treat Parkinson's disease) and levothyroxine (Levothyroid, Levoxyl, Synthroid, and others, for hypothyroidism and goiter), so users should take iron supplements at a different time of the day than these two drugs [217,218]. Cimetidine (Tagamet HB, used to treat duodenal ulcers) can slow the rate of caffeine clearance from the body and thereby increase the risk of adverse effects from caffeine consumption [219]. Individuals taking dietary supplements and medications on a regular basis should discuss the use of these products with their health care providers. Choosing a Sensible Approach to Enhance Exercise and Athletic Performance According to the AND, DoC, and ACSM, sound science supports the use of only a few dietary supplements whose labels claim ergogenic benefits [12]. These organizations add that the best way to use supplements is as additions to a carefully chosen diet, that dietary supplements rarely have ergogenic benefits when not used in these conditions, and that there is no justification for their use by young athletes. The National Federation of State High School Associations also expresses strong opposition to the use of supplements to enhance athletic performance by high school students [15]. The American Academy of Pediatrics adds that performance-enhancing substances do not result in significant improvements in most teenage athletes beyond those that can result from proper nutrition and training basics [7]. Elite and recreational athletes perform at their best and recover most quickly when they consume a nutritionally adequate diet with sufficient fluids and when they have appropriate physical conditioning and proper training. For more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans [10] and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's MyPlate [11]. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that: Includes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium Limits alcoholic beverages Stays within your daily calorie needs References Kreider RB, Wilborn CD, Taylor L, Campbell B, Almada AL, Collins R, Cooke M, Earnest CP, Greenwood M, Kalman DS, Kerksick CM, Kleiner SM, Leutholtz B, Lopez H, Lowery LM, Mendel R, Smith A, Spano M, Wildman R, Willoughby DS, Ziegenfuss TN, Antonio J.

Many of these studies examine \u201celite athletes\u201d (e.g., Olympians, professionals, and/or players recruited to national and varsity teams) and some focus on athletes in general. Despite all the efforts expended, by any definition, numerous athletes still experience inadequate sleep (Lucidi, Lombardo, Russo, Devoto & Violani, 2007; Samuels., 2008; Swinbourne, Gill, Vaile & Smart., 2016). Compared to non-athletes, athletes tend to sleep less on average (Leeder, Glaister, Pizzoferro, Dawson & Pedlar, 2012). Furthermore, athletes\u2019 quality of sleep appears to be lower than their non-athlete peers (Bleyer, Barbosa, Andrade, Teixeira & Felden., 2015; Tsunoda & al., 2015). Additionally, it has been suggested that certain types of athletes are more prone to developing sleep difficulties such as sleep apnea. For example, according to George, Kab & Levy (2003) and Albuquerque & al., (2010), National Football League (NFL) players have higher rates of obstructive sleep apnea, which has tremendous deleterious impacts on health and daytime sleepiness. Notably, there is increasing evidence that poor sleep is a good predictor for injuries and more importantly, concussion (Raikes, Athey, Alfonso-Miller, Killgore & Grandner, 2019).\n\n### Position Statements\n\nRecently, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), has addressed, for the first time, sleep as a major contributor to athletic performance and as a fundamental feature of athlete mental health (Reardon & al., 2019). In addition, the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) included sleep health as part of their published mental health best practices (Kroshus & al., 2019), as well as their more recently published official position statement on the importance of sleep health for student athletes (Kroshus & al., 2019). These position statements from the NCAA and IOC represent the increased awareness of the importance of sleep health among organizations of elite athletes. Both of these documents were the result of a literature review, delphi process of iterative consensus-building, and subsequent revision, following exhaustive reviews of available literature.\n\nThe IOC mental health document (Reardon, et al., 2019) considers sleep health in terms of sufficiency (i.e., at least 7 hours for adults), proper circadian alignment, good overall perceived sleep quality, and absence of sleep disorders including insomnia disorder and sleep apnea. The document recommends that these dimensions of sleep be considered important for mental health, as well as physical health and functioning. Further, the document recommends education, proper assessment and screening, and treatment using evidence-based strategies \u2013 given the consideration that some treatments may impact safety and/or performance.\n\nThe NCAA document focused on sleep as an important aspect of health, performance, and mental functioning in collegiate student athletes (Kroshus et a., 2019). It addresses many identified barriers to sleep, including academic, athletic, and social time demands. Similarly, this document defines sleep health in terms of duration (at least 7 hours in adults), timing, overall quality, and absence of disorders including insomnia and sleep apnea. Particular attention is also paid to the role of tiredness, fatigue, and/or sleepiness as consequences of sleep loss and/or disturbances. The NCAA makes 5 recommendations in this document:\n\n1. Conduct a collegiate athlete time demands survey annually.\n2. Recommendation 2: Ensure that consumer sleep technology, if used, is compliant with Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) laws.\n3. Recommendation 3: Incorporate sleep screening into the preparticipation exam.\n4. Recommendation 4: Provide collegiate athletes with evidence-based sleep education that includes: (1) information on sleep best practices; (2) information about the role of sleep in optimising athletic and academic performance and overall well-being; and (3) strategies for addressing sleep barriers.\n5. Recommendation 5: Provide coaches with evidence-based sleep education that includes: (1) information on sleep best practices; (2) information about the role of sleep in optimising athletic and academic performance and overall well-being; and (3) strategies to help optimise collegiate athlete sleep.\n\nThese efforts specifically recommend that sleep-related education should be provided, sleep difficulties and disorders should be routinely assessed and screened for, and sleep health promotion should be a goal of athletics programs.\n\n## EPIDEMIOLOGY OF SLEEP DISTURBANCES IN ATHLETES\n\n### Prevalence of Insufficient Sleep\n\nInsufficient sleep duration can impact metabolism, endocrine function, athletic and cognitive outcomes, and, furthermore, increase perceived effort during exercise (Chase & al., 2017; Spiegel, Leproult & Van Cauter, 1999; Spiegel & al., 2004). When athletes are compared to non-athletes, they tend to sleep less and less efficiently. Leeder, Glaister, Pizzoferro, Dawson & Pedlar, (2012) compared the habits of 47 elite athletes over a four-day period to a group of non-athletes, using actigraphy; age of participants were not reported, but groups were matched for age and gender. On average, athletes slept 6.55 \u00b1 0.43 vs 7.11 \u00b1 0.25 hours in the non-athletes (*p* = 0.27). However, they did report lower sleep efficiency (80.6 \u00b1 6.4 vs 88.7 \u00b1 3.6., *p* < 0.05), higher time spent in bed (8:07 \u00b1 0:20 vs 8:36 \u00b1 0:.53., *p* < 0.05), wake after sleep onset (0:50 \u00b1 0:16 vs 1:17 \u00b1 0:31., *p* < 0.05), sleep onset latency (5.0 \u00b1 2.5 vs 18.2 \u00b1 16.5., *p* < 0.05) and sleep fragmentation (29.8 \u00b1 9.0 vs 36.0 \u00b1 12.4., *p* < 0.05) in athletes. Furthermore, Lastella, Roach, Halson & Sargent (2015) reported insufficient sleep duration among athletes, with 6.8 hours on average. Sargent, Lastella, Halson & Roach (2014) also reported that over 14 nights assessed with actigraphy, athletes recorded an average of 6.5 hours of sleep per night.\n\nTaken together, these studies have investigated a total of 241 elite athletes and documented actigraphically-determined sleep durations of about 6 and a half hours in most cases. Recently, Mah and colleagues (2018) indicated that 39.1% of athletes reported insufficient sleep (< 7 hours) by self-report. And among a large sample of collegiate athletes in the US (N=8,312), Turner and colleagues reported that the mean number of nights per week that athletes did not think they got enough sleep was 3.8 (Turner et al 2019).\n\n### Prevalence of poor sleep quality\n\nHoshikawa, Uchida & Hirano (2018) investigated the quality of sleep of 817 Japanese elites\u2019 athletes with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), showing that 28% of the participants exhibit a score > 5, suggesting poor quality of sleep. Mah and colleagues (2018) reported that 42.2% of the 629 athletes in that study experienced poor sleep quality, also using the PSQI. In 2019, Turner and colleagues examined data from N=8,312 collegiate student athletes and found that 19.8% reported that \u201csleep difficulties\u201d were particularly \u201ctraumatic or difficult to handle\u201d over the past 12 months and that 21.8% reported extreme difficulty falling asleep at least 3 nights per week (Turner & al., 2019). Bleyer and colleagues reported that 38% of their 452 participants reported poor sleep (Bleyer, Barbosa, Andrade, Teixeira & Felden, 2015). Findings from a study conducted among elite rugby and cricket players (n = 175) showed that 50% of their participants\u2019 PSQI score were > 5, and that 9% scored > 10 (Swinbourne, Gill, Vaile & Smart, 2016). Tsunoda and colleagues (2015) reported the PSQI scores of 14 wheelchair basketball athletes (mean = 5.8 \u00b1 3.0) and compared their results with 103 non-athletes from the general population (mean = 4.51 \u00b1 2.14). Regardless of total sleep time, the wheelchair athletes reported lower sleep quality and lower sleep efficiency than matched non-athletes.\n\nIn a cohort of 317 Rio Olympic athletes from eleven different sports, poor sleep quality (as assessed by the PSQI) was prevalent in more than 50% of the athletes following the Olympic Games (Drew & al., 2018). This recapitulates the earlier results with a similar cohort, in which up to 83% of athletes reach the cutoff indicating poor sleep (Drew & al., 2017). Of note, the higher proportion with a score >5 occurred in the leadup to the Olympics and the lower figure was recorded at the Games. Consequently, regardless of the type of sports, these results highlight the prevalence of poor sleep quality among athletes.\n\n### Prevalence of Daytime Sleepiness\n\nFew studies have examined the prevalence of general fatigue and/or sleepiness among athletes. Turner and colleagues (2019) reported that 60.9% of collegiate athletes report that they experience feeling \u201ctired, dragged out, or sleepy during the day\u201d at least 3 days per week (as measured by self-report). Furthermore, 32.75% of these collegiate student athletes reported an inability to maintain wakefulness at least 3 times per week (by self-report). Mah and colleagues (2018) reported that 51% of student athletes in their study reported high scores (>=10) on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. These findings indicate high levels of sleepiness in elite athletes.\n\n### Prevalence of circadian preferences and disruption\n\nData exploring chronotype among the general population suggest that about 25% are morning type, 50% are intermediate types and about 25% are evening types (Fischer, Lombardi, Marucci-Wellman & Roenneberg, 2017). Very few studies have explored the chronotype distribution among athletes. Two studies (Samuels, 2008; Silva & al., 2012) indicated that 51% of athletes were classified as morning types, 40% as intermediate types and only 9% were classified as evening types. One study examined athletes in wheelchairs and the other examined school-age athletes and may not be representative of the elite athlete population. Lastella, Roach, Halson & Sargent (2016) investigated 114 elite athletes emerging from 5 different sports. Their results indicated that 28% were morning types, 65% were intermediate types and only 6% were evening types, supporting previous findings that athletes tend to pursue and excel in sports that match their chronotype (Lastella, Roach, Hurem & Sargent, 2010).\n\nCircadian rhythms can influence variations in performance, depending on the time of day and typical training schedules, which ultimately can affect competitive performance (Drust, Waterhouse, Atkinson, Edwards & Reilly, 2005). When athletes experience disturbances in their environments or routines such as overnight travel, repetitive time zone changes, evening training or late-night competition, endogenous circadian rhythms and normal sleep patterns may be out of synchrony (Beersma & Gordijn, 2007; Reilly & Edwards, 2007). Such disruptions in circadian and sleep patterns can increase homeostatic pressure and thus influence the regulation of emotions, body temperature, circulation of melatonin, and cause a significant increase in sleep latency (Lack & Wright, 2007). The sleep/wake behavior of athletes is often governed by their training schedule (Lastella, Roach, Halson, Martin, West & Sargent, 2015). Therefore, the role of chronotype among athletes may interact with the training schedule and should be considered to optimize training and performance (Drust, Waterhouse, Atkinson, Edwards & Reilly, 2005) and reduce the prevalence of chronobiologic disturbances.\n\n### Prevalence of sleep disorders\n\n#### Insomnia\n\nGupta, Morgan & Gilchrist (2017) demonstrated that the relation between elite sport participation and insomnia symptomology is poorly systematized. Daytime impairment \u2013 a key part of insomnia diagnosis \u2013 can reflect a wide variety of experiences including fatigue, emotional fluctuation, and psychomotor and/or neuropsychological performance, which all are important for elite athletes. Given this particular sensitivity to performance impairment and high levels of sleepiness (which is not common in insomnia), there arise some challenges in insomnia assessment among elite athletes. Traditional insomnia models might poorly discriminate insomnia *per se* in this non-traditional population (Samuels, James, Lawson & Meeuwisse, 2016). The multifaceted demands of elite sport including a high level of training volume (Collette, Kellmann, Ferrauti, Meyer & Pfeiffer, 2018; Sargent, Halson & Roach, 2014), pre-competition anxiety (Erlacher, Ehrlenspiel, Adegbesan & Galal El-Din, 2011; Lastella & al., 2015) circadian challenges (jet lag) (Samuels, 2012) can all predispose and precipitate sleep disturbance, thus leading to or facilitating symptomology of insomnia.\n\nGiven the absence of a validated sleep questionnaire specifically for athletes before the creation of the Athlete Sleep Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ) (Bender, Lawson, Werthner & Samuels, 2018), it is difficult to precisely indicate the insomnia prevalence in elite athletes. However, the systematic review conducted by Gupta Morgan & Gilchrist (2017) reported that sleep disturbance complaints range from 13 to 70% of the athletes and that overall, on average, 26% of the athletes significantly scored for insomnia symptoms using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire Index (PSQI). It should be noted that notwithstanding the popularity of these two questionnaires, none of them are specifically validated in an elite athlete population. Elite athletes are primarily selected on the basis of physiological predisposition but also psychological attributes (Allen, Greenlees & Jones, 2013). It is possible that personality traits that include a focus on success (e.g., perfectionism) may also predispose an elite athlete to insomnia (Harvey, Gehrman & Espie, 2014). Furthermore, the demands of elite sports, including an elevated frequency, intensity, and volume of activity and scheduling challenges (Sargent, Lastella, Halson & Roach, 2014; Sargent, Halson & Roach, 2014), coupled with pre-competition anxiety (Erlacher, Ehrlenspiel, Adegbesan & Galal El-Din, 2011) and jetlag/travel (Fowler, Duffield, Howle, Waterson & Vaile, 2015; Fowler, Duffield, Lu, Hickmans & Scott, 2016), all these factors may lead an individual toward sleep difficulties. Given that these challenges are uncommon among the general population and the relationship between risk factors and sleep may be fundamentally different in this group (e.g., distribution of muscle mass), tools not specifically validated in athletic populations should be used somewhat cautiously.\n\n#### Sleep Apnea\n\nThe prevalence of sleep apnea may be high in certain type of sports, such as strength, power and high contact sports where athletes often present with a large body mass and neck circumference (Dunican & Eastwood, 2017; Emsellem & Murtagh, 2005; Swinbourne, Gill, Vaile & Smart, 2016). In the National Football League (NFL) and National Hockey League (NHL), two high-speed and contact sports, an elevated body mass index and a large neck circumference are considered protective assets, making athletes less injury-prone (Swinbourne, Gill, Vaile & Smart, 2016). However, these specific body traits, unfortunately, also predispose these athletes to an increased risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (Ahbab & al., 2013; Emsellem & Murtagh, 2005; Mihaere & al., 2009). Two studies carried out among NFL players illustrated that players with these specific physical traits appeared to have a higher incidence of OSA (George, Kab, Kab, Vila & Levy, 2003; Rice & al., 2010). Additionally, in line with the previous Football studies, Dobrosielski and colleagues (2016) illustrated that approximately 8% of the NCAA-I football players were at risk for OSA. Moreover, in professional hockey players, OSA was present in approximately 10% of athletes (Tuomilehto & al., 2017). It is reported that in most cases, the OSA severity was \u201cmild\u201d but even mild OSA might cause major disturbances in sleep (Jackson, Howard & Barnes, 2011), therefore potentially impacting athletic performance.\n\n#### Other Disorders\n\nVery few studies have been conducted on Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) among athletes. Findings from a study assessing a population of runners, indicate prevalence is suggested to be around 13% (Fagundes & al., 2010). Among hockey players, prevalence is suggested to be around 5% (Tuomilehto & al., 2017); Finally, within a sample of rugby players, no participants reported RLS but 12% reported periodic limb movements (PLMs) (Dunican & al., 2019). These three studies have shown that sleep disorders such as RLS and PLMs are relatively common among elite athletes from a variety of sports.\n\n## IMPACT OF SLEEP ON PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE\n\nAdverse effects of sleep restriction on athletic performance have been documented for many years, including cardiorespiratory and psychomotor effects, which require sustained and stable performance over time (Edwards & Waterhouse, 2009; Horne & Pettitt, 1984; Martin, 1981; Mougin & al., 1989; Mougin & al., 1991). Mougin (1991) observed 7 participants on a cycle ergometer, in a study that included a 10 minute warmup, then a 20 minute steady exercise corresponding to 75% of the predetermined maximal oxygen consumption, followed by an increased intensity exercise until exhaustion. This was done along with sleep restriction (3 hours of wakefulness in the middle of the night). In this study, physiological demands were significantly higher during the submaximal effort compared to a baseline night (10:30pm to 7:00am), (Mougin & al., 1991). Heart rate was significantly higher when measured after 9 minutes (167.1 \u00b1 2.0 vs 171.3 \u00b1 2.5) and after 20 minutes (176.0 \u00b1 2.6 vs 179.1 \u00b1 2.4). Also, ventilation (141.0 \u00b1 5.7 vs 157.5 \u00b1 6.4) and respiratory frequency (43.0 \u00b1 1.6 vs 44.7 \u00b1 1.7) were both altered following a sleep restriction when compared to baseline. Similarly, these same variables were significantly higher after the sleep restriction condition when performing a graded exercise stress test, until exhaustion, while the volume of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) decreased. Lactate accumulation was also greater at the 9^th^ minutes (P < 0.01), at the 20^th^ minutes (P < 0.05) of the steady power exercise and at maximal exercise (P < 0.05) following sleep restriction. These results from Mougin (1991) elegantly demonstrated that following a sleep restriction, physical performances would require a higher physiological demand, ultimately leading the athletes to exhaustion faster than he should have been. However, in a separate study there was no significant change in mean or maximal power in anaerobic tests after a 3:00am bedtime, compared to a 10:30pm bedtime (Mougin et al., 1996). Subsequent studies by Mougin showed that following 4-hours sleep restriction, the maximum work rate developed by the participants was reduced by 15 watts for cyclists in a 30-minute exercise at 75% of maximum power (Mougin et al., 2001). In agreement with some of the previous results, the average and maximum power of an anaerobic test decreases among students (Souissi et al., 2008), football players (Abedelmalek et al., 2013) and judokas (Souissi et al., 2013) following a single 4-hour sleep restriction. The reasoning behind the decrease in resistance to exercise is the alteration of the aerobic pathways (Mougin et al., 1989), or in the perceptual change (impression of a longer effort), since the physiological aspects remain predominantly unchanged (Horne & Pettitt 1984, Martin 1981). Indeed, the increase in perceived effort accompanied by a reduction in generated power supports the theory of neuromuscular fatigue (Abbiss & Laursen, 2005), possibly indicating a combination of central nervous system response and neural theory of sleep (Horne & Pettitt 1984, Stickgold, 2005, Walker & Stickgold 2005).\n\nOther studies have also shown adverse impacts of sleep restriction on athletes\u2019 anaerobic power (Taheri & Arabameri, 2012), tennis serving accuracy (Reyner & Horne, 2013), isometric force (Ben, Latiri, Dogui & Ben, 2017), and cortisol levels (Omisade, Buxton & Rusak, 2010). In addition, the average distance traveled by elite runners decreases (6.224 to 6.037 miles) in a treadmill exercise (30 minutes) at their own pace (Oliver, Costa, Laing, Bilzon & Walsh, 2009). Skein and colleagues (2011) reported lower average sprint times, reduced glycogen concentration in the muscles, decreased strength and activation during an isometric force test following a 30-hour total sleep deprivation with 10 athletes from team sports compared to a normal 8-hours of sleep. Submaximal-effort sports, such as running, might be more likely to be affected by total sleep deprivation than the maximum-effort sports, such as weightlifting, as they require more time, therefore negatively impacting the perception of effort throughout time and based on the higher physiological demand required (Mougin & al., 1991). After sleep restriction, the perception of effort increases exponentially increased completion time of the test (Oliver, Costa, Laing, Bilzon & Walsh, 2009). However, the differences in muscle contraction results (voluntary activation) can probably be explained by the sensitivity and accuracy of the electromyography equipment used. For example, previous studies have probably been limited in this aspect contrary to recent studies due to the technological advancement of equipment (Katirji, 2012; Skein, Duffield, Edge, Short & Muendel, 2011). In summary, although the effects of sleep deprivation on exercise are not completely understood, many converging results imply adverse effects of sleep deprivation on athletic performance.\n\nMoreover, the balance of the energy substrate seems vulnerable to sleep deprivation. For instance, a 30-hour sleep deprivation compared to an 8-hour sleep opportunity, demonstrated the inability of the human body to fully recover (24 hours) muscle glycogen in an athletic population as shown by the muscle glycogen concentration before exercise (310 \u00b1 67 mmol*kg^\u22121^ dw vs 209 \u00b1 60 mmol*kg^\u22121^ dw) (Skein, Duffield, Edge, Short & Muendel, 2011). Inadequate glucose intake would hinder athletes' ability to compete for extended periods, as glycogen shortage is known to reduce muscle function and athletic stamina (Costill & al., 1988; Le Meur, Duffield & Skein, 2012). Indeed, it seems that a large energy imbalance leads to a deterioration in both aerobic and anaerobic power production when activity is sustained over several days and sleep is reduced (Guezennec, Satabin, Legrand & Bigard, 1994; Hausswirth & al., 2014; Jung & al., 2011; Markwald & al., 2013; Waterhouse, Atkinson, Edwards & Reilly, 2007). Prolonged periods of sleep deprivation are associated with increased sympathetic nervous system activity and decreases in parasympathetic nervous system activity as well as altered spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity during vigilance testing in healthy adults (Zhong & al., 2005). Since disturbances of sympathetic and parasympathetic equilibrium are associated with overtraining (Achten & Jeukendrup, 2003), it is possible that these disturbances of the autonomic nervous system following sleep deprivation may promote the development of a state of overtraining in athletes (Hynynen, Uusitalo, Konttinen & Rusko, 2006; Le Meur, Duffield & Skein, 2012). Despite this, several studies have reported that sleep deprivation has minimal impact on the cardiorespiratory variables during exercise (Azboy & Kaygisiz, 2009; Horne & Pettitt, 1984; Mougin et al., 1996) as oppose to the previous finding of Mougin and colleagues (1991). Differences are probably more attributable to the protocols administered and the exercise mode used (running, cycling, time of exhaustion) throughout these different studies. In addition to these results, there were no significant effects on cardiorespiratory or thermoregulatory function in athletes despite a reduction in the distance run for 30 minutes on a treadmill following sleep deprivation (Oliver, Costa, Laing, Bilzon & Walsh, 2009). Oliver (2009) hypothesized the minimal effects on cardiorespiratory function could be due to the influence of perceived effort during the final stages of prolonged high intensity exercise (described above).\n\n## IMPACT OF SLEEP ON INJURY RISK AND RECOVERY\n\n### Sleep and concussions\n\nIt is estimated that as many as 3.8 million concussions are sustained in the U.S. during competitive sports (Harmon & al., 2013). Regrettably, approximately 50% of concussions may go unreported (Harmon & al., 2013). As many as 1 million student-athletes reported having two or more concussions during a period of twelve months (Depadilla, Miller, Jones, Peterson & Breiding, 2018). A study indicated that 40% of athletes with a concussion reported that their coaches were not aware of their symptoms (Rivara & al., 2014). Moreover, it is suggested that athletes involved in team sports have significantly higher risk for one or more concussion than athletes in individual sports (Depadilla, Miller, Jones, Peterson & Breiding, 2018).\n\nSleep may play an important role as a risk factor for concussions. Participants were given sleep screening questionnaires and followed over a one-year period. Predictors of incident concussions included clinically moderate to severe insomnia (RR = 3.13, 95% CI: 1.320\u20137.424, p = 0.015) and excessive daytime sleepiness (RR = 2.856, 95% CI: 0.681\u201311.977, p = 0.037), in a study of N=190 NCAA athletes (Raikes, Athey, Alfonso-Miller, Killgore & Grandner, 2019), and these risk factors outperformed more traditional risk factors (e.g., high-risk sport, history of concussions) as predictors.\n\nPost-concussion sleep is also important. Recently, a meta-analysis reported that sleep disturbances were reported following a concussion about 50% of the time (Mathias & Alvaro, 2012). The most common sleep disturbances reported following a concussion are daytime sleepiness and insomnia by 50% and 25%, respectively (Verma, Anand & Verma, 2007). In addition, sleep disturbance may be a prominent contributor to exacerbate comorbid features of depression, fatigue and pain following a concussion (Mathias & Alvaro, 2012) and worsen recovery because normal recuperative functions of sleep are altered (Weber, Webb & Killgore, 2013).\n\nA return to baseline cognition and self-reported symptoms are key priorities that could be adopted to ensure player safety (McCrory & al., 2013; McCrory & al., 2017). However, it has been demonstrated that athletes sleeping fewer than 7 hours the previous night of testing would perform worse (McClure, Zuckerman, Kutscher, Gregory & Solomon, 2014). Considering that the decision of allowing a player back to play results from a comparison of pre and post concussion performance, a valid neurocognitive baseline is needed. In that sense, sleep should be monitored throughout the year to obtain an adequate neurocognitive performance and therefore a valid baseline. Moreover, the difference in symptomatic presentation following a concussion is highly divergent between males and females athletes (Brown, Elsass, Miller, Reed & Reneker, 2015). This highlights the existing gap between the type of athletes and the consideration that should be directed toward an individualize baseline assessment to better detect the symptomology of a concussion.\n\nConcussion, regardless of severity, is an injury to the brain, and athletes who are suspected of such an injury should be carefully monitored (Graham & al., 2014; McCrory & al., 2013a). An increase in awareness has directly led to more interest into post-concussion symptoms (Eisenberg, Meehan & Mannix, 2014; Lau, Collins & Lovell, 2011). Research has specifically pointed out that the continuation of poor sleep symptoms following a concussion was a reliable predictor of prolonged recovery (Gosselin & al., 2009; Lau, Collins & Lovell, 2011a; Sufrinko, Howie, Elbin, Collins & Kontos, 2018). Additionally, Kostyun and colleagues (2015) demonstrated that during recovery, adolescents who reported greater sleep disturbance performed worse on neurocognitive testing.\n\n### Insufficient sleep as a risk factor for injury\n\nAthletes aim to achieve peak performance for as long as possible, given typically short careers with high stakes. An online study of adolescent students (12 to 18 years old) reported that students sleeping less than 8.1 hours a night were 1.7 times more likely to have had an injury than their peers who slept more than 8.1 hours (Jones, Griffiths, Towers, Claxton & Mellalieu, 2018; Milewski & al., 2014). Furthermore, the same study also indicated that for each additional grade in school, students were 1.4 times more likely to have had an injury. Taken together, insufficient sleep duration may increase the risk of injury. Additionally, the summation of years of (accumulated) sleep debt may play a role in risk injury outcomes.\n\nNutrition plays a fundamental role in recovery and injury prevention (Drew & al., 2017; Mountjoy & al., 2018; Pyne, Verhagen & Mountjoy, 2014; Smyth, Newman, Waddington, Weissensteiner & Drew, 2019), and nutrition and sleep have a bidirectional relationship (Chaput & Dutil, 2016; Grandner, Jackson, Gerstner & Knutson, 2013; Grandner, Jackson, Gerstner & Knutson, 2014; Halson, 2014; Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, Oliver, Bastos, Guill\u00e9n & Dom\u00ednguez, 2017). There is an association between the number of hours slept and the intake of dietary nutriments categories (Grandner, Jackson, Gerstner & Knutson, 2014). Furthermore, individuals that have a later bedtime, tend to consume a higher percentage of carbohydrates, fat and protein than the average sleepers (Baron, Reid, Van Horn & Zee, 2013). On the other hand, some nutriment categories may have a positive effect on sleep such as tart cherries and kiwis that are believed to reduce the number of awakening and increasing the sleep time (Lin, Tsai, Fang & Liu, 2011). Although nutritional knowledge is assumed to be high among athletes (Heaney, O\u2019Connor, Michael, Gifford & Naughton, 2011) data are sparse on the number of athletes who are following their diet on a regular basis, and this may be impacted by poor sleep, which influences food intake (Shechter, Grandner & St-Onge, 2014).\n\nAdolescents sleeping fewer than 8 hours per night were more likely to sustain an injury (Von Rosen, Frohm, Friden & Heijne, 2017) compared to students sleeping greater than 8-hours. These results are in line with Milewski and colleagues (2014). This is interesting given that the results are replicated in a population of athletes. Additionally, Von Rosen and colleagues (2017) found that the recommended intake of fruits, vegetables and fish was not met for 20%, 39% and 43% of their athletes, respectively. Therefore, the hypothesis of combined effect of poor sleep and a poor nutrition needs to be further explored in order to better understand the mechanisms underlying injuries in athletes. Moreover, lack of sleep and poor sleep quality exacerbate depression and anxiety symptoms (Owens, 2014), which may also increase injury risk. In a study of N=958 athletes, 40.6% experienced an injury of various nature (Li, Moreland, Peek-Asa & Yang, 2017). At preseason, 28.8% of the 958 enrolled athletes in this study reported anxiety symptoms and 21.7% reported depressive symptoms. Those with anxiety symptoms were 2.3 times more likely to have had an injury (Li, Moreland, Peek-Asa & Yang, 2017). Given the strong association between poor sleep, anxiety and depression symptoms (Baglioni & al., 2011; Lee, Buxton, Andel & Almeida, 2019), it can be speculated that insufficient sleep may indirectly lead to an injury.\n\n### Insufficient sleep and recovery\n\nPoor sleep quality and sleep deprivation impair brain functions that affect a wide array of cognitive functions (Killgore, 2010), which may directly or indirectly facilitate recovery from mental effort and/or physical injury. Furthermore, sleep deprived individuals might increase their intake of unhealthy foods which ultimately will impair glycogen repletion and protein synthesis (Morselli, Leproult, Balbo & Spiegel, 2010), which are critical for recovery in athletes. Additionally, impaired sleep directly affects growth hormone release and alters cortisol secretion (Mougin & al., 2001), therefore, impacting recovery from exercise and stress. Sleep deprivation also increases proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6 and C-reactive Protein (CRP) level which are pain-facilitating agents (McMahon, Cafferty & Marchand, 2005), ultimately affecting the immune system, and hinders muscle recovery and repair from damages sustained in high intensity training and leads towards an imbalance of the autonomic nervous system (Haack, Sanchez & Mullington, 2007; Haack, Lee, Cohen & Mullington, 2009). Moreover, athletes who feel the need to push the boundaries of their capabilities may tend to develop poor sleep patterns, therefore increasing their chances of illness (i.e., medical symptoms) and this impacted their performance and recovery (Hausswirth & al., 2014).\n\n## IMPACT OF SLEEP ON MENTAL AND COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE\n\n### Vigilance and reaction time\n\nSleep restriction has been demonstrated to negatively impact attention and reaction time (Basner & Dinges, 2011; Dinges & al., 1997; W\u0142odarczyk, Ja\u015bkowski & Nowik, 2002). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that reaction times are adversely impacted following only a one night, complete sleep deprivation (Taheri & Arabameri, 2012).\n\nSleep extension, conversely, has been shown to improve reaction times by 15% and also improve objective daytime sleepiness (Kamdar, Kaplan, Kezirian & Dement, 2004) in a study of student-athletes. Mah, Mah, Kezirian & Dement, (2011) extended the sleep of a college basketball team during a 5-7 week period. The average total sleep time increased from 7.50 to 10.25 hours of sleep over this period. Student athletes improved their reaction time scores (p <0.001) in morning and evening testing sessions. Given that athletes often experience at least mild sleep restriction (especially during intense periods of training or competition), sleep management becomes a priority to maximize reaction time. Consistent with the findings on sleep extension, there is evidence that we can \u201cbank\u201d sleep in order to optimize vigilance and reaction time (Arnal & al., 2015; Arnal & al., 2016; Rupp, Wesensten, Bliese & Balkin, 2009).\n\n### Executive function and decision making\n\nExecutive functions are one of the cornerstones to athletic performance (Marchetti & al., 2015; Micai, Kavussanu & Ring, 2015). These include the highest levels of thinking required to engineer a strategy, make a fast decision, demonstrate cognitive flexibility and manage the prioritization of attention. Deep sleep / slow-wave sleep seems to have different restorative functions both at the neurophysiologic and phenomenological level. Indeed, deep sleep appears to have a beneficial impact on the prefrontal cortex which will also have a positive impact on the functions directed by this cerebral region. (Goel, Rao, Durmer & Dinges, 2009; Wilckens, Erickson & Wheeler, 2012). Prioritization or inhibitory control ensures the control of the athlete\u2019s concentration, attention, and thoughts, and suppresses the cognitive and behavioural external and internal distractions (Diamond, 2013; Lehto, Juuj\u00e4rvi, Kooistra & Pulkkinen, 2003). Cognitive flexibility is vital for athletes by ensuring efficiency and adaptation in changing tasks (Diamond, 2013; Kiesel & al., 2010). Adaptation is key in athletics; it prevents athletes from making a bad or a risky decision and this inhibitory control is highly linked to sleep deprivation (Killgore, Balkin & Wesensten, 2006; Rossa, Smith, Allan & Sullivan, 2014).\n\nThese studies underscore the deleterious effects of lack of sleep on executive functions. Too little sleep may alter an athlete\u2019s ability to make a good decision versus a risky one in a split second, during the course of a game or event. Caffeine as been suggested as a countermeasure to protect against effects on risk-taking or poor decision-making (Killgore, Kamimori & Balkin, 2011). However, it has been demonstrated that caffeine does not replace a proper night of sleep for these functions (Clark & Landolt, 2017; Drake, Roehrs, Shambroom & Roth, 2013; Dunican & al., 2018; Reyner & Horne, 2013).\n\n### Learning and memory\n\nLearning new skills is crucial for every athlete. The roots of memory consolidations are found in sleep (Huber, Ghilardi, Massimini & Tononi, 2004; Maquet, 2001; Stickgold, Hobson, Fosse & Fosse, 2001; Stickgold, 2005). The ability to recall information (Gais, Lucas & Born, 2006) is inevitably of interest for athletes. For example, the NFL requires emphasis on the playbook and the ability to recall complex plays is essential for participation in football. Moreover, learning and improving a motor skill is known to continue 24 hours following training (Karni & al., 1998). In healthy young adults, nonrapid eye movement (NREM) stage 2 (N2), typically represent about 45%-55% of total sleep time (Carskadon & Dement, 2011). It has been demonstrated that the duration of sleep stage 2 (NREM) is strongly correlated with the consolidation of motor skills (Albouy, King, Maquet & Doyon, 2013a; Doyon, Gabitov, Vahdat, Lungu & Boutin, 2018; Walker, Brakefield, Morgan, Hobson & Stickgold, 2002). Arguably, the sleep period following learning a new skill is crucial and it has been shown that sleep restriction can adversely impact the memory consolidation (Curcio, Ferrara & De Gennaro, 2006).\n\nWhile it is true to a certain point that \u201cpractice makes perfect,\u201d the results of several studies indicated that sleep after learning improves performance significantly, relative to sleep deprivation (Albouy & al., 2013b; Ashworth, Hill, Karmiloff-Smith & Dimitriou, 2014; Walker & Stickgold, 2006). So perhaps \u201csleep makes perfect.\u201d It should also be noted that sleep restriction also negatively impacts the academic performance of student athletes (Huang & al., 2016). 56 students were either assigned to a 5-hours or 9-hours time in bed (TIB) for 14 consecutive days in which participants had to study for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). Results showed that the sleep-restricted group were significantly impacted for the recall of massed item, which is fundamental in academic success.\n\nAnother group of elite athletes, student-athletes, not only need to be prepared for their competition but also for academics. Turner and colleagues found that general sleep difficulty, initial insomnia, daytime tiredness, daytime sleepiness, and insufficient sleep were all associated with decreased academic performance among student-athletes (Turner & al., 2019). It is partially the coach\u2019s responsibility to mentor their student-athletes to be ready for any kind of test, either athletic or academic. Ultimately, assessing sleep on a regular basis, could provide crucial information for the coaching members and the athletes (Okano, Kaczmaryk, Dave, Gabrieli & Grossman, 2019). Furthermore, having a clear idea of how an athlete sleep may help the team medical specialist prevent injuries such as concussion (Raikes, Athey, Alfonso-Miller, Killgore & Grandner, 2019).\n\n### Creativity and thinking\n\nThrough sleep, the consolidation theory suggests that learning and memory consolidation would benefit creativity (Oudiette & al., 2011). The relationship between sleep and creativity stems from the direct influence of sleep on learning and formation of new concepts, ideas or solutions, and ultimately the genesis of creativity (Marguilho, Jesus, Viseu, Rus & Brandolim, 2014). It was demonstrated that REM sleep can improve creative problem solving (Cai, Mednick, Harrisson, Kanady & Mednick, 2009). REM sleep, according to Cai and colleagues (2009), enhanced creativity for items that are primed before sleep by over 40%. Another study showed that stage 1 sleep was associated with fluency and flexibility and slow wave sleep and REM sleep were associated with originality and global measure of figural creativity (Drago & al., 2011). Furthermore, in a Remote Associates Test (RAT) study, participants were faced with different levels of difficulty and the unsolved problems were re-presented after a period of sufficient sleep, wake or no delay (Sio, Monoghan & Ormerod, 2013). The sleep group solved a greater number of difficult RAT items than the other groups. These findings suggest that sleep facilitates creative thinking for harder problems. Creative problem solving is essential for elite athletes. Every game, every competition, elite athletes are faced with decisions that can either improve or lessen their chance of winning. Therefore, it would be essential to investigate how sleep can enhance problem solving within an environment filled with distractions, coupled with the rapidity of execution which is more typical for elite athletes.\n\n## IMPACT OF SLEEP ON MENTAL HEALTH\n\n### Sleep and anxiety/stress\n\nPrevious studies have pointed out the bidirectional associations between sleep, daily stressors and poor mood states (Lee, Crain, McHale, Almeida & Buxton, 2017; Sin & al., 2017). Moreover, poor sleep quality and short sleep duration were significantly associated with cognitive interferences related to stress the next day such as the experience eof intrusive, unwanted, off-task and potentially ruminated thoughts (Lee, Buxton, Andel & Almeida, 2019). Additionally, associations in the opposite direction were found such as stressful and cognitive interferences throughout the day would lead to an earlier bedtime and earlier wake time (Lee & al, 2019).\n\nPrevalence of anxiety symptoms in adult athletes range from 7.1 to 26% (Gouttebarge, Frings-Dresen & Sluiter, 2015; Gulliver, Griffiths, Mackinnon, Batterham & Stanimirovic, 2015). Student-athletes report higher rates of anxiety, up to 37% (Li, Moreland, Peek-Asa & Yang, 2017; Storch, Storch, Killiany & Roberti, 2005). In a study by Lastella, Lovell and Sargent (2014), 21% of the athletes reported that anxiety was the primary reason for their awakening during the night. Additionally, Savis, Eliot, Gansneder & Rotella, 1997, reported, among student-athletes, a lower sleep quality the night before a competition. Student-athletes reported that the primary reason to their sleep difficulty was anxiety and that this greatly affected their performance the following day (Brassington, 2002; Lee, Buxton, Andel & Almeida, 2019; Walters, 2002). Moreover, Davenne (2009) reported that continuously being in a new sleep environment exacerbated the anxiety, thus negatively impacting sleep and therefore performance.\n\nAthletes not getting sufficient sleep consistently show higher rates of anxiety, therefore leading to an increased difficulty coping with new environmental challenges and stressors, which is a key component to performance for every athlete (Brassington, 2002; Walters, 2002). Further studies are needed to clarify this bidirectional relation in athletes in order to develop appropriate plan of action and adaptative strategy to optimize performance.\n\n## INTERVENTIONS AT THE TEAM LEVEL\n\n### Promoting a culture of healthy sleep\n\nPrioritizing sleep in athletes\u2019 preparation and recovery routine is not an easy task. There is an omnipresent attitude in our society toward sleep that has been put forward where being able to tolerate insufficient sleep is a sign of mental strength and a \u201cbadge of honor\u201d (Adler, 2009; Grandner, 2017). These attitudes may influence young elite athletes who are trying to reach the highest level performance in their respective sports. To counter this, teams can promote a culture of healthy sleep as a performance enhancer. This includes embracing the idea that sleep is essential to athletic performance and recovery and counteract the perception that getting sufficient sleep should produce a feeling of guilt. Several high-profile athletes have now publicly discussed the importance of sleep in their preparation and recovery (Schultz, 2014). Unfortunately, these athletes\u2019 habits are not yet the norm and throughout the literature and sport culture; sleep is not yet a priority among elite athletes and professional team sports, though this may be changing.\n\n### Systematically screening for sleep problems\n\nSystematically screening for sleep problems is required in order to understand the scope of the problem, identify areas that need improvement, and identify individuals at risk for sleep problems (Kroshus & al., 2019). Ideally, teams need to screen athletes at the beginning of the season and follow up with prospective sleep assessment. Challenges include integrating sleep assessments into existing programs, decisions about what tools to use, implementing sleep assessment at multiple timepoints, and strategies for assessing sleep disorders. In addition, developing collaborative relationships with sleep providers should be a priority (Grandner & al., 2016). Healthy sleep for student-athletes: A guide for athletics departments and coaches. NCAA Sport Science Institute Newsletter, 4(2).)\n\nTo date, only one sleep questionnaire has been validated in athletes; the Athlete Sleep Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ) (Bender, Lawson, Werthner & Samuels, 2018). Another promising tool is the Athlete Sleep Behavioral Questionnaire (ASBQ) (Driller, Mah & Halson, 2018), that mainly addresses poor sleep behavior.\n\n### Treating sleep disorders\n\nIn order to treat sleep disorders among elite athletes, proper sleep screening is essential. Different types of athletes may be differentially susceptible to certain types of sleep disorders. For example, American football players may have a higher prevalence of sleep apnea due to their physical attributes (George & Kab, 2011; Rogers & al., 2017), and swimmers may experience circadian rhythm problems due to their early practice schedules (Sargent, Halson & Roach, 2014).\n\nSports medicine teams should be educated on diagnosing and treating sleep disorders and referring to sleep specialists when appropriate (Grandner, 2014), and education about sleep disorders should be provided to both athletes and staff (Kroshus & al., 2019). Furthermore, the sport medicine specialist should also be the provider and the promoter of good sleep behavior and its beneficial effects on athletic and academic performance.\n\nWhen sleep disorders are identified, appropriate evidence-based treatments should be applied, just as in non-athletes (Kroshus & al., 2019; Reardon & al., 2019), including positive airway pressure therapy and oral appliances for sleep apnea and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. It should be noted, though, that sometimes evidence-based treatments of sleep disorders in athletes can be problematic. For example, sedating medications may be clinically indicated but may impede athletics performance, and some empirically supported treatments may actually be banned substances in sport (Reardon & al., 2019). For this reason, clinical providers may need to be sensitive to these issues and may need to consider whether sedating treatments impair performance or whether stimulating treatments are restricted because they are performance-enhancing.\n\n### Managing training and travel schedules\n\nThe relationship between training loads, timing, intensity, sleep and performance is likely quite complex and not entirely understood. An increase in training load and training intensity, and decrease in hours of sleep, is associated with increased injury risk (Von Rosen, Frohm, Kottorp, Frid\u00e9n & Heijne, 2017a). Therefore, training more efficiently may be preferable to training longer or harder. This would be more preferable to the accumulation of training load without a profitable recovery, accompanied with a decrease in performance and the need for an extended period of recovery (Halson & Jeukendrup, 2004; Meeusen & al., 2013).\n\n## CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS\n\nSleep health is an important consideration for athletic performance. Athletes are at high risk of insufficient sleep duration (i.e., less than 7\u20138 hours per night), poor sleep quality (e.g., difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or other sleep difficulties), daytime sleepiness and fatigue, suboptimal sleep schedules (e.g., too early or late), irregular sleep schedules, and sleep & circadian disorders (especially insomnia and sleep apnea). These issues, individually and in combination likely impact athletic performance via a number of domains. Sleep loss and/or poor sleep quality can impair muscular strength, speed, and other aspects of physical performance. Sleep issues can also increase risk of concussions and other injuries, and impair recovery following injury. Cognitive performance is also impacted in a number of domains, including vigilance, learning and memory, decision-making, and creativity. Sleep also plays important roles in mental health, which is important for not only athletic performance, but the well-being of athletes in general. Figure 1 depicts a summary of these findings. These relationships have begun to be formally incorporated into athletics organizations, with official position statements that address sleep health published by the NCAA and the IOC (Kroshus et al., 2019; Reardon et al., 2019).\n\nMuch future research on sleep in athletes is needed. This is because athletes represent a very diverse group of individuals, and most studies in athletes are small, confined to a single team and/or sport, and include inconsistent measurement approaches. In particular, it is still not clear what the best strategy for assessing sleep parameters is in athletes and may likely depend on factors intrinsic to the sport or activity. Additionally, it is not known if standard approaches should be adapted. There is also a lack of trials of sleep interventions thought to positively impact sleep, and still an insufficient number of studies describing how improving sleep can improve performance. Still, there is a large and growing body of evidence that clearly establishes sleep health as an important factor in sport.\n\nImproving sleep in athletes through sleep education at every level of sports organisations has significant implications for health, athletic performance, academic performance and beyond, given the influence each athlete has on the general population as role model. This will not only provide an opportunity to explore a crucial aspect of mental and physical health, but it will also pave the way for new interventions in the area of mental wellbeing. Tracking sleep through questionnaires, wearables and other objective devices is promising but there is still a lot of question marks remaining. It is therefore crucial to develop strategies to mitigate sleep difficulties, not only for physical performance, but also for mental well-being, which will require additional data for a better understanding of the science of sleep.\n\n## KEY POINTS.\n- Insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality are prevalent among athletes, potentially due to time demands, physical demands, and developmental needs.\n- Sleep disturbances among athletes adversely impacts physical performance, mental performance, injury risk and recovery, medical health, and mental health.\n- Sleep interventions among athletes have been shown to improve physical strength and speed, cognitive performance and reaction time, mental health, and other domains.\n- Sport organizations should incorporate sleep health promotion programs at individual, team, and system levels.\n\n## SYNOPSIS.\n\nPrevious research has characterised the sleep of elite athletes and has attempted to identify factors associated with athletic performance, cognition, health and mental well-being. Sleep is considered a fundamental component to performance optimization among elite athletes. Yet, sleep has only recently been embraced by sport organizations as an important part of the training and recovery process. Not only does sleep play a crucial role in physical and cognitive performance, it is also an important factor in reducing the risk of injury. Yet, there are still many gaps in the literature regarding how sleep can be optimized and what the mechanisms are that link sleep and circadian rhythms to performance and recovery. This article aims to highlight the prevalence of poor sleep, describe its impacts, and address the issue of sport culture surrounding healthy sleep.\n\n## DISCLOSURE STATEMENT\n\nDr. Grandner has received grants from Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Nexalin Technology, and Kemin Foods.

          "snippet": "## Abstract\nSprint interval training (SIT) is a time-efficient type of endurance training that involves large type 2 muscle fibre recruitment. Effective antioxidant supplementation may mitigate positive training adaptations by limiting the oxidant challenge. Our aim was to test whether SIT affects type 2 more than type 1 muscle fibres, and whether the muscular training response is mitigated by antioxidant treatment.\n\n\u2026\n\nVitamin treatment decreased the upregulation of genes for ROS sensors and inflammatory regulators during the first SIT session. The 3 weeks of SIT caused generally larger proteome adaptations in type 2 than in type 1 fibres, and this included larger increases in abundance of proteins involved in mitochondrial energy production. Vitamin treatment blunted the SIT-induced proteome adaptations, whereas it did not affect the training-induced improvement in maximal cycling performance.\nIn conclusion, (i) the large type 2 fibre recruitment and resulting proteome adaptations are instrumental to the effectiveness of SIT and (ii) antioxidant supplementation counteracts positive muscular adaptations to SIT, which would blunt any improvement in submaximal endurance performance, whereas it does not affect the improvement in maximal cycling performance, where O~2~ delivery to muscle would be limiting.\nKEY POINTS: Sprint interval training (SIT) is a time-efficient type of endurance training that involves large recruitment of fast-twitch muscle fibres. Treatment with antioxidants may mitigate the positive effects of endurance training. Fibre type-specific proteomics performed on muscle biopsies obtained from young men before and after 3 weeks of SIT showed larger training effects in fast- than in slow-twitch fibres.\nAntioxidant treatment in the form of vitamin C and E pills counteracted the positive muscular adaptations to the 3 weeks of SIT. These results increase our understanding of why SIT is an effective endurance training regime and provide further evidence against the common belief that antioxidant supplements are beneficial in a physical exercise context.\n\n**\nKeywords:\n** antioxidants; muscle fibre types; proteomics; reactive oxygen/nitrogen species; skeletal muscle; sprint interval training.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

In a crossover design, subjects then completed DHR followed by either a FR protocol or wearing sham compression tights. Two days post-DHR, subjects repeated the RE and TT tests. Crossover visits occurred 2\u20134 weeks later. During RE tests, *V*O~2~ and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were recorded. Passive and active soreness were measured on a scale of 0 (no soreness) to 10 (extreme soreness).\n\n### Results\nEight runners (aged 31 \u00b1 7 years; four females; *V*O~2peak~ 57 \u00b1 7 ml kg^\u22121^ min^\u22121^) completed the study. Both treatment conditions experienced passive (*p* = 0.026) and active soreness (*p* = 0.012) induced by DHR. Active soreness 2 days postDHR was significantly lower after FR than after sham compression tights (*p* = 0.025). With tights, there was a trend for an increased RPE compared to pre-DHR (*p* = 0.056).\n\n\u2026\n\nParticipants reported to the laboratory for seven visits, which are outlined in Fig. 1. At the first visit, the athletes gave informed consent and underwent peak aerobic capacity (*V*O~2peak~) testing and body composition assessment. At the second visit, 2\u20137 days later, participants performed a RE test and a 3-km TT. At the third visit, which took place 2\u20134 days after visit 2, subjects completed a DHR and one recovery protocol. The athletes returned approximately 48 h later for visit 4, where they repeated the RE test and TT.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe sample size for the analysis of inflammatory markers was six. Demographic characteristics of the participants appear in Table 1. Effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s *d*) comparing the effects of FR and tights on muscle soreness and running performance variables are reported in Table 2. Foam rolling had large and positive effects on mitigating DHR-induced elevations in muscle soreness and RPE.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe main effect of treatment on active soreness was significant (*p* = 0.025), as was the effect of time (*p* = 0.012). The treatment \u00d7 time interaction was not significant (*p* = 0.102).\n\nThe significant main effect of time on passive and active soreness shows that in both recovery conditions, participants did incur soreness via the DHR. However, FR reduced active muscle soreness over time more than did wearing sham compression tights.\n\n\u2026\n\n|Tights|Pre-DHR|36.22 \u00b1 2.30|10.75 \u00b1 0.70|12.15 \u00b1 0.61| | | | | |\n| |48 h post-DHR|36.38 \u00b1 2.23|12.00 \u00b1 0.38|12.49 \u00b1 0.73| | | | | |\n\nData are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error\n\n*DHR* downhill running, *VO*~*2*~ rate of oxygen consumption, *RPE* rating of perceived exertion, *TT* time trial\n\n\u2026\n\n### Rating of perceived exertion\n\nDuring sub-maximal running, there was a trend toward a significant main effect of treatment (*p* = 0.056), with FR showing a lower RPE than tights at 48 h post-DHR, and the main effect of time was significant (*p* = 0.014). There was not a significant treatment \u00d7 time interaction (*p* = 0.121). Interestingly, the percent change in RPE in the higher-intensity stage after the sham tights protocol was large and positive while the change after FR was small and negative; however, this result was not statistically significant.\n\n### Time trial\n\nTime trial performance pre- and post-DHR did not differ significantly between conditions. The main effect of treatment was not significant (*p* = 0.183), although there was a trend toward a main effect of time (*p* = 0.072). The interaction between treatment and time was not significant (*p* = 0.664). With both recovery conditions, participants tended to run more slowly in the post-DHR TT, but using FR as opposed to sham compression tights did not mitigate increases in TT time.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Discussion\nIn the present study, we found that FR significantly improves conditions of soreness following DHR. This mitigation may be associated with a lower perceived exertion during submaximal running. Despite the lack of statistical significance in the effect of FR on preventing a soreness-related increase in sub-maximal RPE, the difference between RPE after using FR and wearing sham compression tights was large, as expressed using Cohen\u2019s *d*.",

Also, intake duration is suggested for creatine and \u03b2-alanine, being effective in chronic daily time < 2 weeks while caffeine, sodium bicarbonate are effective in acute daily time (1-3 hours). Plus, ingestion of nitrate supplement is required in both chronic daily time < 28 days and acute daily time (2- 2.5 h) prior exercise.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Timing and Dose of Creatine Ingestion\n\nCreatine storage can be augmented by 2 common methods of creatine supplementation including a loading phase with ingestion of 20-25 g creatine (0.3 g/kg day) (almost every 4 hours) for 5-7 days , followed by ~3-5 g (0.03 g/kg day) per day thereafter as a maintenance dose.",

Let me compile this into the complete knowledge base document.\n\n---\n\n# Hyrox Daily Nutrition & Recovery Knowledge Base\n## 16-Week Preparation Program \u2014 Evidence-Based Guide\n\n---\n\n## 1. Daily Macronutrient Framework\n\n### 1.1 Estimating Caloric Needs\n\nFor an athlete training 10\u201312 hours/week across running, strength, and HIIT, total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) typically falls in the range of **40\u201350 kcal/kg/day** (Thomas et al., 2016 \u2014 AND/DoC/ACSM Joint Position Statement). For our reference 82 kg male athlete:\n\n| Day Type | Multiplier | Estimated TDEE |\n|---|---|---|\n| Heavy Training Day (2+ hrs) | 45\u201350 kcal/kg | **3,700\u20134,100 kcal** |\n| Moderate Training Day (60\u201390 min) | 40\u201345 kcal/kg | **3,280\u20133,700 kcal** |\n| Rest/Recovery Day | 30\u201335 kcal/kg | **2,460\u20132,870 kcal** |\n\n**Practical estimation method:**\n1. Calculate BMR using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation: (10 \u00d7 weight in kg) + (6.25 \u00d7 height in cm) \u2212 (5 \u00d7 age) \u2212 5 for males.\n2. Multiply by an activity factor of 1.6\u20131.9 depending on training volume that day.\n3. Add the thermic effect of exercise using MET values for the specific session.\n\n**Body Recomposition Approach:**\nIf the goal is to optimise body composition while maintaining performance, a **small caloric deficit of 200\u2013300 kcal/day on rest days** while eating at maintenance or a slight surplus on training days is the most evidence-supported approach (Helms et al., 2014, JISSN). Aggressive deficits (>500 kcal/day) impair recovery, increase injury risk, and blunt training adaptations. The key is to prioritise protein, train hard, and let body composition improve gradually over the 16-week block. A rate of fat loss exceeding ~0.5 kg/week risks lean mass loss (Garthe et al., 2011).\n\n---\n\n### 1.2 Protein\n\n**Daily Intake Target:** The ISSN Position Stand on Protein and Exercise (J\u00e4ger et al., 2017) recommends **1.4\u20132.0 g/kg/day** for exercising individuals. For concurrent endurance + strength training athletes, the evidence supports the **upper end of this range: 1.8\u20132.2 g/kg/day**. This is because:\n\n- Endurance exercise increases amino acid oxidation during prolonged sessions.\n- Strength training requires substrate for muscle protein synthesis (MPS).\n- The concurrent training interference effect can be partially mitigated by adequate protein provision (Shamim et al., cited in PMC11688070; Baar, 2014 \u2014 GSSI SSE #136).\n\n**For our 82 kg athlete:** **148\u2013180 g protein/day** (targeting ~2.0 g/kg = 164 g/day).\n\n**Protein Distribution:**\n\n| Parameter | Recommendation | Source |\n|---|---|---|\n| Meals per day | 4\u20135 protein feedings | ISSN, 2017 |\n| Protein per meal/snack | 0.25\u20130.4 g/kg (20\u201340 g) | Morton et al., 2018 meta-analysis |\n| Meal spacing | Every 3\u20134 hours | ISSN, 2017 |\n| Leucine per meal | 2.5\u20133.0 g (threshold for maximal MPS) | ISSN, 2017 |\n\n**Timing Considerations:**\n- The \"anabolic window\" is **not** a narrow 30-minute period. The post-exercise elevation in MPS lasts **at least 24 hours**, though it diminishes progressively (J\u00e4ger et al., 2017). Consuming 20\u201340 g of high-quality protein **within 0\u20132 hours post-exercise** is beneficial but not urgent if a meal is consumed within a few hours.\n- **Pre-sleep protein:** Research by Snijders et al. (2015) and Res et al. (2012) demonstrated that ~30\u201340 g of casein before sleep increases overnight MPS and may augment muscle mass/strength gains during prolonged training. However, this benefit appears to be primarily about **increasing total daily protein intake** rather than a unique property of pre-sleep timing per se (J\u00e4ger et al., 2017). If total daily protein is already adequate across 4\u20135 meals, adding pre-sleep casein is a marginal optimisation, not a requirement.\n\n**Plant-Based Athlete Considerations:**\n- Plant proteins are generally lower in leucine and may have lower digestibility (DIAAS scores).\n- Recommendation: Increase total daily protein to **2.0\u20132.4 g/kg/day** to compensate, combine complementary protein sources (e.g., rice + pea), and consider adding leucine (2.5 g) to plant-based meals to achieve the leucine threshold. Soy protein is the highest-quality single plant source but lacks methionine.\n\n---\n\n### 1.3 Carbohydrates\n\nCarbohydrates are the **primary fuel** for the high-intensity work that defines Hyrox (running intervals, sled pushes, rowing, wall balls). The ACSM/AND/DoC Joint Position Statement (Thomas et al., 2016) and Burke et al. provide the following framework:\n\n| Training Day Type | Carb Target (g/kg/day) | For 82 kg athlete |\n|---|---|---|\n| Light/Recovery day | 3\u20135 g/kg | 246\u2013410 g |\n| Moderate training (60 min) | 5\u20137 g/kg | 410\u2013574 g |\n| High-volume day (90\u2013120 min) | 6\u20138 g/kg | 492\u2013656 g |\n| Race-week carb loading | 8\u201312 g/kg | 656\u2013984 g |\n\n**Carb Periodization for Hyrox:**\n\n- **High-carb days** should align with long runs (>60 min), heavy strength sessions, and HIIT days. These sessions are glycogen-dependent.\n- **Moderate-carb days** suit easier recovery runs and lighter gym sessions.\n- **Low-carb training** (\"train low\") is a strategy sometimes used by endurance athletes to enhance fat oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis. However, for Hyrox athletes, this is generally **inappropriate** because: (1) Hyrox is primarily a glycolytic event (60\u201390 min at high intensity); (2) training in a glycogen-depleted state can activate AMPK, which may interfere with mTOR signalling and blunt strength adaptations (Baar, 2014 \u2014 GSSI); (3) it impairs session quality. If used at all, restrict it to one easy, low-intensity aerobic session per week during base-building, and never before or during strength or HIIT sessions.\n\n**Pre-Workout Carbohydrate:**\n\n| Timing | Amount | Examples |\n|---|---|---|\n| 3\u20134 hours before | 1\u20134 g/kg (82\u2013328 g) | Large mixed meal: oats, toast, fruit, eggs |\n| 1\u20132 hours before | 1\u20132 g/kg (82\u2013164 g) | Smaller meal: banana + toast + honey |\n| 30\u201360 min before | 0.5\u20131 g/kg (40\u201382 g) | Banana, energy bar, white rice |\n\nSource: Thomas et al., 2016; Naderi et al., 2023 (Nutrients review).\n\n**AM vs PM sessions:** For AM sessions, consume a moderate pre-workout meal 60\u201390 minutes before (e.g., oats with banana, ~60\u201380 g carbs). For PM sessions, ensure adequate carb intake across breakfast and lunch to optimise glycogen stores.\n\n**Intra-Workout Carbs:**\n- Sessions **<60 minutes:** Not necessary. A carbohydrate mouth rinse can provide a small performance benefit via central nervous system signalling, but caloric intake is not physiologically required.\n- Sessions **60\u201390 minutes:** 30\u201360 g/hr of carbohydrate is beneficial (Jeukendrup, 2014).\n- Sessions **>90 minutes:** 60\u201390 g/hr using a glucose:fructose blend (2:1 ratio) to maximise absorption via dual intestinal transporters (Jeukendrup, 2014; Naderi et al., 2023).\n\n**Post-Workout Carb Replenishment:**\n- Consume **1.0\u20131.2 g/kg** of carbohydrate in the first 1\u20132 hours post-exercise when there is another session within 8 hours.\n- High-GI carbs (white rice, potatoes, bread) are preferred for rapid glycogen resynthesis (Burke et al., 1993; Wong et al., 2009).\n- When the next session is >24 hours away, total daily carb intake matters more than immediate post-workout timing (Namma-Motonaga et al., 2022).\n- Co-ingesting protein with carbohydrate does not enhance glycogen synthesis beyond what equal-calorie carbohydrate alone provides, but it does support MPS (Margolis et al., 2021 meta-analysis).\n\n---\n\n### 1.4 Fats\n\n| Parameter | Recommendation |\n|---|---|\n| **Minimum for hormonal health** | 0.5 g/kg/day (approximately 20% of total calories) |\n| **Optimal range** | 1.0\u20131.5 g/kg/day (25\u201335% of total calories) |\n| **For 82 kg athlete** | 82\u2013123 g/day |\n\nGoing below 20% of total calories from fat chronically can impair testosterone production, menstrual function, and absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (Thomas et al., 2016).\n\n**Timing around workouts:** Fat slows gastric emptying. Avoid high-fat meals **within 1\u20132 hours pre-workout** to prevent GI discomfort. Post-workout, fat does not impair glycogen resynthesis or MPS, so including moderate fat in post-workout meals is fine (e.g., eggs, avocado).\n\n**Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** A combined EPA/DHA intake of **1\u20133 g/day** is supported for reducing exercise-induced inflammation, supporting cardiovascular health, and potentially improving muscle protein synthesis (Philpott et al., 2019 meta-analysis). Dietary sources include fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, sardines). If intake is inadequate, supplementation is warranted (see Section 3).\n\n---\n\n### 1.5 Sample Day of Eating: HIGH-TRAINING DAY (82 kg Male)\n\n**Training: AM Run (75 min) + PM Gym Session (60 min)**\n**Target: ~3,800 kcal | ~164 g protein | ~530 g carbs | ~100 g fat**\n\n| Time | Meal | Food | Macros (approx.) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **6:00 AM** | Pre-Run Snack | 1 large banana (30g C) + 1 slice white toast w/ honey (30g C) + 250 ml water | 60g C, 2g P, 1g F = ~255 kcal |\n| **8:00 AM** | Post-Run Breakfast | 100g oats w/ 300 ml milk + 1 scoop whey (25g P) + 1 tbsp peanut butter + 1 banana + handful blueberries | 95g C, 45g P, 22g F = ~755 kcal |\n| **11:00 AM** | Mid-Morning Snack | Greek yogurt (200g) + 40g granola + drizzle of honey | 50g C, 20g P, 8g F = ~350 kcal |\n| **1:00 PM** | Lunch | 200g cooked white rice + 150g grilled chicken breast + mixed vegetables saut\u00e9ed in olive oil (1 tbsp) + avocado (\u00bd) | 90g C, 50g P, 25g F = ~785 kcal |\n| **3:30 PM** | Pre-Gym Snack | 2 rice cakes w/ jam + 1 banana | 55g C, 3g P, 1g F = ~240 kcal |\n| **5:30 PM** | Post-Gym Shake | 1.5 scoops whey protein + 350 ml milk + 1 banana + 40g oats blended | 70g C, 42g P, 10g F = ~540 kcal |\n| **7:30 PM** | Dinner | 200g cooked pasta + 150g lean beef mince in tomato sauce + side salad w/ olive oil dressing + parmesan | 80g C, 48g P, 22g F = ~710 kcal |\n| **9:30 PM** | Pre-Sleep | 250g cottage cheese (or 40g casein protein) + 30g walnuts | 8g C, 35g P, 18g F = ~330 kcal |\n| | **TOTALS** | | **~508g C, ~245g P (high), ~107g F \u2248 ~3,965 kcal** |\n\n*Note: Protein exceeds minimum target \u2014 this is fine.

Calories are reduced ~25\u201330% from high-training days.*\n\n---\n\n## 2. Hydration Protocol\n\n### 2.1 Daily Hydration\n\n**Baseline fluid intake:** A practical starting point is **30\u201340 ml per kg of body weight per day** as baseline hydration (excluding exercise losses). For an 82 kg athlete: **2.5\u20133.3 litres/day** of baseline fluid.\n\n**Assessing hydration status:**\n\n| Method | Target | Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n| Urine colour | Pale straw/light yellow | First void of the day is most indicative |\n| Body weight | \u22641% change AM-to-AM | Weigh upon waking after voiding |\n| Thirst | Not thirsty upon waking | A simple but valid indicator in most athletes |\n| Urine frequency | Every 2\u20134 hours during waking | ACSM guideline |\n\n**Daily electrolyte targets for heavy-training athletes:**\n\n| Electrolyte | Daily Target | Key Sources |\n|---|---|---|\n| Sodium | 2,000\u20134,000 mg | Salt in food, electrolyte drinks, broth |\n| Potassium | 3,500\u20134,700 mg | Bananas, potatoes, leafy greens, dairy |\n| Magnesium | 400\u2013600 mg | Nuts, seeds, dark leafy greens, dark chocolate |\n\nSource: AND/ACSM guidelines; Precision Hydration; GSSI recommendations.\n\n**When to use electrolyte drinks vs plain water:**\n- Sessions <60 min in moderate conditions: **plain water** is sufficient.\n- Sessions >60 min, high-intensity sessions, or hot/humid conditions: use an **electrolyte drink** containing 300\u2013800 mg sodium per litre.\n- Heavy sweaters or salty sweaters (white salt residue on clothing): prioritise sodium-containing drinks during and after training.\n\n---\n\n### 2.2 Training Hydration\n\n**Pre-Training:**\n- Consume **5\u20137 ml/kg** of fluid 2\u20134 hours before exercise (410\u2013575 ml for 82 kg athlete) (ACSM Position Stand, Sawka et al., 2007).\n- Include **~500 mg sodium** with the pre-exercise fluid, especially before intense or hot-weather sessions (ACSM fact sheet). This can be as simple as salting breakfast foods.\n\n**During Training:**\n\n| Session Type | Fluid Intake Rate |\n|---|---|\n| Strength session (60 min, indoors) | 200\u2013400 ml/hr (sipping between sets) |\n| Moderate run (45\u201360 min) | 400\u2013600 ml/hr |\n| Long run / HIIT (60\u201390+ min) | 500\u2013800 ml/hr (individualised to sweat rate) |\n\n**General rule:** Replace 50\u201380% of sweat losses during exercise. Do **not** aim for 100% replacement during exercise \u2014 overhydration and hyponatremia are real risks.\n\n**Post-Training Rehydration:**\n- Consume **1.25\u20131.5 litres of fluid per kg of body weight lost** during the session (ACSM, 2007).\n- Include sodium (electrolyte drink, salty foods) to improve fluid retention.\n- Consume gradually over 2\u20134 hours post-exercise.\n\n**Practical Sweat Rate Estimation:**\n\n1. Weigh yourself nude before exercise (Body Mass PRE).\n2. Exercise for a measured duration (e.g., 60 min).\n3. Track all fluid consumed during exercise.\n4. Weigh yourself nude after exercise (Body Mass POST).\n5. **Sweat rate (L/hr)** = (Body Mass PRE \u2212 Body Mass POST + Fluid Intake \u2212 Urine Output) \u00f7 Exercise Duration in hours.\n\nTypical sweat rates range from **0.5\u20132.0 L/hr** depending on intensity, fitness level, and environment (Baker, 2017 \u2014 GSSI SSE #161). Repeat this test in different conditions (summer vs winter, easy vs hard sessions).\n\n---\n\n### 2.3 Hydration Schedule: Sample Training Day\n\n| Time | Action | Volume |\n|---|---|---|\n| 6:00 AM (wake) | Water upon rising | 500 ml |\n| 6:00\u20137:00 AM | Sip water with breakfast (add pinch of salt) | 250\u2013400 ml |\n| 7:00 AM (pre-run) | Final sip 15 min before run | 150\u2013200 ml |\n| During run (75 min) | Water or electrolyte drink every 15\u201320 min | 400\u2013600 ml total |\n| 8:15 AM (post-run) | Rehydrate with electrolyte-containing fluid + breakfast | 500\u2013750 ml over 1 hr |\n| 10:00 AM\u20133:00 PM | Sip water steadily across meals/snacks | 750\u20131,000 ml |\n| 3:30 PM (pre-gym) | Pre-session hydration check | 300\u2013400 ml |\n| During gym (60 min) | Water between sets | 300\u2013500 ml |\n| 5:00 PM (post-gym) | Rehydrate with fluid + post-workout shake | 500 ml |\n| 5:00\u20139:30 PM | Steady sipping with dinner, tapering before bed | 500\u2013750 ml |\n| **Daily Total** | | **~4.0\u20135.0 L** |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence-Based Supplements\n\n### Tier 1 \u2014 Strong Evidence\n\n| Supplement | What It Does | Dosage | Timing | Evidence | Hyrox Application |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **Creatine Monohydrate** | Increases phosphocreatine stores \u2192 faster ATP regeneration during high-intensity efforts; supports lean mass gains | Loading: 20 g/day (4 \u00d7 5 g) for 5\u20137 days; Maintenance: 3\u20135 g/day (or 0.03 g/kg/day) | Daily with a meal (timing is flexible; consistency matters most) | **Strong** \u2014 ISSN Position Stand (Kreider et al., 2017); one of the most researched supplements in sports science with >500 peer-reviewed studies | Directly benefits sled push/pull, wall balls, burpee broad jumps, and repeat sprint capacity. Also supports muscle mass during concurrent training. Safe for long-term use. |\n| **Caffeine** | Blocks adenosine receptors \u2192 reduces perceived exertion and pain; enhances endurance and focus | 3\u20136 mg/kg body weight (250\u2013500 mg for 82 kg athlete) | 30\u201360 min before training/competition | **Strong** \u2014 ISSN Position Stand (Goldstein et al., 2010); AND/DoC/ACSM endorsed | Enhances both the running segments and station performance. Use strategically (not daily at high doses) to prevent habituation, though evidence on habituation's effect is mixed (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2017). Reserve highest doses for key sessions and race day. |\n| **Vitamin D** | Maintains bone health, immune function, muscle function; deficiency impairs performance and recovery | 1,000\u20134,000 IU/day depending on blood levels; target serum 25(OH)D \u2265 40 ng/ml (100 nmol/L) | Daily with a fat-containing meal | **Strong** for deficiency correction \u2014 NIH ODS; Owens et al., 2018 | Indoor-training athletes and those at northern latitudes are at high risk of deficiency. Get 25(OH)D levels tested. Supplement year-round if below 30 ng/ml. |\n| **Protein Powder (Whey/Casein)** | Convenient complete protein source to help meet daily targets; whey is fast-absorbing, casein is slow-absorbing | 20\u201340 g per serving as needed to meet daily protein goals | Post-workout (whey), pre-sleep (casein), or whenever convenient | **Strong** \u2014 ISSN, 2017; Not superior to whole food protein, but practically useful | A tool, not a requirement. Useful when whole-food meals are impractical (e.g., immediately post-workout). Whey provides ~25% leucine by amino acid weight \u2014 highest of any protein source. |\n\n### Tier 2 \u2014 Moderate Evidence\n\n| Supplement | What It Does | Dosage | Timing | Evidence | Hyrox Application |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **Beta-Alanine** | Increases muscle carnosine \u2192 buffers hydrogen ions \u2192 delays fatigue in 1\u201310 min high-intensity efforts | 3.2\u20136.4 g/day in divided doses (800 mg \u00d7 4\u20138 servings) for minimum 4 weeks | Daily with meals (loading effect, not acute) | **Moderate** \u2014 ISSN Position Stand (Trexler et al., 2015); meta-analysis shows benefit for exercise lasting 60s\u201310 min | Hyrox stations involve repeated 1\u20133 min high-intensity bouts. Carnosine buffering could meaningfully reduce fatigue during sled work, rowing, and wall balls. Expect tingling (paraesthesia) \u2014 harmless. Use sustained-release formulations to minimise this. |\n| **Sodium Bicarbonate** | Alkaline buffer \u2192 enhances disposal of hydrogen ions from high-intensity anaerobic work | 0.2\u20130.3 g/kg, 60\u2013120 min before high-intensity sessions | Acute, pre-session (use serially during specific prep phases to test tolerance) | **Moderate** \u2014 Multiple reviews and meta-analyses; individual responses vary | Could benefit Hyrox race performance (sustained high-intensity for 60\u201390 min). GI distress is the major limitation \u2014 **must** be trialled extensively in training. Take with carbohydrate-rich food and divide into smaller doses over 60 min. |\n| **Beetroot Juice / Nitrates** | Increases nitric oxide \u2192 vasodilation \u2192 improved oxygen efficiency; reduces O\u2082 cost of submaximal exercise | 6.4\u201312.8 mmol nitrate (typically 500 ml beetroot juice or ~140 ml concentrated shot) | 2\u20133 hours before exercise; or daily for 3\u20137 days prior to competition | **Moderate** \u2014 AND/DoC/ACSM endorsed; greater benefit in recreational vs elite athletes | May improve running economy during the 8 km of running in Hyrox. Benefit is more likely in sub-elite athletes (which most Hyrox competitors are). May also enhance blood flow to working muscles during station work. |\n| **Omega-3 Fatty Acids** | Anti-inflammatory; may support MPS, cardiovascular health, and recovery | 1\u20133 g/day combined EPA + DHA | Daily with meals | **Moderate** \u2014 Philpott et al., 2019; McGlory et al., 2019 | Supports recovery between high-volume training sessions. May reduce exercise-induced muscle soreness (modest effect). Helps maintain joint health during high-impact running. Choose high-quality, third-party tested products. |\n\n### Tier 3 \u2014 Weak or Mixed Evidence\n\n| Supplement | What It Does | Dosage | Timing | Evidence | Verdict |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **BCAAs/EAAs** | Provide branched-chain amino acids for MPS | 10\u201315 g BCAAs or 10\u201315 g EAAs | Pre/during/post training | **Weak** \u2014 Unnecessary if total daily protein (from complete proteins) is adequate; BCAAs alone cannot maximally stimulate MPS without all EAAs (ISSN, 2017) | **Skip** if eating \u22651.6 g/kg protein from complete sources. Only useful in a fasted training scenario or if protein intake is low. EAAs are marginally better than BCAAs if supplementation is warranted. |\n| **Collagen Peptides** | May support tendon, ligament, and cartilage health via increased collagen synthesis | 10\u201315 g + 50 mg vitamin C | 30\u201360 min before rehab/prehab exercise | **Weak-to-Moderate** \u2014 Shaw et al., 2017 (small study); mechanism plausible but large-scale evidence lacking | Potentially useful for **joint health** in a Hyrox athlete doing high-impact running + sled work. Low risk. Consider during phases of increased joint stress or if experiencing tendon issues. Not a performance supplement. |\n| **Ashwagandha** | Adaptogen; may reduce cortisol, improve recovery, modestly increase strength and VO\u2082max | 300\u2013600 mg/day of root extract (KSM-66 or Sensoril) | Daily, any time | **Weak-to-Moderate** \u2014 Some positive RCTs for strength and VO\u2082max (Choudhary et al., 2015; Wankhede et al., 2015), but evidence is limited and effect sizes are small | May provide marginal benefits in stress management during heavy training blocks. Not harmful. Not a priority. |\n| **Tart Cherry Juice** | Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant polyphenols; may reduce DOMS and accelerate strength recovery | 30\u201360 ml concentrate or 480 ml juice, twice daily | During heavy training blocks; begin 4\u20135 days before target event | **Weak-to-Moderate** \u2014 Some positive results for reducing soreness (Bell et al., 2016; Levers et al., 2016), but studies are small with varied protocols | May slightly reduce soreness after particularly demanding sessions. Use judiciously \u2014 chronic high-dose antioxidant intake may blunt training adaptations (see below). Best reserved for competition week or recovery weeks. |\n\n### What to AVOID\n\n| Category | Specifics | Reason |\n|---|---|---|\n| **High-dose antioxidants (Vitamin C >1,000 mg/day + Vitamin E >400 IU/day)** | These interfere with reactive oxygen species signalling necessary for training adaptation | Paulsen et al. (2014) showed blunted endurance and strength adaptations; recent 2025 study confirmed antioxidant supplementation \"counteracts positive muscular adaptations\" to sprint interval training. **Do not take mega-dose vitamins C and E during training blocks.** |\n| **Testosterone boosters** (Tribulus terrestris, DHEA, D-aspartic acid) | No evidence of efficacy; DHEA is banned by WADA; Tribulus has no effect on testosterone in RCTs | Australian Institute of Sport recommends against. Save your money. |\n| **Proprietary \"pre-workout\" blends** with undisclosed doses | May contain harmful stimulants (DMAA, DMBA); doses of active ingredients often subtherapeutic or excessive | ISSN recommends against proprietary blends. Use individual, evidence-based ingredients at known doses instead. |\n| **Fat burners / thermogenics** | Often contain excessive caffeine, synephrine, or other stimulants with poor evidence and cardiovascular risk | Not appropriate for performance athletes. Body composition should be managed through diet and training. |\n| **Excessive NSAID use** (ibuprofen, naproxen) as a recovery tool | Chronic NSAID use impairs muscle protein synthesis, tendon healing, and bone remodelling | Limit to acute injury management only, not routine post-training recovery. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Sleep Optimisation\n\n### 4.1 Duration Targets\n\nFor an athlete training 10\u201312 hours/week, the research strongly supports **8\u201310 hours of sleep per night**. The IOC (Reardon et al., 2019) and NCAA position statements define a minimum of 7 hours for adults, but athletes typically require more. The most frequently cited recommendation for sleep extension in athletes is to increase sleep by **46\u2013113 minutes** above habitual ~7 hr baselines (meta-analysis by Bonnar et al.; Vitale et al., 2019).\n\n**Quantified performance impacts of insufficient sleep:**\n\n| Sleep Deficit | Performance Impact |\n|---|---|\n| <6 hours for 1 night | 15 watts reduced power output in cyclists (Mougin et al., 2001); reaction time impaired |\n| <7 hours for 1 night | 1.7\u00d7 increased injury risk in adolescent athletes (Milewski et al., 2014) |\n| Chronic ~6.5 hrs (athlete average) | Reduced glycogen restorage, elevated cortisol, increased perceived exertion (Charest & Grandner, 2020) |\n| Sleep extension to 10 hrs | Improved sprint times, reaction time, shooting accuracy, and mood in collegiate athletes (Mah et al., 2011) |\n\n### 4.2 Sleep Quality Metrics\n\n| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |\n|---|---|---|\n| Sleep efficiency | >85% (time asleep \u00f7 time in bed) | Low efficiency indicates fragmented sleep |\n| Sleep onset latency | <20 minutes | Indicates appropriate sleep pressure and low hyperarousal |\n| Wake after sleep onset (WASO) | <30 minutes total | Excessive waking disrupts deep sleep and REM |\n| Deep sleep (SWS) | 15\u201325% of total sleep time | Critical for growth hormone release, muscle repair, glycogen restorage |\n| REM sleep | 20\u201325% of total sleep time | Critical for motor learning, memory consolidation, emotional regulation |\n| Consistency | \u00b130 min bedtime/wake time daily | Irregular schedules disrupt circadian rhythm and reduce sleep efficiency |\n\n### 4.3 Evidence-Based Pre-Bed Routine\n\n1. **Set a consistent sleep/wake schedule** (\u00b130 min, even on weekends) \u2014 this is the single most impactful intervention.\n2. **Dim lights 60\u201390 min before bed** \u2014 reduces cortisol and promotes melatonin secretion.\n3. **Avoid screens or use blue-light filtering** from 60 min pre-bed.\n4. **Cool the bedroom** to 18\u201320\u00b0C (65\u201368\u00b0F) \u2014 core body temperature drop initiates sleep onset.\n5. **Pre-sleep nutrition:** A small casein-rich snack (cottage cheese, Greek yogurt, or casein shake) can support overnight MPS without disrupting sleep. A high-GI carbohydrate at dinner may improve sleep onset latency (Vlahoyiannis et al., 2018).\n6. **Magnesium supplementation** (200\u2013400 mg magnesium glycinate or threonate) 30\u201360 min before bed may improve subjective sleep quality \u2014 evidence is moderate (Abbasi et al., 2012).\n7. **Caffeine curfew:** Avoid caffeine at least **6 hours before bed** (ideally 8\u201310 hours). Caffeine has a half-life of ~5 hours but high individual variability exists (Drake et al., 2013).\n\n### 4.4 Napping\n\n| Recommendation | Details |\n|---|---|\n| Ideal nap duration | **20\u201330 min** (power nap) or **90 min** (full sleep cycle) |\n| Avoid | 40\u201360 min naps \u2192 increased sleep inertia (grogginess on waking) |\n| Best timing | Early-to-mid afternoon (1:00\u20133:00 PM) to align with natural circadian dip |\n| After poor night | A 20\u201390 min nap can restore performance to baseline levels (PMC10354314) |\n| Caution | Napping after 3:00 PM or for >90 min can impair night-time sleep onset |\n\n### 4.5 Sleep After PM Training\n\nAthletes who train in the evening frequently report difficulty falling asleep due to elevated core temperature, sympathetic nervous system activation, and elevated cortisol/adrenaline. Practical strategies:\n\n- Allow **\u22652\u20133 hours** between high-intensity exercise cessation and bed.\n- Use a cool shower (not ice cold \u2014 comfortably cool) post-workout to accelerate core temperature reduction.\n- Keep post-workout nutrition low in caffeine (no pre-workout supplements for PM sessions).\n- Use a structured cool-down (10 min easy walking + stretching) to initiate parasympathetic activation.\n- Consider relaxation techniques: progressive muscle relaxation, box breathing (4-4-4-4), or guided meditation apps.\n- If PM training consistently impairs sleep, consider shifting the hardest sessions to AM/midday when possible.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Recovery Modalities \u2014 Evidence Review\n\n| Modality | Evidence Quality | When to Use | How to Use |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Foam Rolling / Self-Myofascial Release** | **Moderate** \u2014 Meta-analysis (Wiewelhove et al., 2019) shows small reductions in DOMS and small improvements in sprint performance and flexibility | Daily or post-training; particularly after runs and lower-body sessions | 60\u2013120 seconds per muscle group. Slow, sustained pressure on quads, hamstrings, IT band, calves, thoracic spine. Does not \"break up\" fascia \u2014 likely works via neurological pain modulation and increased blood flow. |\n| **Static Stretching** | **Weak for performance; Moderate for flexibility** \u2014 Pre-exercise static stretching >60s per muscle can transiently reduce strength/power. No consistent evidence for injury prevention or DOMS reduction. | Post-workout cool-down or evening routine; **not** immediately pre-exercise | 15\u201330 seconds per stretch, 2\u20133 sets. Focus on chronically tight areas (hip flexors, calves, hamstrings). |\n| **Dynamic Stretching** | **Strong for warm-up** \u2014 Improves range of motion, activates neuromuscular pathways, and enhances subsequent performance | Pre-every-session as part of warm-up | 5\u201310 min of movement-specific dynamic stretches: leg swings, walking lunges, arm circles, inchworms, hip circles. |\n| **Cold Water Immersion (CWI) / Ice Baths** | **Moderate for acute soreness recovery** \u2014 Meta-analyses (Moore et al., 2023; Machado et al., 2016) show CWI reduces DOMS and creatine kinase more than passive recovery. **However**, chronic CWI post-resistance training may blunt muscle hypertrophy and strength adaptations (Roberts et al., 2015). | After extremely demanding sessions (race simulations, competition), **not** after regular strength training | 10\u201315 min at 10\u201315\u00b0C. Use strategically, not habitually. Reserve for competition recovery or when 2 high-intensity sessions occur within 24 hours. Avoid after strength sessions during hypertrophy phases. |\n| **Contrast Water Therapy (Hot/Cold)** | **Weak-to-Moderate** \u2014 May enhance perceived recovery and reduce DOMS versus passive recovery, but evidence is less strong than for CWI alone (Moore et al., 2023) | Can use when ice bath is impractical; good psychological benefit | Alternate 1 min cold (10\u201315\u00b0C) / 2 min warm (38\u201340\u00b0C) for 12\u201315 min total, ending on cold. |\n| **Sauna / Heat Exposure** | **Moderate for health; Weak for direct performance recovery** \u2014 Regular sauna use improves cardiovascular health (Laukkanen et al., 2015), may stimulate heat shock proteins, and can enhance plasma volume (heat acclimation). Does not directly reduce DOMS. | 2\u20133 sessions per week; useful as a cardiovascular and relaxation tool, and for heat acclimation if racing in warm conditions | 15\u201320 min at 80\u2013100\u00b0C (traditional Finnish) or 30\u201340 min at 55\u201365\u00b0C (infrared). Rehydrate aggressively after (500 ml+ fluid with electrolytes). Avoid immediately post-strength training during hypertrophy phases (similar blunting concern as CWI). |\n| **Compression Garments** | **Weak-to-Moderate** \u2014 Systematic review (Engel et al., 2016) found small positive effects on DOMS reduction and perceived recovery. Mechanism likely relates to reduced swelling via compression and improved venous return. | Wear during long travel, overnight post-hard sessions, or during easy recovery days | Graduated compression tights or sleeves (15\u201330 mmHg). Effect size is small but risk/cost is low. Primarily a perceptual/comfort benefit. |\n| **Massage / Percussion Devices (Theragun, etc.)** | **Moderate for soreness; Weak for performance recovery** \u2014 Massage reduces DOMS (Poppendieck et al., 2016 meta-analysis). Percussion devices are less studied but likely provide similar neurological pain modulation as massage/foam rolling. | Post-training or evening recovery routine; targeted on areas of highest soreness or tightness | Massage: 20\u201330 min sessions 1\u20132\u00d7 per week from a sports therapist. Percussion: 30\u201360 seconds per muscle group at moderate intensity. Avoid directly on joints or bony prominences. |\n| **Active Recovery (easy walking, swimming, cycling)** | **Moderate** \u2014 Low-intensity activity enhances blood flow, promotes psychological recovery, and may slightly accelerate lactate clearance. Does not impair subsequent training if truly low-intensity. | Day after hard sessions; or as a second session on double-training days | 20\u201340 min at \u226460% max HR. Walking, easy swimming, or cycling. The session should feel effortless. If heart rate is elevated or if it feels like \"work,\" it's too intense. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Nutrition Periodisation Across the 16-Week Program\n\n### Phase 1: General Preparation (Weeks 1\u20134)\n**Training focus:** Aerobic base building, progressive strength loading, movement quality.\n\n**Nutrition strategy:**\n- Calories at **maintenance to slight surplus** (+100\u2013200 kcal on training days).\n- Carbohydrates: **5\u20137 g/kg/day** \u2014 adequate to fuel increasing volume without excess.\n- Protein: **1.8\u20132.0 g/kg/day** \u2014 consistent foundation for muscle protein turnover.\n- Fat: **1.0\u20131.2 g/kg/day** \u2014 support hormonal health.\n- If body recomposition is a goal, implement the small rest-day deficit here (\u2212200\u2013300 kcal).\n- Begin creatine loading (20 g/day \u00d7 5\u20137 days, then 5 g/day maintenance).\n- Begin beta-alanine loading (3.2\u20136.4 g/day \u2014 it takes 4+ weeks to saturate muscle carnosine).\n- **Practice gut training:** Start trialling intra-workout carbs and race-day nutrition products during long sessions.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2: Specific Preparation (Weeks 5\u201310)\n**Training focus:** Increased HIIT density, Hyrox-specific station work, race-pace running.\n\n**Nutrition strategy:**\n- Calories at **maintenance or slight surplus** \u2014 this is not the time to cut; training demands are peaking.\n- Carbohydrates: **6\u20138 g/kg/day** \u2014 higher to support glycolytic HIIT work and faster glycogen turnover.\n- Protein: **2.0\u20132.2 g/kg/day** \u2014 higher to compensate for increased exercise-induced protein breakdown from concurrent high-intensity work.\n- Fat: Minimum **0.8\u20131.0 g/kg/day**.\n- Use intra-workout carbs (30\u201360 g/hr) during all sessions exceeding 60 minutes.\n- Ensure post-workout recovery nutrition is dialed in: 1.0\u20131.2 g/kg carbs + 0.3 g/kg protein within 2 hours.\n- **Discontinue any caloric deficit.** Prioritise fuelling and recovery.\n- Omega-3 supplementation (2\u20133 g EPA/DHA daily) to support inflammation management from high training load.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 3: Competition Preparation (Weeks 11\u201314)\n**Training focus:** Race simulations, pacing practice, maintaining fitness while managing fatigue.\n\n**Nutrition strategy:**\n- Calories at **full maintenance** \u2014 no deficit whatsoever.\n- Carbohydrates: **7\u20138 g/kg/day** on high-intensity days; **5\u20136 g/kg** on moderate days.\n- Protein: **1.8\u20132.0 g/kg/day** \u2014 maintenance level.\n- Trial and finalise **race-day nutrition plan:** Practice the exact pre-race meal, intra-race carb strategy, and caffeine dose during race simulations.\n- Continue creatine and beta-alanine. Begin experimenting with sodium bicarbonate (0.2\u20130.3 g/kg, 90 min pre-session) during high-intensity practice \u2014 assess GI tolerance.\n- Trial beetroot juice (140 ml concentrate or 500 ml juice) 2\u20133 hours before race simulations.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 4: Taper (Weeks 15\u201316)\n**Training focus:** Volume reduction (40\u201360% of peak), maintain intensity, sharpen race-specific speed.\n\n**Nutrition strategy:**\n\n**Week 15 (early taper):**\n- Reduce caloric intake proportionally to the **reduced training volume** \u2014 roughly a 15\u201320% reduction from peak training calories.\n- Carbohydrates: **5\u20136 g/kg/day** (reduced from peak).\n- Protein: **1.8\u20132.0 g/kg/day** \u2014 maintain; do not reduce protein during taper.\n- Sleep: Prioritise \u22659 hours/night. This is the phase where sleep extension provides the greatest performance ROI.\n- Continue all supplements at maintenance doses.\n\n**Week 16 (race week):**\n\n| Day | Nutrition Focus |\n|---|---|\n| **Mon\u2013Wed** (Race-4 to Race-2 days) | Begin **carb loading**: 8\u201310 g/kg/day. Reduce fibre and fat to accommodate high carb volume without GI distress. Protein at 1.5\u20131.8 g/kg/day. Choose familiar, easily digestible carb sources: white rice, pasta, bread, pancakes, fruit juice, honey. |\n| **Thursday** (Race-1 day) | Continue high-carb intake (8\u201310 g/kg). Final light 20\u201330 min shakeout run. Hydrate well. Include **500 mg sodium** with dinner to optimise fluid retention. Go to bed early. |\n| **Friday (Race Day \u2014 example PM race):** | |\n| Breakfast (8:00 AM) | Large high-carb meal: 2\u20133 g/kg. White toast, jam, banana, oats with honey, orange juice. Low fibre, low fat. |\n| Lunch/Snack (11:00 AM\u201312:00 PM) | Moderate meal: 1\u20131.5 g/kg carbs. White rice or pasta, lean protein, minimal fat and fibre. |\n| Pre-Race (2\u20133 hrs before start) | Final top-up: 1 g/kg carbs. Energy bar, banana, sports drink. Caffeine (3\u20136 mg/kg) 60 min before start. |\n| Intra-Race | This is covered by the existing race-day protocol in the coaching knowledge base. |\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Key Quantified Targets for the 82 kg Hyrox Athlete\n\n| Parameter | Daily Target |\n|---|---|\n| Calories (training day) | 3,700\u20134,100 kcal |\n| Calories (rest day) | 2,500\u20132,800 kcal |\n| Protein | 148\u2013180 g (1.8\u20132.2 g/kg) |\n| Carbohydrate (training) | 410\u2013656 g (5\u20138 g/kg) |\n| Carbohydrate (rest) | 246\u2013410 g (3\u20135 g/kg) |\n| Fat | 82\u2013123 g (1.0\u20131.5 g/kg) |\n| Fluid (baseline) | 2.5\u20133.3 L/day |\n| Fluid (including exercise) | 4.0\u20135.0+ L/day |\n| Sleep | 8\u201310 hours/night |\n| Creatine | 5 g/day |\n| Caffeine (training/race) | 250\u2013500 mg pre-session |\n| Omega-3 | 1\u20133 g EPA/DHA daily |\n\n---\n\n### References (Key Sources)\n\n- J\u00e4ger R et al.
