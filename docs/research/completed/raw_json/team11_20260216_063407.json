          "snippet": "1\n\n1. CONCEPT\nHYROX, an indoor mass participation fitness competition, is based on an \nidea by Upsolut Sports founder Christian Toetzke and involves a \ncombination of running and functional movements. The race and \nfollowing rulebook, was designed and written by Mintra Tilly.\nHYROX consists of a 1 km run followed by one workout, repeated 8 times. \nIn order to complete the entire HYROX race and receive a valid finishing \ntime, the participants must complete the runs and workouts in the specific \norder (run, workout, run, workout, etc.) until they have completed a total of \n8 km running and 8 workouts. Whilst the repetition range and/or weights \ndiffer between the divisions, the running distance remains the same \nacross all divisions: each participant must run 1 km before each workout, \ni.e. a total distance of 8 km.\nThe results and ranking system  are based on the fastest time in each \nrespective division. Results are sorted from the fastest to the slowest time. \nIn addition to the overall fastest mens and womens times, results are also \nranked in age groups (4.2. Age Groups), also sorted from the fastest to the \nslowest time.\n2.

ELITE 15 QUALIFICATION SYSTEM\nAs of the 2024/2025 season, the Elite 15 series will consists of:\n\u2022\nFour Major Races\n1. Amsterdam\n2. HongKong\n3. Las Vegas\n4. Glasgow\n\u2022\nLast Chance Qualifier (LCQ)\n\u2022\nThe World Championships of Fitness Racing\n7.1 Majors\nTo each Major event, 15 Male and 15 Female athletes will qualify. \nQualification to the Major events occurs via a combination of auto \nqualification through placing in previous season Elite 15 events and time \nqualification in Pro races.  \n \n7.1.2 Athletes who are automatically qualified (for all four season \n24/25 Majors)\n\u2022\nEvery Major Winner of Season 23/24 - no roll downs\n\u2022\nSeason 23/24 Worlds Podiums 1,2 and 3 - roll downs until podium 5 if a \nMajor winner is amongst the Top \nHYROX EN Doubles Rulebook R2 Season 2024/25\n 9\nH Y R O X     RULEBOOK\n\n7.1.3 Qualification by time\nThe average of the two best individual Pro times of the past 365 days until \n15 participants are reached will be used for the time qualification. This is  a \ndynamic ranking that will be updated with each race to always reflect the \npast 365 days from that particular date. Times achieved in Major races will \nbe included in this ranking.\n \n7.1.4 Qualification via Major races \nThe winner of each Major earns an auto qualification slot for the remaining \nMajors of the current as well as the upcoming season - no roll downs.\nPodiums 1, 2 and 3 of each Major event directly qualify the athlete for the \nElite 15 race at Worlds - if these athletes have already qualified, the slot \nwill roll down to the next 3 athletes in line, so that at every Major 3 athletes \nwill qualify for the ELITE 15 race at WORLDS. If an athlete finishes in the \nTop 3 but was already auto qualified, the slot will roll down to the next \nathlete of that respective major.\n7.2 The HYROX World Championships\nThe only route of qualification to the World Championships is via placing \nat a Major Championship or Last Chance Qualifier event.  There is no \ndirect qualification to the World Championships based on a finishing time \nin a regular season race.\n7.3 Qualification by Last Chance Qualifier (LCQ)\nThe three remaining spots after the Majors will go to the top finishers in \nthe pro division of the respective LCQ event. This will be a regular (pro) \nraced. If an athlete drops out or can't attend the Elite 15 Race at Worlds, \nroll downs will apply to the next LCQ athlete in line.\nHYROX EN Doubles Rulebook R2 Season 2024/25\n 10\n  RULEBOOK DOUBLES_\n\n8. THE COMPETITION\n8.1 HYROX DOUBLES Competition\nHYROX DOUBLES is a 2-person-team competition. The DOUBLES Team \ncan consist of 2 male athletes, 2 female athletes or  as MIXED 1 female \nand 1 male athlete.  The competitions consists of a 1 km run followed by \none workout, repeated 8 times. In order to complete the entire HYROX \nDOUBLES Race and receive a valid finishing time, the participants must \ncomplete the runs and workouts in the designated order (run, workout, \nrun, workout, etc) until they have completed a total of 8 k running and 8 \nworkouts. \nWhile the running distance of 8 x 1 km must be completed by both \nDOUBLES Members, the workouts can be completed in a combined \neffort. \n8.2 Workout Stations\nThe 8 workouts must be completed together. However, it is up to each \nDOUBLES Team Member (DTM) how far in distance or how many reps he/ \nshe completes. The HYROX DOUBLES competition follows the principle \n\u201eYGIG\u201c (YOU GO I GO) which means, DTM 1 works, while DTM 2 rest and \nvice versa. Therefore only one of the DTM\u2019s is allowed to be active. Rest \ntimes, can be taken as needed - concurrently as well. \nThe workout station is completed when the entire distance or repetitions \nare covered. \nYGIG Example 1000m Row: \nDTM 1 starts rowing while DTM 2 waits. \nAfter a self-selected distance (for example 250m) DTM 1 stops rowing and \nDTM 2 continues to row. Now DTM 1 rests, and so on. \nThis process is repeated until the entire distance of 1000m is covered. \nHYROX EN Doubles Rulebook R2 Season 2024/25\n 11\n  RULEBOOK DOUBLES_\n\n8.3 Running\nThe DTMs must run together at all times for the entire distance of 1000 m \nbetween the workout-stations. If one DTM runs at a significant faster pace, \nthis will lead to 3 Minute penalty as this disturbs the time tracking system. \nImportant: Once the running distance is completed both DTM\u2019s must \nenter the workout station together. Both DTM\u2019s have to be present in \norder to start with the exercises. The workout station can only be exited \nafter the entire distance or the repetitions are covered, and must be exited \nby both DTM\u2019s at the same time. \nThe running distance is always 1,000 m, and depending on the venue it \nthis will be split into 2-4 running laps. In some cases the first/last running \nlap may not be exactly 1,000 m due to a staggered start. In this case, the \nmissing metres will be balanced out during the last lap.On the run course \nthere is a line dividing the running course into two speed zones: fast lane, \nand regular speed. Faster athletes should run in the fast lane and slower \nathletes in the regular speed lane.\n8.4 Workout Rules and Regulations\n\u2022\nComplete all workouts, in the correct order.\n\u2022\nPerform each exercise according to the movement standards.\n\u2022\nUse the correct start and finish points of the workout-station.\n\u2022\nComplete the correct number of repetitions and/or distances.\n\u2022\nPerform the exercises/movements with the correct weight in kilogram.\n8.5 Referees and Head Judges\nFor each workout a referee will be responsible for ensuring all participants\ncomplete the workout in the correct and safe manner. The referee does \nthis in coordination with the head judge of the respective workout station. \nThe head judge of each workout station is managed by the race director, \nwho oversees all sporting aspects of the competition and makes the final \ndecisions on all judging matters.\nAll decisions of the Race Director and event organisers are final.\nHYROX EN Doubles Rulebook R2 Season 2024/25\n 12\n  RULEBOOK DOUBLES_\n\n9.

PENALTIES\n13.1 Time Penalties \n \n13.1.1 Missing Run Laps\nIf a participant does not run the correct number of laps a time penalty of \n3-7 minutes per lap  will be applied and added to their final result time.\n1\nFor example: For a specific venue the time penalty could be 5 minutes. \nThe participant\u2019s final result time is 1:24 but if they  missed 2 run laps \nthroughout the competition their final result time will be 1:34 (2 x 5 min \npenalties).\n13.1.2 Completing the Workout Stations in the Incorrect Order\nIf a participant does not complete the workout station in the correct \nsequence (1-8), they are permitted to complete missing workout station \nprior to entering station 8 (Wall Balls).  Completing the workout in the \nincorrect order will result in a 3 minute penalty. If more than one workout \nis completed out of order, the participant will automatically be \ndisqualified.\n13.1.3 Missed Workout / Missed 1k Run\nMissing an entire workout station or 1K run will lead to a disqualification.\n \n13.1.4 Confusion of Roxzone IN and OUT\nEach time a participant runs into the Roxzone via the OUT arch, or out of \nthe Roxzone via the IN arch they will receive a 2 minute penalty. \n13.2 Distance/Time Penalties\nDistance/Time penalties can be issued on the run and at Workout Stations \n1-8. Distance penalties depend on the workout and range between 5 \nmeters (for Individual Starters and 10 meters (for Doubles). Time penalties \ndepend on the infringement and Workout Station. \n The number of running laps that add up to 1 km, vary from venue to venue\n1\nHYROX EN Doubles Rulebook R2 Season 2024/25\n 26\n  RULEBOOK DOUBLES_\n\nPenalty decisions can be made by any referee/judge after consensus with \na Head Judge and/or a Race Director.  For Workout Stations 1-7 there will \nbe one warning per station before penalties apply where movement \nstandards are not met. With the second warning (of any infringement), the \nrepetition is considered invalid and the athlete receives the \ncorresponding distance/time penalty. Any further warning within the \nstation will result in additional distance/time penalties. Some time \npenalties can be issued without a warning and will be based upon the \nviolation.\n13.3 Did Not Finish\nIf a participant does not finish a workout station they will not receive any \nresults data and will be excluded from all rankings and awards. However, \nthey may continue with the race (without a final result time).\n13.4 Disqualification\nIf a participant has been disqualified by a Head Judge they will not \nreceive any results data and will be excluded from all rankings and \nawards. Once disqualified by a Head Judge the participant may not \ncontinue the race.\n13.5 Deviations from the Movement Standards\nAny execution of a movement that either deviates from the movement \nstandards, and/or is unusual or uncommon and/or results in a time \nadvantage will not be recognised and will result in an invalid repetition \n(no rep) or a time/distance penalty depending on the workout station.\nHYROX EN Doubles Rulebook R2 Season 2024/25\n 27\n  RULEBOOK DOUBLES_\n\n14.

          "snippet": "HYROX races always take place indoors in large exhibition halls. The running usually takes place on the outside of the hall, while all the exercises are placed inside of the running track.\n\nYou\u2019ll run 1km, head in to complete your first workout station, then head back out on your next 1km run. You repeat this 8 times.\n\nLet\u2019s discuss the station order, race format, layout, and explain the distance and rep requirements for each HYROX station.\n\n\u2026\n\nHere\u2019s an example HYROX race layout from the North American Championships in Washington, DC, USA in March 2025.\n\n**The yellow striped rectangle on the far right**is where spectators cross into the viewing area **The black with yellow striped area**is open to spectators to watch the action\n\nThe HYROX race format will always contain the following:\n\n- The HYROX start tunnel\n\n- A running track around the outside of the venue\n\n- Workout stations situated inside of the running track\n\n- Some additional space inside the running track, before you reach each workout station (aka: the Roxzone)\n\n- Finish line\n\n\u2026\n\n### Running Track\n\nDue to venue differences, the HYROX running track is different at each event. In general, it will resemble an oval shape, and run around the outside edge of the venue.\n\n- Some running tracks are about 300m in length, requiring 3 laps to complete 1km\n\n- Some are closer to 250m in length, requiring 4 laps to complete 1km\n\n- A few might be around 500m in length, requiring only 2 laps to complete 1km\nPlease reference your specific HYROX race map to see how many laps you need to complete.\n\nThe running track contains two lanes\u2014a fast lane and a regular lane. Try to stay in the regular lane, unless you are passing someone. As each new wave of athletes is released, they will likely take off in the fast lane, so be aware of your surroundings.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve completed your 1km run around the track\u2026\n\n### In & Out Arches\n\nThe in & out arches are an important component to understanding the HYROX race format. These are the openings in the running track where you will enter and exit the running track to go in and out of the Roxzone, where all the workout stations are found.\n\nThey are usually located on the same side of the running track, but sometimes the in arch will be closer to the start line, and sometimes the out arch is closer. It just depends on your venue.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Finish Line\n\nYou\u2019ll complete this process 8 times, and finish with the final station, wall balls. There is no run after the wall balls\u2014you run up the ramp to the finish line, where you can look for your name & finishing time on the giant screen.\n\nAnd that is the HYROX layout, in a nutshell.",

CONCEPT\nHYROX, an indoor mass participation fitness competition, is based on an idea by co-founder \nChristian Toetzke and involves a combination of running and functional movements. The race \nwas designed by Mintra Tilly, who also wrote the rulebook.\nHYROX consists of a 1 km run followed by one, repeated 8 times. In order to complete the \nentire HYROX race and receive a valid finishing time, the racers must complete the runs and s \nin the specific order (run, run, etc.) until they have completed a total of 8 km running and 8 s. \nWhilst the repetition range and/or weights differ between the divisions, the running distance \nremains the same across all divisions: each participant must run 1 km before each, i.e. a total \ndistance of 8 km.\nThe results and ranking system are based on the fastest time in each respective division. \nResults are sorted from the fastest to the slowest time. In addition to the overall fastest men\u2019s \nand women\u2019s times, results are also ranked in age groups (see below), also sorted from the \nfastest to the slowest time.\n\nRULEBOOK SINGLE_\nHYROX EN Single Rulebook R1 Season 2025/26\n5\n2.CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION\n2.1 Conditions of participation in HYROX\nHYROX is a race open to everyone, qualifications are not required. \nBy participating in HYROX you are agreeing to the following conditions, which include\nthe exclusion of liability and the terms of the Privacy Policy which can be read at\nhttps://hyrox.com/terms-and-conditions/.\n2.2 Preconditions for participation\n \u2022\nIn order to participate in a HYROX event, \nracers must be at least 16 years old on \nthe day of race.\n \u2022\nOfficial rankings will be based on racers\u2019 \nbiological gender at birth.

The divisions differ in gender, repetition and/or weight. The \nrunning distance remains the same across all divisions: everyone must run 1 km between each \nfor a total distance of 8 km. Racers start in waves based on their division. The start always takes \nplace exclusively with racers of the same division.\n \n4.2 HYROX age groups (excluding PRO Divisions*)\na. Under 24 (16 - 24) \nb. 25 - 29 \nc. 30 - 34 \nd. 35 - 39 \ne. 40 - 44 \nf. 45 - 49 \ng. 50 - 54 \nh. 55 - 59 \ni. 60 - 64 \nj. 65 - 69\nk. 70 - 74* \nl. 75 - 79*\nm. 80 - 84*\nn. 85 - 89*\n*Pro Divisions end at Age Group (h) 70-74\nAge groupers aged 70+ are not eligible to race in the Pro divisions and will not receive an \nofficial ranking, flag, or a World Championship slot.\nA racer\u2018s age group (AG) is determined by their age on the day of race. For example, if the \nracer is turning 40 at their next birthday in November 2025 but they are competing in an event \nin April of 2025, they will compete in age group (d).\n\nRULEBOOK SINGLE_\nHYROX EN Single Rulebook R1 Season 2025/26\n9\n4.3 Ranking System\nThe ranking system and the resulting overall ranking is based on the fastest time in the \nrespective division of each event. Results are sorted from the fastest to the slowest times. In \naddition, there is a ranking within the age groups, also sorted from the fastest to the slowest \ntimes.\nIf a racer competes twice within the same division, only their fastest time will be considered \nfor ranking purposes, and they are not eligible to podium more than once in that division for \nthe same race.\nThe results will be published immediately after each event ends, and will be available at \nresults.hyrox.com. \nAny incomplete running laps or deviation from the prescribed repetition range or movement \nstandards will result in a penalty (see Penalties) and/or disqualification. Penalties may be \nadded or amendments made for up to 48 hours after each event ends.\n\nRULEBOOK SINGLE_\nHYROX EN Single Rulebook R1 Season 2025/26\n10\n5. WORLDS AND ELITE 15\n5.1 Qualification for the HYROX WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS\nThe highlight of every HYROX season are the WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS (hereafter referred \nto as WORLDS). Any HYROX racer starting at a regular HYROX event can qualify for the annual \nHYROX WORLDS. \nThe qualification slots are limited to a specific number for each division at an event. The number \nof qualification slots per division will be announced on the event page of each event city. \nIf a racer is placed within their age group and earns a designated slot, they will be notified via \nemail shortly after the event.\nThe racer will receive an official email with an invitation to register for the WORLDS within a \nstated time frame, otherwise their slot will roll down to the next best placed finisher in that \nsame division. The successful racer will compete at the WORLDS in the age group that they \nqualified in, regardless of their birthday.\n5.2 Qualification as an Individual Starter\nAll racers who have qualified in the age groups (a) - (j) as an individual/single (HYROX MEN / \nHYROX WOMEN / HYROX MEN PRO / HYROX WOMEN PRO) have to complete the distances, \nreps and weights of the PRO division at the championships. For all other single racers who \nqualified in the AG 70+ (k) - (n), the weights, reps and distances remain unchanged.\n5.3 Qualification as a DOUBLES Team\n5.3.1 DOUBLES MEN/WOMEN and DOUBLES MEN/WOMEN PRO\nAll racers who have qualified in the DOUBLES AG (a) - (j) (HYROX DOUBLES MEN / HYROX \nDOUBLES WOMEN / HYROX DOUBLES MEN PRO / HYROX DOUBLES WOMEN PRO) have to \ncomplete the distances, reps and weights of the PRO division at the championships.

The only requirement is that \nthe new DOUBLES team member has to be the same gender and age as the previous member. \nThis way the age group and the division will remain the same.\n5.4 What if a racer qualifies for more than one Division?\nRacers who have qualified for multiple divisions at the WORLDS are permitted to compete \nin multiple divisions as long as their allocated start times do not conflict. Requests to change \nstart times will not be considered. Registering for multiple divisions is at a racer\u2019s own risk \nand refunds are not available in the event that conflicting start times prevent a racer from \nparticipating in multiple divisions.\n5.5 Age Groups \nAll racers will start within their division and AG to determine the AG Winner - AG WORLD \nCHAMPION. The AG is set by the racer\u2019s age at the qualifying event. AG Winners do not qualify \nfor prize money or the overall winners title - World Champion of Fitness Racing.\n5.6 Elite 15 and Prize Money\nThe Elite 15 is a separate start wave that consists of the fastest 15 racers of the Pro division \n(WOMEN PRO and MEN PRO) of the current season leading up to the WORLDS. \nTo learn more, you can read the ELITE 15 Qualification System below.\nOnly racers within the Elite 15 Wave have the opportunity to become the overall world \nchampion - World Champion of Fitness Racing - and win prize money. The prize money \navailable at each World Championship will be announced in the respective Elite 15 Guide. \nElite 15 racers are excluded from the individual AG rankings at the WORLDS and are therefore \nnot eligible to become AG Winner in any of the Individual divisions.\nHYROX reserves the right to hand out Wildcards and invite other racers to the WORLDS at its \ndiscretion. In addition, HYROX reserves the right to make changes to the design of the race \ncourse and Roxzone e.g. to improve spectator viewing or broadcast opportunities.\n\nRULEBOOK SINGLE_\nHYROX EN Single Rulebook R1 Season 2025/26\n12\n6.

Warsaw\n\u2022 Three Regional Championship Races\n1. Washington DC \n(Americas)\n2. London (EMEA)\n3. Brisbane (APAC)\n7.1 Majors\nEach Elite 15 race at a Major will include the fastest 15 female and 15 male qualified racers. \nQualification to the Major events occurs via a combination of automatic qualification through \nplacing in previous season Elite 15 events and/or time based qualification in Pro races.  \n7.1.1 Racers who are automatically qualified (for all four season 24/25 Majors)\n \u2022\nEvery Major Winner of Season 24/25 - \nno roll downs\n \u2022\nSeason 24/25 WORLDS Podiums 1, 2 \nand 3 - roll downs until Podium 5 if a \nMajor winner is amongst the Top 3.\n7.1.2 Qualification by time\nThe time qualification is calculated as the average of the two fastest verified individual Pro \nDivision race times achieved by any athlete within the past 365 days. \nThis 365-day window is a rolling period, meaning it updates daily. At midnight (GMT) on each \nnew day, the earliest day in the previous 365-day period \u2018expires\u2019 and any new results from \nthat day become eligible for consideration. \nThis is a dynamic ranking that will be updated with each race to always reflect the past 365 \ndays from that particular date. Times achieved in Major races and WORLDS will be included \nin this ranking.\n\nRULEBOOK SINGLE_\nHYROX EN Single Rulebook R1 Season 2025/26\n15\n7.1.3 Qualification via Major races \nThe winner of each Major earns an auto qualification slot for the remaining Majors of the \ncurrent as well as the upcoming season - no roll downs.\nPodium place 1, 2 and 3 of each Major event directly qualify the racer for the Elite 15 race at \nWORLDS - if these racers have already qualified, the slot will roll down to the next 3 racers \nin line, so that at every Major, 3 female and 3 male racers will qualify for the ELITE 15 race at \nWORLDS. If a racer finishes in the Top 3 but was already automatically qualified, the slot will \nroll down to the next racer of that respective major.\n7.2 Qualification via Regional Championship Races\nOnly individuals who are citizens or legal permanent residents of a designated country within \neach region are eligible to participate. This excludes temporary visa holders such as tourists, \nstudents, or other non-resident classifications (commonly referred to as legal aliens). \nProof of eligibility must be provided through an original government-issued ID - such as a \npassport or permanent residency card. Driver\u2019s licenses or photocopies of any documents will \nnot be accepted.\nRacers who hold dual or multiple citizenships are only eligible to qualify in one Regional \nChampionship; if they participate in more than one Regional Championship, only the time \nfrom their first race will be considered for qualification purposes.\nThe racer who achieves Podium place 1 of each Regional Championship becomes directly \nqualified for the Elite 15 race at WORLDS - if these racers have already qualified, the slot will \nroll down to the next racer in line, so that at every Regional Championship, 1 female and 1 \nmale racer will qualify for the ELITE 15 race at WORLDS. \n7.3 The HYROX WORLDS\nThe only way to qualify for the WORLDS is by placing at a Major or Regional Championship. \nThere is no direct qualification to the WORLDS based on a finishing time in a regular season \nrace.\n\nRULEBOOK SINGLE_\nHYROX EN Single Rulebook R1 Season 2025/26\n16\n8.

The racer\u2019s final result \ntime is 1:24 but if they missed 2 run laps throughout the race their final result time will be 1:34 \n(2 x 5 minute penalties).\n13.1.2 Completing the Stations in the Incorrect Order\nIf a racer does not complete the station in the correct sequence (1-8), they are permitted to \ncomplete missing stations prior to entering station 8 (Wall Balls). \nCompleting the s in the incorrect order will result in a 3-minute penalty. If more than one is \ncompleted out of order, the participant will automatically be disqualified.\n13.1.3 Missed / Missed 1k Run\nMissing an entire station or 1K run will lead to a disqualification.\n13.1.4 Confusion of Roxzone IN and OUT\nEach time a racer runs into the Roxzone via the OUT arch, or out of the Roxzone via the IN arch \nthey will receive a 2-minute penalty.\n\nRULEBOOK SINGLE_\nHYROX EN Single Rulebook R1 Season 2025/26\n34\n13.2 Time Penalties\nTime penalties can be issued on the run and at Stations 1-8. Time penalties depend on the \ninfringement and Station. \nMany penalties are automatically detected by the timing system using chip reads \u2014 for example, \nincorrect use of the IN/OUT arches or missing sled laps.\nInfractions related to movement standards or rep counts \u2014 such as using the wrong weights, \nfailing to return kettlebells correctly, or a no-rep on wall ball squats \u2014 can be penalised in real \ntime by Judges or Head Judges.\nOnly Race Directors have the authority to disqualify (DQ) a racer, based on input from Head \nJudges, Judges, or their own direct observations.\nFor Stations 1\u20137, racers will receive one warning per station for not meeting movement \nstandards. On the second infringement - regardless of type - the repetition is deemed invalid \nand the racer will receive the associated time or distance penalty. Any further violations within \nthe same station will incur additional penalties. \nNote: Certain violations may result in immediate penalties without warning, depending on \ntheir severity.\n13.3 Did Not Finish\nIf a participant does not finish a station they will not receive any results data and will be \nexcluded from all rankings and awards. However, they may continue with the race (without a \nfinal time).\n13.4 Disqualification\nIf a participant has been disqualified by a Race Director during a race, they will not receive \nany results data from that race and will be excluded from all rankings and awards related to it. \nOnce disqualified, the participant may not continue competing in that specific race.\n13.5 Deviations from the Movement Standards\nAny execution of a movement that either deviates from the movement standards, and/or is \nunusual or uncommon and/or results in a time advantage will not be recognised and will \nresult in an invalid repetition (no rep) or a time penalty.\n\nRULEBOOK SINGLE_\nHYROX EN Single Rulebook R1 Season 2025/26\n35\n14. RULES OF CONDUCT\n\nBy registering for a HYROX event, racers are agreeing to compete in a fair and honorable \nmanner and to abide by the HYROX Code of Conduct, which upholds the core values that \nensure a respectful and inclusive race environment for all. \nPoor sportsmanship e.g., attempts at deception, manipulation, excessive disputes as well \nas disrupting and/or obstructing other participants can lead to penalties, disqualification, a \nlifetime ban from HYROX races and/or legal action. \nAny participant who is disqualified from a HYROX race or banned from future events will not \nreceive a refund for any fees or dues. This also applies to behavior that could harm or disturb \nparticipants, volunteers, staff, sponsors and spectators. Any of the aforementioned actions \nmay be taken against any participant at the discretion of event organisers.",

Your 5K PR won't directly predict your HYROX time. The strength stations level the playing field between runners and strength athletes.\n\n### Common Athlete Profiles\n\n**The Runner**\n\n- 5K: 18-20 min\n\n- Strength training: Minimal\n\n- Expected HYROX: 1:30-1:40 (men), 1:50-2:00 (women)\n\n**Bottleneck:**Sled push (152kg/102kg), sled pull, wall balls\n\n**The CrossFitter**\n\n- 5K: 22-24 min\n\n- CrossFit: 3+ years\n\n- Expected HYROX: 1:25-1:35 (men), 1:40-1:50 (women)\n\n**Bottleneck:**Running endurance, pacing the 8km\n\n**The Balanced Athlete**\n\n- 5K: 20-22 min\n\n- Strength training: 2-3x/week\n\n- Expected HYROX: 1:20-1:30 (men), 1:35-1:45 (women)\n\n**Advantage:**No major weaknesses\n\nPure runners often overestimate their HYROX performance by 10-15 minutes, while CrossFitters underestimate theirs by 5-10 minutes. Train both equally for best results.\n\n## What Makes an Elite HYROX Time?\n\nBreaking into elite territory (\n\n**sub-1:15 men**, **sub-1:24 women**) requires four key elements:\n\n### Sub-5:00/km Running Pace\n\nElite athletes average\n\n**4:30-4:50/km** across all 8km of running, even when fatigued from stations.\n\n### Station Efficiency\n\n|Station|Elite Time (Men)|Elite Time (Women)|\n|--|--|--|\n|SkiErg (1000m)|3:50-4:20|4:30-5:00|\n|Sled Push (152kg/102kg)|2:50-3:26|2:50-3:25|\n|Sled Pull (103kg/78kg)|3:50-4:37|4:15-4:59|\n|Burpee Broad Jumps|4:00-4:37|5:15-5:57|\n|Row (1000m)|4:00-4:33|4:45-5:11|\n|Farmers Carry (48kg/32kg)|1:45-1:59|2:00-2:15|\n|Lunges (20kg/10kg)|3:50-4:24|4:00-4:30|\n|Wall Balls (100 reps)|5:30-6:04|5:20-5:53|\nOne bad station can cost you 5-10 minutes. Elite athletes have NO stations slower than 80th percentile\u2014they're well-rounded, not specialists.\n\n### Minimal RoxZone Time\n\nElite athletes average 4-5 minutes total RoxZone time. Intermediate athletes average 7-8.5 minutes, while beginners may take 9-12 minutes or more.\n\n**RoxZone includes:**\n\n- Running from finish line to station\n\n- Running from station to next start line\n\n- Brief mental prep and equipment setup\n\n### Mental Toughness\n\nThe ability to maintain pace when everything hurts. Elite athletes don't slow down\u2014they manage discomfort better.\n\n## How to Improve Your HYROX Time\n\nBased on your current level:\n\n### Beginners (1:40-2:10)\n\n**Focus:** Finish strong, build base fitness\n\n**Training priorities:**\n\n- Run 3-4x per week at conversational pace\n\n- Practice all 8 stations 1x per week\n\n- Focus on technique before speed\n\nDon't worry about speed yet. Learn proper form on all stations\u2014especially sled push/pull technique with the heavy weights (152kg/103kg for men, 102kg/78kg for women).\u2705\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf Ready to train smarter?** Our 12-Week HYROX Training Program takes you from beginner to race-ready with structured workouts, station technique guides, and proven pacing strategies. Just **$29.99** \u2014 less than a single PT session. Start training smart today.\n\n### Intermediate (1:25-1:40 / 1:37-1:54)\n\n**Focus:** Identify weak stations, improve pacing\n\n**Training priorities:**\n\n- Track your split times\u2014find your slowest 2 stations using our race analyzer tool\n\n- Add 1-2 specific station workouts per week\n\n- Practice negative splitting (running faster as race progresses)\n\n- Use our pacing calculator to set realistic split targets\n\n**Example weakness work:**\n\n- Slow at sled push? Add 2x/week heavy sled work\n\n- Slow at wall balls? Practice 100-rep sets 2x/week\n\n### Advanced (1:15-1:25 / 1:24-1:37)\n\n**Focus:** Fine-tune pacing, maximize efficiency\n\n**Training priorities:**\n\n- Interval training 2x per week (tempo runs, VO2 max)\n\n- Station-specific drills 2-3x per week at race weight\n\n- Practice race-pace RoxZone transitions (sprint between stations)\n\n- Mental toughness training (running under fatigue)\n\n- Analyze your performance data with our race analyzer tool\n\n**Want to break through to the next level?** Our structured 12-week program includes progressive periodization, race simulation protocols, and advanced pacing strategies designed to take intermediate athletes to sub-1:20 performance.\n\n### Elite (under 1:15 / 1:24)\n\n**Focus:** Marginal gains, competition strategy\n\n**Training priorities:**\n\n- Periodized training blocks (build, peak, taper)\n\n- Race simulation workouts every 2-3 weeks\n\n- Video analysis of technique on all stations\n\n- Strategic pacing per course (elevation, heat, competition)\n\n## Realistic Time Improvement Expectations\ud83d\udca1\n\nMost athletes improve 15-25% from their first to second race simply by understanding pacing, knowing the stations, and better race-day nutrition.\n\n**First year:** 15-25% improvement\n\n**Year 2-3:** 5-10% annual improvement with consistent training\n\n**Plateau:** Most athletes plateau after 3-5 years unless they significantly change training\n\n### Example Progression (Male, 30-34):\n\n**First race:**1:55:00 (beginner) **6 months later:**1:40:00 (intermediate) \u2192 13% improvement **1 year later:**1:25:00 (advanced) \u2192 15% improvement **2 years later:**1:15:00 (elite) \u2192 12% improvement **3+ years:**1:10-1:14 (peak elite performance)\n\n## Station Benchmarks: Where Are You Losing Time?\n\nHere's what \"good\" looks like for each station (Men / Women, Intermediate level):\n\n|Station|Intermediate (M/W)|Advanced (M/W)|\n|--|--|--|\n|SkiErg|4:27 / 5:11|4:20 / 5:00|\n|Sled Push|3:41 / 3:42|3:26 / 3:25|\n|Sled Pull|5:06 / 5:34|4:37 / 4:59|\n|Burpee Broad Jumps|5:19 / 6:50|4:37 / 5:57|\n|Row|4:44 / 5:24|4:33 / 5:11|\n|Farmers Carry|2:10 / 2:25|1:59 / 2:15|\n|Lunges|4:56 / 5:01|4:24 / 4:30|\n|Wall Balls|7:01 / 6:51|6:04 / 5:53|\nIf any of your stations are slower than the \"Intermediate\" column, that's your biggest opportunity for improvement. Focus 50% of your training on your weakest 2 stations.\n\n## Your Next Steps\n\nNow that you know where you stand:\n\n**Log your last race splits**\u2014 Find your weak stations **Set a realistic goal**\u2014 Aim for 1 category improvement (Beginner \u2192 Intermediate) **Train specifically**\u2014 Dedicate 2x per week to your weakest station **Track progress**\u2014 Retest stations every 4-6 weeks\n\n#### Key Takeaway\n\nA \"good\" HYROX time is relative to your age, gender, and training background. Focus on improving YOUR time, not comparing yourself to elites. Every PR is worth celebrating.\n\n## FAQs\n\n**Q: What's the average HYROX finish time?**\n\nA: Men average around 1:40:00, women average around 1:54:00 across all age groups and divisions. The median (50th percentile) is slightly faster at 1:33-1:38 for men and 1:47-1:52 for women.\n\n**Q: Is sub 1:30 good for a first race?**\n\nA: Absolutely! Sub 1:30 for men puts you in the advanced category (top 30%). For women, sub 1:45 is also advanced level.\n\n**Q: How long does it take to go from beginner to elite?**\n\nA: Most athletes need 3-5 years of consistent, structured training. Expect 10-20% annual improvement in your first 2 years.\n\n**Q: Do pros use different weights?**\n\nA: No. Pro and Open athletes use the same weights (152kg sled push for men, 102kg for women). Only age group 60+ uses modified weights.\n\n**Q: Why are the sleds so heavy?**\n\nA: HYROX uses 152kg (men) and 102kg (women) for sled push to test strength-endurance. The heavy sleds separate pure runners from hybrid athletes.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions About HYROX Times\n\n### What is a good HYROX time for beginners?\n\nFor beginners, a good HYROX time is 1:40-1:54 for men and 1:54-2:10 for women. If you finish your first race in this range, you're performing better than about 50% of HYROX athletes. Focus on completing the race and building a baseline\u2014you can improve your times with targeted training.\n\n### What is the average HYROX time?\n\nThe average HYROX time for men is approximately 1:35, while women average around 1:50. However, this varies significantly by age group, with younger athletes (25-35) typically finishing 5-10 minutes faster than those in the 45-55 age bracket.\n\n### What HYROX time is considered elite?\n\nElite HYROX times are under 1:15 for men and under 1:26 for women. These times put you in the top 10% of all HYROX finishers globally and typically require years of focused training in both running and functional fitness.\n\n### How do HYROX times vary by age?\n\nHYROX times typically slow by 2-3 minutes per decade after age 35. A 1:30 time for a 25-year-old male would be equivalent to approximately 1:37 for a 45-year-old athlete with similar training. Our age group analysis shows detailed breakdowns by age bracket.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYour best time is one you're proud of. Whether you're chasing a PR, trying to beat a friend, or just finishing your first race\u2014every HYROX time represents hours of hard work.\n\nUse these benchmarks to set realistic goals and train smarter, not to judge your worth as an athlete.\n\n**Related Articles:**\n\n- Age Group Performance Analysis \u2014 Detailed age breakdown\n\n- Average Split Times by Age Group \u2014 Realistic benchmarks\n\n- First HYROX Race Guide \u2014 Complete beginner guide\n\n- How to Beat 1:30 \u2014 Complete training requirements\n\n",

Thursday the 4th of December. I'm racing tomorrow. It's going to be a big one.\n{ts:18} So, in this video, I'm going to go into exactly what Hy Rocks London Excel is all about.\nI'm going to tell you what my\n{ts:23} goals are for this competition, and hopefully that'll give you a little taste of what's to come.\n{ts:32} This will be the first time that the UK has ever had a single lap uh competition as well.\n{ts:41} Doors closing.\nSo, look at this course. Absolutely crazy. One lap. The water stations are\n{ts:52} along the course as well. You can see between the out and the in. And everything's in order for what I believe\n{ts:58} the first time ever. The start tunnel, the Red Bull start tunnel is just in that sort of top kind of left area and\n{ts:66} come out of there. Follow it all the way around past the in and straight into the skir. You pop out,\n{ts:74} do a full back, go to the out, full lap around into the sled push, out of the sled push, and carrying on. So every\n{ts:81} time you're in that area between the in and the out where these stations are, except for the wall balls, you're always\n{ts:88} covering the same amount of distance because on the first lap, the ski is right there, but then you've got further\n{ts:94} to go out.\nOn the sled push, you've got a little bit further to go as you come in, but then it's a bit shorter to go\n{ts:101} out and all the way up to sandbag lunges where that final but one lap is quite long cuz you go all the way up to the\n{ts:108} sandbag lunges on that lap and then you're immediately into that outgate.\nSo, it's going to be an interesting one.\n{ts:113} I have never done a high rocks like this. I've never done a high rocks where there's only one lap. I can only imagine\n{ts:120} that's going to be an advantage because you have less corners to cover. At first, I think people got excited about\n{ts:127} there being no rock zone. And while that's technically correct, there's still quite a lot of distance to cover\n{ts:133} on the run. So, I'm wondering how much that's going to add on. I would expect it to add on\n{ts:140} maybe an extra 300, 400 m maybe each run.\nSo, while there is no rock zone, the time spent in between\n{ts:151} the runs and the stations will still be kind of the same, I'm guessing. I'm interested to see if anyone competed\n{ts:158} today. This is the end of Thursday. If anyone competed today, I'd be very keen to know in the comments how it went for\n{ts:164} you, how it felt for you, and even more importantly, if you've got any pointers for people who are competing tomorrow,\n{ts:171} Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, which would include me tomorrow, of course. And other than that, it looks like a\n{ts:178} normal playing Jane Hierros.\n\n\u2026\n\nAt that\n{ts:198} point, I couldn't follow along the board that they give you that tells you gives you your name and tells you what you've\n{ts:203} got to do. There's just so many people that it was kind of flicking through that so quickly. Um, this being one of\n{ts:210} the biggest, if not the biggest high rocks so far to date, I could only imagine that that is going\n{ts:218} to get incredibly congested. Um, it's going to be in a massive event center. I went to have a little look at it earlier\n{ts:226} and it it is huge and there's lots of people.\nThe other thing that's going to be interesting is the water stations are\n{ts:232} on track. So you come out of your station. Looks like you cross over the lane\n{ts:240} and that's where there are four water stations by the in by the out and then two in the middle which would make me\n{ts:247} believe that people are going to be crossing over the running lane to get water. So, if you're gunning it\n{ts:257} from the ski urg and people are coming out of the sledpool to go and get some water, I wonder if that'll be\n{ts:262} problematic.\nVery interesting to know. Unless they kind of put it by the station. So, we'll\n{ts:268} see. That's one thing I'm very very keen to know. Other than that, it all looks hunky dory. Um, there is a section here.\n{ts:278} So, it changes on the wall balls.\nIt looks like you again, you do the full lap. You go on, you do a full lap, you\n{ts:286} go in on the in duh, and then you do that whole kind of rock zone section and then come in on number eight there. And\n{ts:296} there's its own little kind of lane into the wall balls and then into the finish.\n\n\u2026\n\nOn the right day, I think we can do it. And\n{ts:367} this course might actually prove the perfect platform to try and get your fastest Hy Rock time.\n{ts:375} That's what I'm hoping for. Because it is an unknown layout, it could go either way. that extra mileage on that run that\n{ts:384} has replaced the rock zone might slow it down. Not sure. It's difficult to know. One thing that will happen is when\n{ts:394} you're running a normal hierox, you have your in and your out. So, there's only one channel that people can run into.\n{ts:401} And people naturally slow down as they go in the in.\nAnd they're slow coming out as well. So, they kind of get\n{ts:406} themselves going and they come out. So there's usually a bit of like you have to wiggle around people, run around\n{ts:412} people, kind of be polite, but kind of barge around and like do what you can.\nNow we have eight sections that people\n{ts:422} will be coming in and out of. People will be slowing down and turning left. People will be kind of gearing up to go\n{ts:428} out and that will happen eight times. So that whole section I think sticking to the far right\n{ts:438} will be the only way to go. What might mess that up is that the it looks like the water stations are on the right. So\n{ts:444} it's going to be a weird one. I think being prepared for that section, keeping your running up if you're going for a\n{ts:451} good time and going somewhere from the middle to the right or just being very aware of that section and learning as\n{ts:459} you go. So, be prepared for your first run. Take a look, try and understand the layout of the course, try and read what\n{ts:467} people are doing and then learn from that as the competition goes on and then pick your spot as you go.",

          "snippet": "## Inside HYROX\u2019s New Turf Era and What It Means for Your Training\n\nI remember the first time I walked onto a HYROX sled lane. That thin strip of carpet, duct taped down at the edges, sticky in some parts, slick in others, instantly gave me the sense that no two races would ever feel the same. And honestly, they didn\u2019t. Anyone who has done more than one HYROX knows that how your sled feels on race day is almost a coin toss. Sometimes it glides. Sometimes it drags like you\u2019re pushing a car stuck in mud.\n\n## Well, that era might finally be over.\n\nHYROX has just introduced a brand new competition surface for their sled stations. It is called the HYROX x Centr Perform Turf and it made its debut at the 2025 World Championships in Chicago. From now on, this is the turf you will be pushing and pulling on, whether you are racing in London, New York, or anywhere else across their global circuit.\n\nThis might sound like a minor tweak. It is not. This is one of the biggest practical changes the sport has made since it began.\n\n\u2026\n\nTo solve this, HYROX has partnered with Centr - yes, the same Centr that was co-founded by Chris Hemsworth and later acquired by HighPost Capital - to develop a modular turf designed specifically for sled work. According to HYROX, they tested over 200,000 sled movements across different materials to get the formula right. They wanted something that felt grippy but not grabby, smooth but still demanding.\nThe result is a custom 16 millimeter turf with a pile height that reduces carpet bunching, maintains durability, and gives a more consistent push across all lanes.\n\nThat all sounds great in theory. But what about in practice?\n\n## Chicago is the Big Reveal\n\nNext week\u2019s World Championships in Chicago will be the first time the new HYROX x Centr Perform Turf is used in an official race. Until now, no regular HYROX event has featured this surface. All previous qualifiers, including New York and London, were still run on the traditional carpet system.\nSo while HYROX has tested the turf behind closed doors - including some trials at private venues - Chicago will be the first time thousands of athletes run, push, and pull on it under full race conditions.\n\nThat means nobody truly knows how it will hold up over a full day of elite and open heats. There is a lot riding on it. HYROX says the turf has been tested for over two hundred thousand sled movements, but competition is a different beast.\n\n\u2026\n\n## What does this mean for training?\n\nIf you are a gym owner, a HYROX coach, or just someone chasing a PB on race day, this new turf matters. HYROX has said that their Performance Centres - the official gyms they partner with - will eventually install the same turf to give members a more authentic race prep. That is huge. It means no more guessing what your sled will feel like on race day. It means fewer nasty surprises at your next event.",

          "snippet": "Here\u2019s an example HYROX race layout from the North American Championships in Washington, DC, USA in March 2025.\n\n**The yellow striped rectangle on the far right**is where spectators cross into the viewing area **The black with yellow striped area**is open to spectators to watch the action\n\nThe HYROX race format will always contain the following:\n\n- The HYROX start tunnel\n\n- A running track around the outside of the venue\n\n- Workout stations situated inside of the running track\n\n- Some additional space inside the running track, before you reach each workout station (aka: the Roxzone)\n\n- Finish line\n\n\u2026\n\nPlease reference your specific HYROX race map to see how many laps you need to complete.\n\nThe running track contains two lanes\u2014a fast lane and a regular lane. Try to stay in the regular lane, unless you are passing someone. As each new wave of athletes is released, they will likely take off in the fast lane, so be aware of your surroundings.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve completed your 1km run around the track\u2026\n\n### In & Out Arches\n\nThe in & out arches are an important component to understanding the HYROX race format. These are the openings in the running track where you will enter and exit the running track to go in and out of the Roxzone, where all the workout stations are found.\n\nThey are usually located on the same side of the running track, but sometimes the in arch will be closer to the start line, and sometimes the out arch is closer. It just depends on your venue.\nYou always enter the Roxzone through the IN arch and exit the Roxzone back onto the running track via the OUT arch. Penalties are assessed for going in or out the wrong arch.\n\n### Roxzone\n\nAs soon as you exit the running track to head to a workout station, you enter what is called the Roxzone. You may walk, jog, or run through the Roxzone to get to the station you need to complete.\n\nThe Roxzone at each race is different, but your split times will include how much time you spent in the Roxzone throughout the race.\nMost hydration stations are found within the Roxzone.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that while you might think a HYROX race consists of 8km of running (8 x 1km laps), HYROX has stated that the running laps combined with the distance in the Roxzone always equals 8.7km total.\n\nYou will run in the Roxzone to find the arch with the name/number of your next station.\n\n### Workout Stations\n\nAt every HYROX, the 8 workout stations are always contained within the inside of the running track. However, they are not always in the same order, or even the order that they are to be completed. It\u2019s your responsibility to remember which station you are on, and find the appropriate arch for that station.\n\nYou\u2019ll enter through the station arch to complete your station work.\n\nUpon finishing your station work, you\u2019ll travel through the Roxzone, but this time you\u2019ll look for the OUT arch to get back onto the running track.\n\n### Finish Line\n\nYou\u2019ll complete this process 8 times, and finish with the final station, wall balls. There is no run after the wall balls\u2014you run up the ramp to the finish line, where you can look for your name & finishing time on the giant screen.\n\nAnd that is the HYROX layout, in a nutshell.\n\n\u2026\n\n#### Spectator Grandstand\n\nYou might also see this referred to as the \u201cHYROX Thunderdome,\u201d but this is essentially a large seating area for spectators to watch the event. It is almost always situated in and around station 8, the wall balls.\n\nAny athlete or spectator may visit this area as often as they\u2019d like throughout the day to watch the action unfold.",

However, being familiar with the movements, what you need to know, transition tips and at gym alternatives is key. The winners are less about maximal fitness and more about pacing discipline, clean mechanics, and Roxzone skill.\n\n\u2026\n\nROXZONE is the clearly marked transition corridor that guides athletes into and out of each workout station. It standardizes flow, keeps athletes in the correct lanes, and gives judges a safe, visible area to brief you and confirm standards. You must enter the appropriate station through the ROXZONE boundaries; skipping or entering the wrong way can result in penalties. Length and layout vary by venue (some are long and curved, others short and direct), so pacing and awareness here matter\u2014your total race time includes all movement through the ROXZONE.\n**Race\u2011day checklist for the ROXZONE**\n\n\u2022 Walk the route during warm\u2011up. Note where each station's entry/exit is and the judge position.\n\n\u2022 Eyes up 20 m out. Read signage early so you don't overshoot the station entrance.\n\n\u2022 Control your breathing.

          "snippet": "Creating the perfect flooring for a high-impact Hyrox training gym requires a unique mix of durability, comfort, and specialised design to support a wide range of activities, from heavy lifting and high-intensity interval training to speed lanes for agility drills.\n\nEach type of flooring in the gym serves a unique function, and understanding these differences can help maximise both performance and safety.\nBelow, we\u2019ll dive deeper into Hyrox, what's involved and how you can create the perfect Hyrox training setup. Whether you're outfitting an existing gym space or looking to support Hyrox training at-home, we'll look at the best hyrox training flooring options that not only optimise safety but elevate your performance.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\nHow Often Are Hyrox Events Held?\n\nTypes of Hyrox Classes and Workouts\n\nWhat Equipment is Used in Hyrox Workout Stations?\n\nWhat Type of Flooring do I need for Hyrox training?\n\n## What is Hyrox?\n\nHyrox is a rapidly growing fitness competition that combines endurance, functional strength, and high-intensity interval training in a unique and challenging format. Originally founded in Germany, Hyrox has gained traction world-wide and is now a popular event series in the UK, attracting everyone from fitness enthusiasts to elite athletes.\n\n\u2026\n\n**Farmers Carry**\u2013 Walking with weights to build grip and core strength.\n\n\n\n**Sandbag Lunges**\u2013 Weighted lunges using a sandbag.\n\n\n\n**Wall Balls**\u2013 Throwing a weighted ball to a target, testing endurance and coordination.\n\nThe event format is the same for each Hyrox race, and competitors can participate individually or in pairs. With multiple categories available, including Men\u2019s, Women\u2019s, Mixed Doubles, and various age divisions, Hyrox events are open to all fitness levels.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Types of Hyrox Classes and Workouts\n\nHyrox gyms offer a variety of classes and hyrox equipment, focused on the event's core components, including:\n\n\n\n**HYROX Endurance**\u2013 Focuses on aerobic conditioning and running stamina.\n\n\n\n**HYROX Strength**\u2013 Emphasizes building the power and strength needed for exercises like the sled push and sandbag lunges.\n**HYROX Technique**\u2013 Helps athletes perfect the specific skills and movements required for each workout station.\n\n\n\n**HYROX Race Simulation**\u2013 A full-length workout that mimics the complete event, allowing participants to prepare for the demands of race day.\n\nClasses can vary in intensity and duration, making them suitable for everyone from beginners to advanced athletes.\n\n\u2026\n\n**Sleds**for pushing and pulling, which build lower body and core strength.\n\n\n\n**Sandbags**for lunges and carries, which help improve functional strength.\n\n\n\n**Farmers Carry weights**(usually kettlebells or dumbbells) for grip strength.\n\n\n\n**Wall Balls**for explosive movements and coordination.\n\n\n\n**Weighted Vests**(used in advanced training) to add resistance and increase workout difficulty.\n\n## What Type of Flooring do I need for Hyrox training?\n\nWith such a wide combination of activities involved in Hyrox training, the gym flooring should be versatile, extra hardwearing and be strong enough to withstand heavy weights and equipment. Let's look at the top flooring options for the various functional workout stations.\n\n**Heavy Duty Rubber Tiles for Weightlifting Zones**\nWhen it comes to the heavy lifting areas of a gym, durability and impact-resistance are paramount. Heavy duty rubber tiles or olympic weightlifting flooring, typically available in thicker formats (20mm to 40mm) are engineered specifically to handle the weight and force of heavy weights, kettlebells, and other lifting equipment.\n**Key Benefits**:\n\n\n\n**Exceptional Durability**: These tiles are built to withstand repeated impact from heavy weights, which makes them ideal for deadlift and powerlifting areas. Likewise, rubber tiles will also protect your equipment from premature wear and tear.\n\n\n\n**Shock Absorption**: The added thickness provides excellent shock absorption, protecting both the subfloor and equipment from damage while also reducing noise and vibration.\n**Anti-Slip Surface**: Rubber tiles generally have a textured, anti-slip surface, which is crucial in a high-intensity environment where safety is paramount.\n\n**Considerations**:\n\n\n\n**Installation**: Thicker rubber tiles are typically available in interlocking styles, which makes installation more straightforward and minimises movement over time.\n**Maintenance**: Rubber tiles are generally easy to clean, but regular maintenance will ensure they stay in peak condition. They\u2019re also water-resistant, which is essential in any area that will see moisture and humidity from perspiration.\n\n**Customer Feedback:**\n\n\"Our gym flooring has made a huge difference to training at home. It feels like a professional gym, is much kinder on your legs and it cancels out noise so well. Very happy with the look and quality of these tiles.\"\n**Ultra-Smooth Self-Locking Rubber Mats for Comfort and Versatility**\n\nFor areas requiring more versatile flooring, ultra-smooth interlocking gym mats are an ideal choice. Interlocking tiles usually come in a 20mm thickness which allows for weight-based activities as well as functional training and conditioning workouts.\n\nWhat makes these tiles a good choice for Hyrox is their versatility, extra stability and comfort. The hidden connection inserts keep the tiles held tightly together so that the surface remains in position even throughout the most intense training sessions.\n**Key Benefits**:\n\n\n\n**Quick and Simple Installation**: Self-locking mats are designed for easy installation, which saves time and eliminates the need for adhesives. Their edges interlock snugly, keeping them securely in place during workouts.\n\n\n\n**Enhanced Comfort**: With a slightly softer surface than heavy-duty tiles, these mats add comfort underfoot, especially for exercises that involve getting down on the floor.\n**Shock Absorption**: While not as thick as heavy-duty rubber tiles, these mats still offer a good level of shock absorption, helping protect users from impact-related injuries.\n\n**Considerations**:\n\n\n\n**Flexibility**: If the gym layout changes frequently, these mats are ideal as they\u2019re easy to uninstall and move around.\n**Cleaning**: Self-locking mats are generally low-maintenance, but their smooth surface makes them easy to wipe down, which is perfect for high-traffic areas.\n\n**Functional Training Turf for Speed Lanes and Agility Tracks**\n\nFunctional training turf, often used in the form of speed lanes, agility tracks or sled tracks are becoming a popular addition in high-impact gyms. Designed specifically for sprinting, sled work, and agility drills, turf provides a versatile surface that complements more intense and dynamic training activities.\n**Key Benefits**:\n\n\n\n**Specialised for Functional Training**: This turf is made to endure high-speed, high-impact movements, making it ideal for speed and agility work that is central to Hyrox training.\n\n\n\n**Durable and Resilient**: Functional training turf is built to last, even under heavy use. The fibres are designed to withstand dragging, pushing, and pulling motions without wearing down.\n**Traction and Stability**: Turf offers excellent traction for users, which helps in preventing slips during quick changes in direction. It also provides a stable surface for sled pushes and other resistance work.\n\n**Considerations**:\n\n\n\n**Customisation**: Speed lanes and agility tracks can be customised with markings, which adds to the aesthetic and functional appeal of the gym.\n**Maintenance**: Regular brushing and cleaning are essential to keep the turf looking fresh and to prevent wear from accumulated dirt and sweat.\n\n**Rubber Rolls for Seamless Cardio Areas**\n\nFor the cardio zones where machines like treadmills, bikes, and rowers are placed, rubber matting roll provides a seamless and protective surface that is ideal for both high and low-impact activities. Rubber roll flooring is a top choice for its resilience and versatility, as it can cover large areas with minimal seams, enhancing both the look and functionality of the gym floor.\n**Key Benefits**:\n\n\n\n**Continuous and Seamless Surface**: Rubber rolls create a smooth, continuous surface without the need for as many seams, reducing the chances of tripping or separation over time.\n\n\n\n**Noise Reduction**: The rubber absorbs sound, helping to muffle the noise from cardio machines, which contributes to a more pleasant gym environment.\n**Protects the Subfloor**: Rubber roll flooring acts as a protective barrier between heavy cardio machines and the subfloor, preventing indentations and scratches from equipment.\n\n**Considerations**:\n\n\n\n**Installation**: Rubber rolls may require professional installation for best results, as they need to be cut to fit the space precisely.\n**Easy Maintenance**: The seamless nature of rubber rolls makes it easy to clean and maintain, ideal for spaces with heavy foot traffic.\n\n**Selecting the Right Flooring Mix for a High-Impact Hyrox Gym**\n\nEach type of flooring in a Hyrox gym plays a unique role in supporting different activities. Here\u2019s a quick summary to help make the right flooring choices:\n**Heavy Duty Rubber Tiles**: Essential for weightlifting areas that experience heavy impacts.\n\n\n\n**Ultra-Smooth Self-Locking Rubber Mats**: Ideal for versatile training zones and quick installation.\n\n\n\n**Functional Training Turf**: Perfect for agility and speed drills, adding a dynamic element to the gym.\n\n\n\n**Rubber Rolls**: Provides a seamless, protective surface for cardio zones, ensuring stability and durability.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy carefully choosing and combining these training floor types you can create the perfect environment for hyrox and meets the demands of these intense workouts, while ensuring longevity, safety, and comfort for gym-goers.\n\nWhether you\u2019re designing a new gym or upgrading an existing space for hyrox classes, the right flooring mix can elevate the overall training experience and support a full range of activities within a single, cohesive space.\n\nDiscover Bestselling gym floor solutions for your Hyrox facility by checking out our fitness flooring collection.",

Starting in the Red Bull tunnel you head out into your first run then into the Roxzone to complete your workout. This is repeated up until the final workout in the Thunder Dome for your 100 wall balls, then takes racers across the finish line.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Navigating the racecourse\n\nFor some, this may seem the most daunting part of the day, but I assure you the race is laid out very clearly and you won't get lost.\n\nRace layouts are sent out with packs and are available online. These will identify the Warm Up area, Start Zone, the IN and OUT from the run to the roxzone into the functional workouts, how the functional workouts are placed (these may not be in numerical order), the location of the hydration stations, the finish line and recovery area.\nI highly recommend viewing this and then arriving on race day early to walk the set-up so you are ready to race.\n\nWhat makes it easier is that you should easily be able to spot large inflatable arches that will mark:\n\n- the IN route for leaving the run course.\n\n- the OUT arch for leaving the roxzone for your next run.\n\n- the station numbers and what they are, so you won't miss a station or confuse the order.\n\nAnd if you're in doubt, there are judges, race directors and volunteers everywhere in the roxzone to help you get to the right place.",

          "snippet": "# Hyrox Astro Turf & Custom Turf Lanes for Gyms in Singapore: Built for Speed, Sled Work & Functional Performance\n\nAs Hyrox continues to grow across Singapore, more gyms are upgrading their functional areas with\n\n**Hyrox astro turf** or **custom turf lanes** built specifically for sled push, sled pull, sprint drills and high-intensity conditioning. Unlike standard green turf used for d\u00e9cor or light fitness activities, Hyrox-grade turf is engineered for **speed, traction, and repeated sled resistance**, making it essential for performance-driven gyms and functional studios.\nAt GymFlooring.sg, we specialise in providing\n\n**custom Hyrox turf lanes** tailored to gym layouts, branding and training requirements \u2014 from standard 10\u201315m lanes to fully customised turf with race markings, arrows, zone labels and gym logos. **Why Hyrox Gyms in Singapore Use Astro Turf Lanes**\nHyrox training involves repeated functional movements at high intensity, which makes the flooring surface extremely important. Hyrox turf offers:\n\n**1. Perfect Glide for Sled Push & Sled Pull Work**\n\nHyrox astro turf provides the\n\n**ideal friction level** for sled work \u2014 smooth enough for consistent pushing, yet resistant enough to build powerful leg drive. **2. Traction for Sprinting & Conditioning**\nThe textured surface gives excellent grip for:\n\nSled push\n\nBurpee broad jumps\n\nRunning starts\n\nPower strides\n\nFunctional conditioning drills\n\n**3. Shock Absorption & Joint Comfort**\n\nA quality turf layer reduces joint impact during:\n\nWalking lunges\n\nBear crawls\n\nHyrox stations that require repeated floor contact\n\nThis makes it safer and more comfortable for athletes training multiple times a week.\n**4. High Visibility & Zone Control**\n\nHyrox gyms frequently use turf to create clear movement zones for:\n\nSled lanes\n\nRelay runs\n\nConditioning tracks\n\nFunctional training circuits\n\nThis improves workout flow and helps coaches manage classes efficiently.\n\n**Custom Turf Options for Hyrox & Functional Gyms**\n\nEvery gym has different space constraints, layouts and branding needs. That\u2019s why we offer customisable turf solutions, including:\n**Custom Lengths & Widths**\n\n10m\n\n12m\n\n15m\n\n20m\n\nFull-room installations\n\nNarrow lanes for compact gyms\n\nDouble-wide lanes for group classes\n\n**Branding & Visual Identity**\n\nCustom turf colours (black, green, grey, blue, red)\n\nPrinted gym logos\n\nSprint arrows\nHyrox-style distance markers\n\nFunctional zone labels (\u201cSLED\u201d, \u201cRUN\u201d, \u201cPOWER\u201d)\n\n**Surface Density & Thickness Options**\n\nDepending on usage intensity, turf can be tailored for:\n\nHeavy sled training\n\nHigh-traffic classes\n\nSpeed and agility drills\n\nStrength & conditioning hybrid sessions\n\n**Edge Finishing & Flooring Integration**\nWe customise:\n\nSlope transitions\n\nTermination strips\n\nSeamless integration with rubber flooring\n\nClean, professional finishing for premium studios\n\nYour turf lane can blend perfectly with\n\n**Armaguard rubber mats**, functional flooring, or full-studio layouts. **Hyrox Turf vs Standard Turf: Why It Matters**\n\nNot all turf is designed for sled work. Hyrox gyms require:\nStrong backing for durability\n\nHigh-density fibres that won\u2019t flatten\n\nCorrect friction for sled movement\n\nResistant stitching for heavy use\n\nStable underlayment to prevent shifting\n\nStandard decorative turf often\n\n**frays, shifts, or wears out quickly** under heavy Hyrox use.\n\nHyrox astro turf, however, is\n**purpose-built** for:\n\nSled pushes\n\nSled pulls\n\nRunning mechanics\n\nPower drills\n\nHigh-intensity circuits\n\nThis makes it ideal for commercial gyms, boutique studios, PT spaces and performance centres.\n\n**Popular Turf Configurations in Singapore Gyms** **1.

The running usually takes place on the outside of the hall, while all the exercises are placed inside of the running track.\n\nYou\u2019ll run 1km, head in to complete your first workout station, then head back out on your next 1km run. You repeat this 8 times.\n\nLet\u2019s discuss the station order, race format, layout, and explain the distance and rep requirements for each HYROX station.\n\n## HYROX Stations\n\nThe 8 HYROX stations, in order, are:\n\n- Ski \u2013 1000m\n\n- Sled Push \u2013 50m\n\n- Sled Pull \u2013 50m\n\n- Burpee Broad Jumps \u2013 80m\n\n- Row \u2013 1000m\n\n- Farmer\u2019s Carry \u2013 200m\n\n- Sandbag Lunges \u2013 100m\n\n- Wall Balls \u2013 100 reps\n\nFor each HYROX division, the distances & reps remain the same (exception: adaptive divisions). However, different weights are used depending on which division you\u2019re competing in. See our guides below \ud83d\udc47\n\n- All HYROX weights, by division & station \u2192\n\n- Learn more about HYROX Doubles and the HYROX Relay\n\n- Simplified version of all the HYROX rules \u2192\n\nNow let\u2019s break down the 8 HYROX stations, sometimes referred to as HYROX exercises.\n\n### 1. 1000m Ski\n\nThe ski is the very first HYROX station, after completing your first 1km run. All HYROX races use a Concept2 SkiErg for the ski.\n\nAll HYROX divisions complete 1000m on the ski before moving on to their second 1km run.\n\nDoubles teams can split up the 1000m ski however they\u2019d like. One person can do all 1000m, you can split it 500m apiece, switch every 100m, etc.\n\n\ud83d\udc47 We break down the ski setup, strategy, and more in our comprehensive guide below.\n\n- Complete guide on the HYROX ski station \u2192 (coming soon)\n\n### 2. 50m Sled Push\n\nAfter completing your second 1km run, you\u2019ll enter the sled push station. All participants must complete 50m of a sled push.\n\nThe 50m is broken up into 12.5m sections. You\u2019ll push down 12.5m. Then push the sled another 12.5m back to its starting position. Repeat this down and back one more time for a total of 50m.\n\nOnce completing the sled push, you\u2019ll head out (usually the opposite way you entered) for your third 1km run.\n\n\ud83d\udc47 We break down the sled push setup, strategy, and more in our guide below.\n\n### 3. 50m Sled Pull\n\nAfter your third run, you\u2019ll enter the sled pull station. The setup looks similar to the sled push, with the same 12.5m sections. Only this time, you use a rope to pull the sled 12.5m, then jog down to the other side, and pull the sled back with a rope attached to the opposite side of the sled.\n\nYou\u2019ll complete a total of 50m of sled pull before heading out for run #4.\n\n\ud83d\udc47 We break down the sled pull setup, strategy, and more in our guide below.\n\n### 4. 80m Burpee Broad Jumps\n\nThe fourth HYROX station is the burpee broad jumps. When you arrive to this station, you start with your hands and feet behind the starting line. You\u2019ll do a burpee, then jump forward. You\u2019ll continue to do a burpee plus a jump, until you have completed all 80m.\n\nEach race might have a slightly different burpee broad jump setup, but most venues have either:\n\n- 80m in one continuous length\n\n- 40m down, 40m back\n\n- a zigzag pattern with ~20m lengths (i.e. down, back, down, back)\n\n\ud83d\udc47 We break down burpee broad jump setup, strategy, and more in our guide below.\n\n- HYROX burpee broad jump guide \u2192 (coming soon)\n\n### 5. 1000m Row\n\nThe 1000m row is the fifth HYROX station. All HYROX races use a Concept2 RowErg for the row station.\n\nAll HYROX divisions complete 1000m on the row before moving on to run #6.\n\nYou\u2019ll enter the row station, go to the row that the judge instructs you to, adjust your damper and foot straps, row 1000m, and then exit the station from the opposite end you entered. You must remain in your seat until your screen shows 1000m.\n\nDoubles teams can split up the 1000m row however they\u2019d like. One person can do all 1000m, you can split it 500m apiece, switch every 100m, etc.\n\n\ud83d\udc47 We break down the row setup, strategy, and more in our comprehensive guide below.\n\n- HYROX row setup, strategy & tips \u2192 (coming soon)\n\n### 6. 200m Farmer\u2019s Carry\n\nThe sixth station in HYROX is the farmer\u2019s carry. Athletes will carry two kettlebells at their sides a total of 200m (see farmer\u2019s carry weights by division). Athletes may walk, jog, or run, but must be carrying both kettlebells at their sides in order to make forward progress.\n\nThe farmer\u2019s carry course differs from race to race, depending on the venue. You might see\u2026\n\n- 2 laps of 50m down and back\n\n- 1 lap of a zigzag course, each down & back at varying lengths\n\n\ud83d\udc47 We break down the farmer\u2019s carry setup, strategy, and more in our comprehensive guide below.\n\n- HYROX farmer\u2019s carry guide \u2192 (coming soon)\n\n### 7. 100m Sandbag Lunges\n\nAfter the farmer\u2019s carry comes the sandbag lunges. You\u2019ll enter the 7th HYROX station, load a sandbag on your back (see lunge weights by division), start behind the starting line, and lunge until you\u2019ve completed 100m.\n\n- You must lunge forward and alternate feet\n\n- You may\n\n**not**shuffle or step your feet between lunges\n\n- Dropping the sandbag will incur a penalty\n\nHYROX lunge courses also vary by venue.\n\n- 50m down and back\n\n- ~25m down and back, in a zigzag format\n\n\ud83d\udc47 We break down the sandbag lunge setup, strategy, and more in our resource below.\n\n- HYROX sandbag lunge strategy guide \u2192 (coming soon)\n\n### 8. 100 Wall Balls\n\nWall balls are the 8th and final HYROX station. Once you\u2019ve completed your 100th wall ball, congratulations \ud83c\udf89. You are now a HYROX finisher!\n\nYou\u2019ll enter the wall ball station after your 8th 1km run. Judges are usually there to direct you to a specific lane. Make sure you pick up the correct weight ball, squat below parallel, and hit the correct target.\n\n\ud83d\udc47 We discuss the wall ball setup, strategy, and more in our guide below.\n\n- HYROX wall ball station guide \u2192 (coming soon)\n\n## HYROX Race Format & Layout\n\nHYROX is a standardized fitness race, with the same movements, same distances, in the same order, every race. However, there are slight variations in the race format, as each race takes place in a different venue. And not all venues allow for an identical setup each time.\n\nHere\u2019s an example HYROX race layout from the North American Championships in Washington, DC, USA in March 2025.\n\n**The yellow striped rectangle on the far right**is where spectators cross into the viewing area **The black with yellow striped area**is open to spectators to watch the action\n\nThe HYROX race format will always contain the following:\n\n- The HYROX start tunnel\n\n- A running track around the outside of the venue\n\n- Workout stations situated inside of the running track\n\n- Some additional space inside the running track, before you reach each workout station (aka: the Roxzone)\n\n- Finish line\n\n### Start Tunnel\n\nThis is one of the most unique & exciting aspects of a HYROX race, especially if it\u2019s your first time. At every event, HYROX builds an inflatable start tunnel where all athletes gather before they start the race.\n\nIt\u2019s a darker, semi-enclosed environment, with lights and a separate speaker system to hype you up before you start. There\u2019s a hype person to give you a pep talk before it\u2019s go time, and a countdown clock counts down the seconds before you take off.\n\n\u26a1\ufe0f I can almost guarantee it\u2019ll be one of the most electric starts to a race you\u2019ve ever experienced.\n\nOnce you take off, you\u2019ll immediately be sent onto the running track\u2026\n\n### Running Track\n\nDue to venue differences, the HYROX running track is different at each event. In general, it will resemble an oval shape, and run around the outside edge of the venue.\n\n- Some running tracks are about 300m in length, requiring 3 laps to complete 1km\n\n- Some are closer to 250m in length, requiring 4 laps to complete 1km\n\n- A few might be around 500m in length, requiring only 2 laps to complete 1km\n\nPlease reference your specific HYROX race map to see how many laps you need to complete.\n\nThe running track contains two lanes\u2014a fast lane and a regular lane. Try to stay in the regular lane, unless you are passing someone. As each new wave of athletes is released, they will likely take off in the fast lane, so be aware of your surroundings.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve completed your 1km run around the track\u2026\n\n### In & Out Arches\n\nThe in & out arches are an important component to understanding the HYROX race format. These are the openings in the running track where you will enter and exit the running track to go in and out of the Roxzone, where all the workout stations are found.\n\nThey are usually located on the same side of the running track, but sometimes the in arch will be closer to the start line, and sometimes the out arch is closer. It just depends on your venue.\n\nYou always enter the Roxzone through the IN arch and exit the Roxzone back onto the running track via the OUT arch. Penalties are assessed for going in or out the wrong arch.\n\n### Roxzone\n\nAs soon as you exit the running track to head to a workout station, you enter what is called the Roxzone. You may walk, jog, or run through the Roxzone to get to the station you need to complete.\n\nThe Roxzone at each race is different, but your split times will include how much time you spent in the Roxzone throughout the race.\n\nMost hydration stations are found within the Roxzone.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that while you might think a HYROX race consists of 8km of running (8 x 1km laps), HYROX has stated that the running laps combined with the distance in the Roxzone always equals 8.7km total.\n\nYou will run in the Roxzone to find the arch with the name/number of your next station.\n\n### Workout Stations\n\nAt every HYROX, the 8 workout stations are always contained within the inside of the running track. However, they are not always in the same order, or even the order that they are to be completed. It\u2019s your responsibility to remember which station you are on, and find the appropriate arch for that station.\n\nYou\u2019ll enter through the station arch to complete your station work.\n\nUpon finishing your station work, you\u2019ll travel through the Roxzone, but this time you\u2019ll look for the OUT arch to get back onto the running track.\n\n### Finish Line\n\nYou\u2019ll complete this process 8 times, and finish with the final station, wall balls. There is no run after the wall balls\u2014you run up the ramp to the finish line, where you can look for your name & finishing time on the giant screen.\n\nAnd that is the HYROX layout, in a nutshell.\n\n### Merch, Sponsors, Spectators, Etc.\n\nOutside of the actual race, you\u2019ll find additional things at every HYROX event:\n\n- Registration\n\n- Bag drop\n\n- Spectator grandstand\n\n- Sponsor booths\n\n- Merchandise area\n\n- Relay exchange zone\n\n- Hydration stations\n\n- Medical station\n\n- Recovery area\n\n- Finish zone\n\n- Ceremony stage\n\nMany of these are self-explanatory, but let\u2019s discuss the ones that affect the actual format of a HYROX race.\n\n#### Spectator Grandstand\n\nYou might also see this referred to as the \u201cHYROX Thunderdome,\u201d but this is essentially a large seating area for spectators to watch the event. It is almost always situated in and around station 8, the wall balls.\n\nAny athlete or spectator may visit this area as often as they\u2019d like throughout the day to watch the action unfold.\n\n#### Hydration Stations\n\nIf you need water or electrolytes during the race, there are one or two stations where you can find replenishment. The hydration stations are usually located inside of the Roxzone, but this varies by venue. Look at your specific race map to see where they are located for your race.\n\n#### Relay Exchange Zone\n\nThe relay exchange zone is only for those competing in the HYROX relay division. This is where your relay partners will be staged as they wait for you to complete your leg. Once you\u2019ve finished your 1km run and subsequent station, you\u2019ll enter the relay exchange zone, locate the athlete on your team assigned to the next leg, and tag them in.\n\n#### Finish Zone\n\nThe finish area is the final part of a HYROX course that you\u2019ll encounter, and it\u2019s an exciting one. All HYROX races finish up a small ramp and on a small stage, backed by a massive screen with finishing times, as well as lights and a DJ.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve completed your 100th wall ball, head up the ramp and between the two pillars to finish your race on the HYROX finishers stage.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to sign up for a race, check out our guide to HYROX tickets, including some important changes for the 2025/26 season.\n\nIf you have any questions about the HYROX stations or race format, please reach out on Instagram (@fitnessexperiment.co).

Both partners must enter and exit each station together.*\n\n*Mixed Doubles wall ball target: Women use 2.70m target, Men use 3.00m target.*\n\n#### Relay Division\nRelay teams (4 people) use **Open division weights**. Each person completes 2 runs + 2 stations. *(Source: hellohyrox.com verified against official relay rulebook description)*\n\n---\n\n### Sled Push vs. Sled Pull: Weight Difference Breakdown\n\n| Division | Sled Push (incl. sled) | Sled Pull (incl. sled) | Difference (Push heavier by) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Open Women | 102 kg | 78 kg | **24 kg** |\n| Pro Women / Open Men | 152 kg | 103 kg | **49 kg** |\n| Pro Men | 202 kg | 153 kg | **49 kg** |\n\n**Why the difference?** The sled pull is lighter because the pulling motion (hand-over-hand rope pulling while standing stationary in a box) is biomechanically more demanding \u2014 it relies primarily on upper body (arms, back, grip) rather than the powerful leg drive available in a sled push. Additionally, the athlete cannot use bodyweight as leverage the way they can when pushing. The lighter weight on the pull compensates for this biomechanical disadvantage.\n\n**Note on sled weight:** The listed weights are **total weight including the sled itself.** The sled body typically weighs approximately 30\u201352 kg depending on the model. The \"added plates\" are stacked on top. For example, Men Pro sled push = ~52 kg sled + ~150 kg in plates = 202 kg total. *(Source: pace-club.com notes sled is \"usually ~30-40 kg\"; exact sled weight varies by model)*\n\n---\n\n## 2. STATION ORDER & RUN MAPPING\n\n### The Exact Complete Race Sequence\n*(Source: Official HYROX Rulebook 2025/26 \u00a78.1 + \u00a79.1-9.8; fitnessexperiment.co; confirmed identical across all sources)*\n\n| Segment | Activity | Details |\n|---|---|---|\n| **START** | Start Tunnel | Inflatable tunnel with countdown, lights, hype |\n| **Run 1** | 1 km run | First run; may be slightly shorter, balanced later |\n| **Station 1** | **SkiErg** | 1,000 m |\n| **Run 2** | 1 km run | |\n| **Station 2** | **Sled Push** | 50 m (4 \u00d7 12.5 m) |\n| **Run 3** | 1 km run | |\n| **Station 3** | **Sled Pull** | 50 m (4 \u00d7 12.5 m) |\n| **Run 4** | 1 km run | |\n| **Station 4** | **Burpee Broad Jumps** | 80 m |\n| **Run 5** | 1 km run | |\n| **Station 5** | **Rowing** | 1,000 m |\n| **Run 6** | 1 km run | |\n| **Station 6** | **Farmer's Carry** | 200 m |\n| **Run 7** | 1 km run | |\n| **Station 7** | **Sandbag Lunges** | 100 m |\n| **Run 8** | 1 km run | |\n| **Station 8** | **Wall Balls** | 100 reps |\n| **FINISH** | Finisher Stage | Up ramp to finish line \u2014 **NO run after Wall Balls** |\n\n### Station-to-Run Mapping with Fatigue Impact\n\n| Run | Preceded By | Followed By | Fatigue Impact |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Run 1** | Start tunnel | SkiErg (St. 1) | Fresh legs; use to warm up and settle into pace. Don't blast out too fast. |\n| **Run 2** | SkiErg (St. 1) | Sled Push (St. 2) | Upper body slightly fatigued from ski pulling motion; legs relatively fresh. Breathing may be elevated. |\n| **Run 3** | Sled Push (St. 2) | Sled Pull (St. 3) | Quads and glutes fatigued from heavy sled push; this is one of the hardest runs. Legs feel heavy, especially the first 200m. |\n| **Run 4** | Sled Pull (St. 3) | Burpee Broad Jumps (St. 4) | Forearms, biceps, and back fatigued from pulling; legs had some rest during the pull. Running feels easier than post-push. |\n| **Run 5** | Burpee Broad Jumps (St. 4) | Rowing (St. 5) | Full-body fatigue; shoulders from burpees, quads from repeated jumping. Heart rate typically spikes. Mental low point for many. |\n| **Run 6** | Rowing (St. 5) | Farmer's Carry (St. 6) | Legs tired from rowing drive phase; back/arms pre-fatigued. Use this run to recover for the grip-intensive carry. |\n| **Run 7** | Farmer's Carry (St. 6) | Sandbag Lunges (St. 7) | Forearms/grip fatigued but legs relatively fresh (carry is mostly walking). However, overall accumulated fatigue is high. |\n| **Run 8** | Sandbag Lunges (St. 7) | Wall Balls (St. 8) | **The hardest run.** Quads and glutes are destroyed from 100m of lunges. Many athletes struggle to run; walking portions common. This is the most critical run to train for. |\n\n### Has the Station Order Ever Changed?\nThe station order has remained the same since HYROX's inception. It is **identical for the 2024/25 and 2025/26 seasons.** The official HYROX website and all sources confirm: \"The same eight workout stations, always in the same order.\" *(Source: fitnessexperiment.co; rezerv.co)*\n\n**One historical change:** Women's Wall Balls were increased from **75 reps to 100 reps** in the Open and Women's Doubles divisions starting from September 2024 (Cape Town event, 21 Sept 2024). Pro Women have always done 100 reps. *(Source: roxlyfe.com world records page, Note 2)*\n\n---\n\n## 3. VENUE DETAILS\n\n### Indoor/Outdoor Confirmation\n**CONFIRMED: Nearly all HYROX races are held INDOORS.**\n- Official Rulebook \u00a71 (both 2024/25 and 2025/26): *\"HYROX, an indoor mass participation fitness competition\"*\n- Typical venues: **convention centers, exhibition halls, arena/expo complexes** (e.g., ExCeL London, Javits Center NYC, Messe Hamburg)\n- **One known exception:** Wikipedia notes: *\"Occasional events have been hosted outdoors, including Miami in 2023.\"* This is extremely rare and not the norm.\n- *(Sources: HYROX Official Rulebook \u00a71; Wikipedia \"Hyrox\" article; fitnessexperiment.co)*\n\n### Running Surface\n- **Sled stations:** HYROX uses the official **HYROX \u00d7 Centr Perform Turf** \u2014 a custom-engineered 16mm polyethylene/polypropylene artificial turf specifically designed for sled push/pull. Debuted at 2025 World Championships in Chicago, now rolling out globally. *(Source: centr.com shop listing; roxlyfe.com; findyouredge.app)*\n- **Running track:** The running surface varies by venue \u2014 typically the **concrete/hard floor of the exhibition hall**, sometimes with thin carpet or rubber overlay. It is NOT on outdoor pavement, grass, or standard athletic track rubber. The floor is hard and flat.\n- **Burpee Broad Jumps / Lunges:** Generally performed on turf or the venue floor.\n- *(Source: Various race reports; HYROX turf product specs; venue walkthrough videos)*\n\n### Is the Course FLAT?\n**YES \u2014 confirmed FLAT. No hills, no elevation changes, no inclines.** All races are inside exhibition halls with level concrete floors. The only minor \"elevation\" is the small ramp up to the finisher stage at the very end. *(Source: All official rulebooks; venue walkthroughs; every course map shows flat layout)*\n\n### Turns on the Running Course\n**Yes, there are turns.** The running course is typically an oval/loop around the perimeter of the exhibition hall. Depending on the venue:\n- Rectangular venues may have **4 turns** (roughly 90-degree corners per lap)\n- Turns can be relatively tight in some venues\n- Multiple laps per 1km means multiple turns per run segment\n- At HYROX London ExCeL 2025, the course was a single full 1km lap \u2014 the first time this was done *(reducing total turns)*\n- *(Source: fitnessexperiment.co; YouTube venue walkthroughs)*\n\n### Course Layout\n- **Running course:** A **loop** around the outside perimeter of the venue (not out-and-back). The running track encircles the workout station area.\n- **Laps per 1km run:** Varies by venue:\n  - ~250m track \u2192 **4 laps** per 1km\n  - ~300-333m track \u2192 **3 laps** per 1km\n  - ~500m track \u2192 **2 laps** per 1km\n  - ~1000m track \u2192 **1 lap** (rare; HYROX London ExCeL 2025 was the first)\n  - Check venue-specific athlete guide for exact lap count\n- **Station areas:** All 8 workout stations are located **inside the running loop**, accessed through the Roxzone via IN/OUT arches\n- **Roxzone:** Transition corridor between the running track and the stations; adds approximately 700m to total distance over 8 transitions (total course distance \u2248 8.7km including Roxzone, per HYROX's own statement)\n- **Station physical placement:** Stations are not necessarily laid out in numerical order within the venue \u2014 athletes must find the correct arch for their current station number\n- *(Source: fitnessexperiment.co; Official Rulebook \u00a78.3; 2025/26 Rulebook \u00a78.3)*\n\n### Spectator Areas\n- **Spectator grandstand (\"Thunderdome\"):** Usually located near Station 8 (Wall Balls) and the finish line\n- Spectators can see the wall balls area and finish clearly\n- Spectators **cannot** see the entire race \u2014 the running track and most stations are spread across a large venue\n- Some venues have additional viewing areas along the running track or near certain stations\n- Spectators are **not permitted** in the warm-up area\n- *(Source: fitnessexperiment.co; Official 2025/26 Rulebook \u00a712.3)*\n\n### Venue Temperature\n**UNVERIFIED from official sources.** Exhibition halls are typically climate-controlled but can get warm due to:\n- Thousands of athletes generating heat\n- Indoor venues with limited airflow\n- Estimated typical conditions: 18-25\u00b0C (65-77\u00b0F), variable humidity\n- Athletes should prepare for warmer-than-expected indoor conditions\n\n---\n\n## 4.
