WORKOUT FORMAT CONSTRUCTION RULES\n\n---\n\n## 1.1 EMOM (Every Minute on the Minute)\n\n### When to Use EMOM Format\n\nEMOMs are ideal when the training goal requires **consistent, repeatable efforts with built-in rest**. They excel at:\n\n- **Skill and movement quality under mild fatigue** \u2014 the clock resets each minute, preventing technique from degrading too far (Glassman, CrossFit Level 1 Training Guide).\n- **Pacing discipline** \u2014 athletes learn to maintain a fixed output, critical for Hyrox's 8-station format where pacing errors compound.\n- **Strength-endurance development** \u2014 sub-maximal loads repeated for moderate volume with incomplete rest.\n- **Aerobic power (VO2max intervals)** \u2014 when work bouts are 40\u201350 sec with 10\u201320 sec transitions, the oxidative system is heavily taxed (Seiler & Sjursen, 2004).\n\n**Avoid EMOM when:** the goal is maximal sustained output without breaks (use AMRAP instead) or when movements are so complex that a clock-imposed pace creates injury risk.\n\n### Time Domain Guidelines\n\n| EMOM Duration | Purpose | Athlete Readiness |\n|---|---|---|\n| **8 min** | Skill-focused or high-intensity power work. Short enough that athletes can maintain near-maximal effort each minute. Good for phosphagen/glycolytic overlap. | All levels |\n| **12\u201316 min** | The \"sweet spot\" for Hyrox-specific conditioning. Mirrors the glycolytic-oxidative transition zone (2\u20134 min cumulative work). Develops the ability to repeat moderate efforts. | Intermediate+ |\n| **20\u201324 min** | Aerobic endurance emphasis. Teaches pacing over long durations. The accumulated fatigue in later minutes reveals pacing errors. Simulates Hyrox race duration in a controlled structure. | Intermediate+ with solid movement foundations |\n| **30+ min** | Long aerobic sessions or \"EMOM grinders.\" Only for well-conditioned athletes. Useful in peak Hyrox prep blocks. | Advanced only |\n\n### Work:Rest Ratio Within Each Minute\n\nThe fundamental constraint: **work must fit within the minute** and leave enough rest for the athlete to sustain quality across all rounds.\n\n| Athlete Level | Target Work per Minute | Rest per Minute | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Beginner | 25\u201335 sec | 25\u201335 sec | Err toward more rest; quality > volume |\n| Intermediate | 30\u201340 sec | 20\u201330 sec | The \"goldilocks zone\" for conditioning |\n| Advanced | 40\u201350 sec | 10\u201320 sec | High accumulated density; demanding |\n\n**Programming rule:** Estimate the athlete's rep speed, multiply by prescribed reps, and confirm the total fits within the target work window. If a movement takes 3 sec/rep (e.g., wall balls), then 10 reps = 30 sec work \u2192 appropriate for intermediate athletes.\n\n### Movement Count Per Minute\n\n| Format | Description | Best For |\n|---|---|---|\n| **1 movement/min (alternating)** | Min 1: Movement A, Min 2: Movement B, repeat | Push/pull pairing, upper/lower alternating, maximizing local recovery |\n| **2 movements/min (couplet within)** | Each minute: do A + B, rest remaining time | Higher metabolic demand, Hyrox station simulation (e.g., row + wall ball) |\n| **3 movements/min** | Rarely recommended \u2014 only for short EMOMs (8 min) with very low reps | Advanced athletes, skill-focused |\n\n### Movement Pairing Rules for EMOM\n\n| Pairing Strategy | Example | Rationale |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Push + Pull (alternating minutes)** | Min 1: Push-ups / Min 2: Ring Rows | Opposing muscle groups recover while the other works |\n| **Upper + Lower (alternating)** | Min 1: DB Push Press / Min 2: Goblet Squats | Local muscular recovery; high systemic output |\n| **Engine + Strength (alternating)** | Min 1: 15-cal Row / Min 2: 8 DB Deadlifts | Mirrors Hyrox's run\u2192station format |\n| **Same-station simulation** | Every min: 10 Wall Balls + 5 Burpees | High fatigue, competition simulation |\n\n**Avoid:** Stacking movements that share the same grip demand (deadlifts + pull-ups) or lower back demand (KB swings + rowing) within the same minute.\n\n### Rep Scheme Design\n\n**The Golden Rule:** Reps should allow completion in the target work window with good form.\n\n| Movement Speed Category | Examples | Typical Reps per Minute |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Fast cyclical** (~1.5\u20132 sec/rep) | Wall balls, box jumps, burpees | 10\u201315 reps |\n| **Moderate grind** (~2.5\u20133.5 sec/rep) | KB swings, thrusters, push-ups | 8\u201312 reps |\n| **Slow/heavy** (~4\u20135 sec/rep) | Deadlifts, heavy lunges, strict press | 5\u20138 reps |\n| **Machine/monostructural** | Row, SkiErg, bike | 12\u201318 cal or set distance |\n\n### Progression Methods (Week Over Week)\n\n| Progression Variable | Method | Rate |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Add reps** | +1\u20132 reps per movement per week | Weeks 1\u20133 of a block |\n| **Add load** | +2.5\u20135 kg per movement per week | For strength-endurance focus |\n| **Reduce rest (E2MOM \u2192 EMOM)** | Start every 2 min, progress to every 90 sec, then every 60 sec | Across a 4-week block |\n| **Extend duration** | 12-min EMOM \u2192 16-min \u2192 20-min | Across mesocycle |\n| **Increase complexity** | Single movement \u2192 couplet within each minute | When base fitness supports it |\n\n### 3 Example EMOMs\n\n#### Example 1: Hyrox Station Pairing EMOM (Intermediate)\n\n**Goal:** Aerobic power development + Hyrox station familiarity\n**Duration:** 16 minutes (8 rounds)\n\n```\nEMOM 16:\n  Min 1: 15/12-cal SkiErg\n  Min 2: 12 Wall Balls (20/14 lb to 10/9 ft target)\n```\n\n**Design Reasoning:**\n- 2-movement alternating format allows local recovery (pulling \u2192 pushing/squatting).\n- 15-cal SkiErg \u2248 35\u201340 sec for intermediate athletes \u2192 leaves 20\u201325 sec rest.\n- 12 wall balls \u2248 30\u201335 sec \u2192 leaves 25\u201330 sec rest.\n- Both movements directly simulate Hyrox stations.\n- 16 min = meaningful aerobic adaptation without excessive CNS fatigue.\n\n**Scaling:**\n- Beginner: 10/8-cal SkiErg, 8 Wall Balls (14/10 lb)\n- Advanced: 18/15-cal SkiErg, 15 Wall Balls (20/14 lb)\n\n---\n\n#### Example 2: Strength-Endurance EMOM (Advanced)\n\n**Goal:** Strength-endurance under fatigue; heavy farmer carry + lunge prep\n**Duration:** 20 minutes (5 rounds)\n\n```\nEMOM 20:\n  Min 1: 8 Heavy KB Deadlifts (2x32/24 kg)\n  Min 2: 50m Farmer Carry (2x32/24 kg)\n  Min 3: 12 Alternating DB Lunges (2x22.5/15 kg)\n  Min 4: 15/12-cal Row\n```\n\n**Design Reasoning:**\n- 4-movement rotation \u2192 each muscle group gets 3 minutes of recovery before repeating.\n- Deadlift \u2192 carry \u2192 lunge progression loads the posterior chain and legs in different patterns.\n- Row in minute 4 provides active recovery for legs (seated) while maintaining cardiac output.\n- Heavy loads develop specific Hyrox strength (sled push/pull, sandbag carry/lunge transfer).\n\n**Scaling:**\n- Beginner: Reduce to EMOM 12 (3 rounds), lighter loads by 30\u201340%\n- Intermediate: EMOM 16 (4 rounds), moderate loads\n\n---\n\n#### Example 3: Speed/Power EMOM (All Levels)\n\n**Goal:** Alactic power development; fast-twitch recruitment for burpee broad jumps\n**Duration:** 8 minutes\n\n```\nEMOM 8:\n  Min 1: 5 Burpee Broad Jumps (max distance per jump)\n  Min 2: 10 Russian KB Swings (24/16 kg, explosive)\n```\n\n**Design Reasoning:**\n- Short 8-min domain \u2192 athletes can maintain maximal intent each minute.\n- 5 burpee broad jumps \u2248 20\u201325 sec \u2192 35+ sec rest \u2192 sufficient for near-full phosphagen recovery.\n- KB swings complement: hip extension power without the ground-to-standing transition.\n- Focus on QUALITY and POWER, not grinding through fatigue.\n\n**Scaling:**\n- Beginner: 3 Burpee Broad Jumps, 8 KB Swings (16/12 kg)\n- Advanced: 7 Burpee Broad Jumps, 12 KB Swings (32/24 kg)\n\n---\n\n## 1.2 AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible)\n\n### When to Use AMRAP Format\n\nAMRAPs are optimal when the goal is **maximal sustained output over a fixed time domain**. They inherently teach pacing \u2014 athletes who go too hard early slow down; those who pace well accumulate more work. This directly transfers to Hyrox race strategy (Bergeron, 2016).\n\nBest applications:\n- **Aerobic capacity development** \u2014 longer AMRAPs (12\u201320 min) build the oxidative engine.\n- **Mental toughness and pacing** \u2014 athletes must manage fatigue, exactly as in Hyrox.\n- **Benchmarking and progress tracking** \u2014 score = total rounds + reps; easy to compare over time.\n- **Competition simulation** \u2014 self-paced effort under time pressure.\n\n### Time Domain Guidelines\n\n| AMRAP Duration | Purpose | Character |\n|---|---|---|\n| **5 min** | Glycolytic power. Fast, aggressive. Athletes should feel like they're redlining by min 3. Tests anaerobic capacity. | Sprint |\n| **8\u201312 min** | The Hyrox \"station block\" simulator. Glycolytic-oxidative transition. Teaches moderate-hard pacing. | Threshold |\n| **15\u201320 min** | Aerobic capacity. Sustainable pace. Must plan transitions. Most transferable to full Hyrox race pacing. | Sustained |\n| **25\u201330 min** | Long aerobic grinder. Only for advanced athletes in peak prep. Tests mental fortitude + fueling. | Endurance |\n\n### Movement Count\n\n| Count | Style | Best For |\n|---|---|---|\n| **2 movements (couplet)** | Fast cycling, high cardiac output | Short AMRAPs (5\u201312 min). Simple decision-making under fatigue. |\n| **3 movements (triplet)** | Balanced loading, more variety | Medium AMRAPs (10\u201320 min). Can alternate body regions. |\n| **4+ movements (chipper-style)** | Each round is a mini-journey | Long AMRAPs (15\u201330 min). Prevents monotony. Mimics Hyrox multi-station feel. |\n\n### Rep Scheme Design: Avoiding Bottlenecks\n\n**Key Principle:** No single movement should take more than ~40% of the round's total time. If one movement dominates, athletes stall there and the workout loses its intended stimulus.\n\n**Formula:**\n1. Estimate time per rep for each movement.\n2. Multiply by prescribed reps.\n3. Calculate each movement's % of total round time.\n4. Adjust reps until balanced (each movement = 25\u201340% of round time in a triplet).\n\n| Movement | Time/Rep | Reps | Time | % of Round |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Row (calories) | ~4 sec/cal | 12 cal | 48 sec | 38% |\n| Wall Balls | ~3 sec | 12 | 36 sec | 28% |\n| Burpees | ~5 sec | 8 | 40 sec | 32% |\n| **Total** | | | **~2:04/round** | |\n\nThis is balanced. If burpees were 15 reps (75 sec), they'd dominate the round at 50%+ \u2192 reduce to 8\u201310.\n\n### Scoring: Target Scores by Fitness Level\n\nFor a ~2:00/round AMRAP:\n\n| Duration | Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced | Elite |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 5 min | 2 rounds | 2+\u00bd rounds | 3 rounds | 3+\u00bd rounds |\n| 12 min | 4\u20135 rounds | 6 rounds | 7\u20138 rounds | 9+ rounds |\n| 20 min | 7\u20138 rounds | 9\u201310 rounds | 11\u201313 rounds | 14+ rounds |\n\n### Progression Methods\n\n| Method | Description |\n|---|---|\n| **Add reps** | Same time, more work per round \u2192 fewer rounds but more total volume |\n| **Add load** | Heavier wall ball, heavier KB \u2192 slower rounds, more strength stimulus |\n| **Extend time** | 12-min AMRAP \u2192 16-min \u2192 20-min |\n| **Increase movement complexity** | Burpees \u2192 burpee broad jumps; squats \u2192 lunges |\n| **Beat previous score** | Same workout, aim for +1 round or +5 reps |\n\n### 3 Example AMRAPs\n\n#### Example 1: Hyrox Race Simulation AMRAP (Intermediate)\n\n**Goal:** Full-race pacing practice; aerobic capacity\n**Duration:** 20 min AMRAP\n\n```\n20-min AMRAP:\n  200m Run\n  15 Wall Balls (20/14 lb)\n  12/10-cal SkiErg\n  10 Alternating DB Lunges (2x15/10 kg)\n```\n\n**Design Reasoning:**\n- 4 movements mimic the Hyrox run\u2192station flow.\n- Estimated round time: ~2:30\u20133:00 \u2192 target 7\u20138 rounds for intermediate.\n- Run opens each round (just like Hyrox). Wall balls and SkiErg are direct station simulators. Lunges simulate the sandbag lunge station.\n- No single movement dominates: run \u2248 50 sec, wall balls \u2248 45 sec, SkiErg \u2248 40 sec, lunges \u2248 35 sec.\n\n**Scaling:**\n- Beginner: 100m Run, 10 Wall Balls (14/10 lb), 8/6-cal SkiErg, 8 Goblet Lunges (light)\n- Advanced: 250m Run, 15 Wall Balls (20/14 lb), 15/12-cal SkiErg, 12 Lunges (2x22.5/15 kg)\n\n---\n\n#### Example 2: Short Glycolytic Blast (All Levels)\n\n**Goal:** Anaerobic capacity; fast turnover; burpee tolerance\n**Duration:** 5 min AMRAP\n\n```\n5-min AMRAP:\n  5 Burpee Broad Jumps\n  10 KB Swings (24/16 kg)\n```\n\n**Design Reasoning:**\n- Couplet for simplicity \u2192 minimal transition time \u2192 maximum output.\n- 5 burpee broad jumps \u2248 25 sec; 10 KB swings \u2248 20 sec \u2192 ~45 sec/round.\n- Target: 5\u20137 rounds. Athletes should feel anaerobic distress by round 4.\n- Direct Hyrox transfer: burpee broad jump station + hip extension power.\n\n**Scaling:**\n- Beginner: 3 Burpees (no broad jump), 8 KB Swings (16/12 kg)\n- Advanced: 7 Burpee Broad Jumps, 12 KB Swings (32/24 kg)\n\n---\n\n#### Example 3: Upper/Lower Balanced AMRAP (Intermediate-Advanced)\n\n**Goal:** Balanced muscular endurance; push/pull/squat/hinge\n**Duration:** 15 min AMRAP\n\n```\n15-min AMRAP:\n  12/10-cal Row\n  10 Push-Ups\n  8 Goblet Squats (24/16 kg)\n  6 Pull-Ups (or Ring Rows)\n```\n\n**Design Reasoning:**\n- Triplet + monostructural opener. Row taxes legs/back \u2192 push-ups shift to upper push \u2192 squats return to legs \u2192 pull-ups hit upper pull.\n- No grip stacking: row \u2192 push-ups (no grip) \u2192 squats (front rack, light grip) \u2192 pull-ups (grip).\n- Estimated round time: ~1:45 \u2192 target 8\u20139 rounds.\n\n**Scaling:**\n- Beginner: 8/6-cal Row, 8 Knee Push-Ups, 8 Air Squats, 6 Ring Rows\n- Advanced: 15/12-cal Row, 12 Push-Ups, 10 Goblet Squats (32/24 kg), 8 Pull-Ups\n\n---\n\n## 1.3 For Time / Task Priority\n\n### When to Use For Time Format\n\n\"For Time\" workouts set a fixed amount of work and challenge the athlete to complete it as fast as possible. Use when:\n\n- **Race simulation** \u2014 Hyrox itself is a \"for time\" event. This format trains the competitive mindset.\n- **Testing maximal sustainable pace** \u2014 athletes must decide how hard to push, with real consequences for going too hard.\n- **Benchmarking** \u2014 completion time is a precise, repeatable metric.\n- **Mental resilience** \u2014 the work is defined; you can't hide from it.\n\n### Estimating Appropriate Total Volume\n\n**Target completion times by training context:**\n\n| Purpose | Target Completion Time | Volume Implication |\n|---|---|---|\n| Speed/power test | 3\u20137 min | Low total volume, high intensity |\n| Conditioning test | 8\u201315 min | Moderate volume, threshold intensity |\n| Endurance simulation | 15\u201325 min | High volume, sustainable pace |\n| Full race simulation | 25\u201340 min | Very high volume; advanced only |\n\n**Volume estimation formula:**\n1. List all movements and reps.\n2. Estimate time per rep \u00d7 reps for each.\n3. Sum all movement times.\n4. Add 10\u201315% for transitions and rest.\n5. Confirm total falls within target window.\n\n### Time Cap Setting\n\n| Athlete Level | Time Cap as % of Expected Completion | Purpose |\n|---|---|---|\n| Beginner | 150\u2013200% of \"intended\" time | Safety net; prevents excessive grinding |\n| Intermediate | 120\u2013130% | Allows completion with moderate pacing errors |\n| Advanced | 100\u2013110% | Tight cap; demands aggressive pacing |\n\nExample: If a workout is designed to take ~15 min for an intermediate athlete, set the time cap at 18\u201320 min.\n\n### Movement Ordering Principles\n\n| Principle | Reasoning |\n|---|---|\n| **Technical/complex movements first** | Athletes are freshest and safest. (NSCA, Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning, 4th Ed.) |\n| **High-skill before high-fatigue** | e.g., Lunges before burpees \u2014 not the reverse |\n| **Alternate movement patterns** | Don't stack deadlifts \u2192 rows \u2192 KB swings (all hip hinge/back) |\n| **Save monostructural for transitions** | Running or rowing between strength movements allows partial recovery |\n| **End with a \"sprint finish\"** | Place a simple, high-output movement last (e.g., burpees, row cals) to allow athletes to empty the tank |\n\n### Chipper vs. Repeated Rounds\n\n| Format | When to Use | Example |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Chipper (single pass)** | High variety, race simulation, mental challenge of ticking off stations | 1 km Row, 50 Wall Balls, 400m Run, 40 KB Swings, 200m Run, 30 Burpees |\n| **Repeated rounds** | When consistency and pacing are the focus; allows round-to-round comparison | 5 Rounds: 400m Run, 15 Wall Balls, 10 Burpees |\n\n### Progression Methods\n\n- **Increase total volume:** add reps or rounds\n- **Increase load:** heavier implements\n- **Tighten time cap:** same work, less time allowed\n- **Add a movement:** e.g., 3-movement workout \u2192 4-movement\n- **Increase distances:** 200m run \u2192 400m run\n\n### 3 Example For Time Workouts\n\n#### Example 1: Hyrox Half-Race Chipper (Advanced)\n\n**Goal:** Race simulation for second half of Hyrox\n**Time Cap:** 25 min\n\n```\nFor Time:\n  1,000m Row\n  50 Wall Balls (20/14 lb)\n  400m Run\n  200m Farmer Carry (2x32/24 kg)\n  400m Run\n  100m Sandbag Lunges (20/15 kg)\n  400m Run\n  75 Burpee Broad Jumps\n```\n\n**Design Reasoning:**\n- Chipper format mimics Hyrox's one-pass-through structure.\n- Movements are ordered to distribute fatigue: row (full body) \u2192 wall balls (legs/shoulders) \u2192 carry (grip/core) \u2192 lunges (legs/back) \u2192 burpees (full body finisher).\n- Runs between stations replicate the Hyrox structure.\n- Burpees last \u2014 simple, grind-it-out movement when exhausted.\n\n**Scaling:**\n- Beginner: Cut all volumes by 50%. Reduce loads by 30\u201340%. Time cap 35 min.\n- Intermediate: Cut volumes by 25%. Time cap 28 min.\n\n---\n\n#### Example 2: Repeated Round Pacer (Intermediate)\n\n**Goal:** Pacing practice; consistent round times\n**Time Cap:** 18 min\n\n```\n5 Rounds For Time:\n  200m Run\n  15 KB Swings (24/16 kg)\n  10 Push-Ups\n  5 Burpees\n```\n\n**Design Reasoning:**\n- 5 identical rounds \u2192 athletes can (and should) target consistent splits.\n- Estimated round time: ~2:30 \u2192 total ~12:30\u201315:00 for intermediate.\n- Movement ordering: run (systemic), swings (posterior chain), push-ups (upper push, no grip), burpees (finisher).\n- No grip stacking: KB swings \u2192 push-ups (grip-free) \u2192 burpees (grip-free).\n\n**Scaling:**\n- Beginner: 3 Rounds, 100m Run, 10 KB Swings (16/12 kg), 8 Knee Push-Ups, 3 Burpees. Time cap 15 min.\n- Advanced: 7 Rounds, 200m Run, 15 KB Swings (32/24 kg), 15 Push-Ups, 8 Burpees. Time cap 20 min.\n\n---\n\n#### Example 3: Sprint For Time (All Levels)\n\n**Goal:** Glycolytic capacity; fast and punishing\n**Time Cap:** 8 min\n\n```\nFor Time:\n  30/24-cal SkiErg\n  30 Wall Balls (20/14 lb)\n  30 Burpees\n```\n\n**Design Reasoning:**\n- 3 movements \u00d7 30 reps = \"30-30-30\" \u2014 simple, memorable.\n- Expected completion: 5\u20137 min for intermediate. Fast enough to be glycolytic but with volume demanding pacing.\n- SkiErg \u2192 Wall Balls \u2192 Burpees: pulling \u2192 pushing/squatting \u2192 full body. No movement pattern overlap.\n- Descending skill requirement (SkiErg most technical \u2192 burpees least).\n\n**Scaling:**\n- Beginner: 20/16-cal SkiErg, 20 Wall Balls (14/10 lb), 20 Burpees (step-back). Time cap 12 min.\n- Advanced: 40/32-cal SkiErg, 40 Wall Balls (20/14 lb), 40 Burpees.

Use when:\n\n- You need to **isolate a specific energy system** (phosphagen, glycolytic, oxidative).\n- You want **controlled intensity** \u2014 the rest period dictates recovery and subsequent effort quality.\n- The athlete needs **repeatability at high intensity** \u2014 can't achieve this in an AMRAP where pacing self-selects.\n- Specific **race-pace training** \u2014 e.g., \"Hyrox station pace\" intervals.\n\n### Work:Rest Ratios by Energy System\n\n| Energy System | Work Duration | Work:Rest Ratio | Intensity | Sets | Total Session Duration | Application |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **Phosphagen (Alactic)** | 5\u201315 sec | 1:3 to 1:5 | 95\u2013100% | 6\u201310 | 10\u201315 min | Sprint starts, explosive burpee broad jumps, maximal sled push starts |\n| **Glycolytic (Lactic)** | 30\u201390 sec | 1:1 to 1:2 | 85\u201395% | 4\u20138 | 15\u201325 min | Hyrox station-pace efforts, threshold tolerance |\n| **Oxidative (Aerobic Power)** | 2\u20135 min | 1:0.5 to 1:1 | 75\u201385% | 3\u20136 | 20\u201340 min | VO2max development, sustained Hyrox pacing |\n| **Oxidative (Aerobic Endurance)** | 5\u201310 min | 1:0.25 to 1:0.5 | 65\u201375% | 2\u20134 | 30\u201350 min | Base building, long race prep |\n\n### Movement Selection by Energy System\n\n| System | Ideal Movement Characteristics | Examples |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Phosphagen** | Simple, explosive, max-effort | Bike sprint, sled push sprint, burpee broad jump for distance |\n| **Glycolytic** | Moderate complexity, high power output sustainable for 30\u201390 sec | Row intervals, SkiErg intervals, wall balls, KB swings |\n| **Oxidative** | Low-moderate complexity, repeatable | Running, rowing, SkiErg, mixed-modal circuits |\n\n### Progression Methods\n\n1. **Increase work duration** (e.g., 30 sec \u2192 45 sec \u2192 60 sec at same intensity)\n2. **Decrease rest** (e.g., 1:2 \u2192 1:1.5 \u2192 1:1)\n3. **Add sets** (e.g., 4 sets \u2192 5 \u2192 6)\n4. **Increase intensity/load** (faster pace, heavier sled)\n5. **Progress from single-modal to mixed-modal** (row only \u2192 row + wall balls)\n\n### 3 Example Interval Sessions\n\n#### Example 1: Glycolytic Station Intervals (Intermediate)\n\n**Goal:** Hyrox station-pace tolerance; lactate buffering\n**Energy System:** Glycolytic\n\n```\n6 Rounds:\n  60 sec: Max-cal SkiErg\n  60 sec: Rest\n  \n  Record calories each round. Target: consistent cals (\u00b12) across all 6 rounds.\n```\n\n**Design Reasoning:**\n- 1:1 work:rest \u2192 glycolytic system primary driver.\n- 60-sec work bouts match Hyrox SkiErg station duration for faster athletes.\n- Consistency target teaches pacing \u2014 if round 1 is 18 cal and round 6 is 11 cal, the athlete went out too hard.\n\n**Scaling:**\n- Beginner: 4 rounds, 45 sec work, 75 sec rest (1:1.7)\n- Advanced: 8 rounds, 60 sec work, 45 sec rest (1:0.75)\n\n---\n\n#### Example 2: Oxidative Power Intervals (Advanced)\n\n**Goal:** VO2max development; race-pace sustained efforts\n**Energy System:** Aerobic Power\n\n```\n5 Rounds:\n  3:00 Work: 200m Run + 15 Wall Balls (20/14 lb) + Max-cal Row in remaining time\n  2:00 Rest\n  \n  Score = total Row calories across all 5 rounds.\n```\n\n**Design Reasoning:**\n- 3-min work intervals at 1:0.67 rest \u2192 heavy oxidative demand with meaningful anaerobic contribution.\n- Mixed-modal within each interval simulates Hyrox transitions.\n- Row cals as the \"score\" incentivize athletes to move quickly through run and wall balls.\n- 5 rounds \u00d7 5 min = 25 min total \u2192 appropriate session length.\n\n**Scaling:**\n- Beginner: 3 rounds, 3:00 work (100m run, 10 wall balls, row), 3:00 rest\n- Intermediate: 4 rounds, 3:00 work, 2:00 rest\n\n---\n\n#### Example 3: Phosphagen Power Sprints (All Levels)\n\n**Goal:** Explosive power; sled push start speed\n**Energy System:** Phosphagen/Alactic\n\n```\n8 Rounds:\n  10 sec: All-Out Assault Bike Sprint\n  50 sec: Complete Rest (walk around, shake out)\n  \n  Record peak watts each round.\n```\n\n**Design Reasoning:**\n- 10-sec work, 50-sec rest = 1:5 ratio \u2192 full phosphagen recovery between sets.\n- Assault bike is safe for maximal sprints (no eccentric loading, no technique breakdown).\n- Peak watts as metric \u2192 if watts drop >15% from round 1, athlete is exceeding phosphagen capacity.\n- 8 rounds in 8 min \u2192 efficient session.\n\n**Scaling:**\n- Beginner: 6 rounds, 8 sec work, 52 sec rest\n- Advanced: 10 rounds, 12 sec work, 48 sec rest\n\n---\n\n## 1.5 Tabata\n\n### Classic Tabata Format\n\nThe original Tabata protocol (Tabata et al., 1996): **20 sec work / 10 sec rest \u00d7 8 rounds = 4 minutes total**. Originally performed on a cycle ergometer at 170% VO2max.\n\n**When it's appropriate:**\n- Short, brutal conditioning finishers.\n- When time is extremely limited (4\u20138 min available).\n- For movements that can be performed at maximal effort safely with rapid transitions.\n- NOT appropriate for heavy or technically complex movements (the 10-sec rest is too short for setup).\n\n### Modified Tabata Formats\n\n| Format | Work:Rest | Rounds | Total Time | Use Case |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **Classic** | 20:10 | 8 | 4:00 | Maximum intensity, single simple movement |\n| **Extended** | 30:15 | 8 | 6:00 | Slightly more work capacity focused; allows more complex movements |\n| **Heavy** | 40:20 | 6\u20138 | 6:00\u20138:00 | Strength-endurance; heavier loads sustainable for 40 sec |\n| **Double Tabata** | 20:10 | 16 (2 movements) | 8:00 | 8 rounds movement A, then 8 rounds movement B |\n\n### Movement Selection for Tabata\n\n| \u2705 Good for Tabata | \u274c Bad for Tabata |\n|---|---|\n| Air squats, burpees, mountain climbers | Barbell snatches (too technical under fatigue) |\n| KB swings, ball slams, battle ropes | Heavy deadlifts (injury risk with 10-sec rest) |\n| Assault bike, rower sprints | Handstand push-ups (setup time) |\n| Push-ups, sit-ups, box jumps | Complex Olympic lifts |\n| Wall balls (if target is close) | Movements requiring equipment changes |\n\n### 2 Example Tabata Sessions\n\n#### Example 1: Classic Double Tabata Finisher (All Levels)\n\n**Goal:** Metabolic conditioning finisher; Hyrox movement pattern training\n\n```\nTabata 1 (4:00): Wall Balls (20/14 lb)\n  20 sec max reps / 10 sec rest \u00d7 8 rounds\n  \nRest 1:00\n\nTabata 2 (4:00): Burpees\n  20 sec max reps / 10 sec rest \u00d7 8 rounds\n\nTotal time: 9:00\nScore: Total reps (wall balls + burpees separately)\n```\n\n**Design Reasoning:**\n- Two Hyrox-specific movements in pure Tabata format.\n- Wall balls first (more technical, requires target) while fresher.\n- Burpees second (simpler, can grind through fatigue).\n- Score allows tracking: typical intermediate scores \u2014 wall balls: 70\u201390 total reps, burpees: 50\u201365 total reps.\n\n**Scaling:**\n- Beginner: 14/10 lb wall ball, step-back burpees; record reps and aim to improve\n- Advanced: 20/14 lb wall ball, burpee broad jumps\n\n---\n\n#### Example 2: Modified Heavy Tabata (Intermediate-Advanced)\n\n**Goal:** Strength-endurance conditioning; grip and core\n\n```\n40 sec work / 20 sec rest \u00d7 6 rounds per movement, rotating:\n\nRound 1: KB Swings (24/16 kg)\nRound 2: Farmer Hold in Place (2x32/24 kg) \u2014 just hold, don't walk\nRound 3: KB Swings\nRound 4: Farmer Hold\nRound 5: KB Swings\nRound 6: Farmer Hold\n\nTotal time: 6:00\n```\n\n**Design Reasoning:**\n- 40:20 allows heavier loads than classic 20:10.\n- Alternating dynamic (swings) with isometric (farmer hold) trains grip endurance from two angles.\n- Direct Hyrox transfer: KB swing power + farmer carry grip stamina.\n- 6 minutes total = effective finisher or part of a larger session.\n\n**Scaling:**\n- Beginner: 30:15 format, lighter KBs (16/12 kg, 24/16 kg holds)\n- Advanced: 40:20, heavier KBs (32/24 kg swings, 2x40/32 kg holds)\n\n---\n\n# 2. MOVEMENT PAIRING PRINCIPLES\n\n---\n\n## 2.1 Push/Pull Pairing\n\n**Concept:** Pair a pushing movement with a pulling movement to allow agonist/antagonist recovery.\n\n| Push | Pull | Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n| Push-ups | Ring Rows | Bodyweight, accessible |\n| DB Bench Press | DB Bent-Over Row | Same equipment |\n| DB Push Press | Pull-ups | Vertical push + vertical pull |\n| Wall Balls (push component) | SkiErg (pull component) | Hyrox-specific |\n\n**When to use:** EMOMs (alternating minutes), supersets in strength work, moderate-intensity conditioning.\n**When to avoid:** In high-fatigue scenarios where grip is a limiter \u2014 push-ups don't need grip, but rows and pull-ups do, so stacking multiple pulling movements is the real risk.\n\n## 2.2 Upper/Lower Alternating\n\n**Concept:** Alternate upper-body and lower-body dominant movements so that local muscular fatigue dissipates while systemic cardiovascular demand remains high.\n\n| Upper | Lower | Combined Effect |\n|---|---|---|\n| Push-ups | Goblet Squats | Chest/triceps rest during squats; quads rest during push-ups |\n| Pull-ups | Lunges | Lats/biceps rest during lunges |\n| DB Push Press | KB Deadlifts | Shoulders rest during deadlifts |\n| SkiErg | Wall Sits | Full-body pull recovery during isometric hold |\n\n**Benefit for Hyrox:** Hyrox naturally alternates patterns (running = lower \u2192 SkiErg = upper \u2192 running \u2192 sled push = lower). Training in this pattern builds sport-specific work capacity.\n\n## 2.3 Hyrox Station Simulation Pairing\n\n| Hyrox Station | Primary Gym Simulator | Secondary Alternatives | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **1 km SkiErg** | SkiErg | Battle ropes (30 sec intervals), banded lat pull-downs for reps, heavy ball slams | Nothing perfectly replaces SkiErg; battle ropes are closest for upper-body pulling endurance |\n| **50m Sled Push** | Heavy prowler/sled push | Heavy wall pushes (iso), weighted bear crawls, leg press (high volume), heavy band-resisted marching | Focus on heavy horizontal pushing with leg drive |\n| **50m Sled Pull** | Hand-over-hand rope sled pull | Seated cable row (heavy, high rep), heavy band pulls, rope climbs (grip + pull) | Grip + upper back endurance is key stimulus |\n| **80m Burpee Broad Jump** | Burpee broad jumps | Burpee + box jump, burpee + tuck jump, lateral burpees (limited space) | Nothing replaces the BBJ fully; simulate distance by counting reps |\n| **1 km Row** | Rowing ergometer | Fan bike/Assault bike, ring rows + air squats combined | Bike captures the leg drive + cardio; ring rows add the pull |\n| **200m Farmer Carry** | Farmer carry (heavy KBs/DBs) | Trap bar carry, heavy DB hold + walk, loaded backpack walks | Load and distance are the key variables |\n| **100m Sandbag Lunges** | Sandbag lunge (front-loaded) | Goblet lunges, front rack barbell lunges, D-ball bear hug lunges, heavy backpack lunges | Front-loading is critical \u2014 back-loaded lunges miss the anterior core demand |\n| **75 Wall Balls** | Wall balls (to regulation height) | Thrusters (DB or BB), front squat + push press, med ball cleans + press | Full squat depth + overhead push; thrusters are the closest substitute |\n\n## 2.4 Movement Complexity Sequencing\n\n### Technical Movements: Place First\n\nMovements requiring coordination, timing, or high skill should be performed while the athlete is freshest:\n- Burpee broad jumps (timing of jump)\n- SkiErg (technique-dependent efficiency)\n- Lunges under load (balance)\n- Wall balls (depth, accuracy, rhythm)\n\n### Fatigue Stacking Rules\n\n| \u274c Avoid This Stack | Why | \u2705 Better Alternative |\n|---|---|---|\n| Deadlifts \u2192 Bent-Over Rows | Lower back fatigue compounds \u2192 injury risk | Deadlifts \u2192 Push-ups \u2192 Rows |\n| Pull-ups \u2192 KB Swings \u2192 Farmer Carry | Grip fatigue \u00d7 3 consecutive movements | Pull-ups \u2192 Squats \u2192 Farmer Carry |\n| Rowing \u2192 Deadlifts \u2192 KB Swings | Posterior chain + lower back \u00d7 3 | Rowing \u2192 Wall Balls \u2192 KB Swings |\n| Heavy Lunges \u2192 Running \u2192 Sled Push | Quad fatigue \u00d7 3 \u2192 blown legs | Lunges \u2192 SkiErg \u2192 Sled Push (upper/lower alternation) |\n| Wall Balls \u2192 Thrusters \u2192 Push Press | Shoulder fatigue \u00d7 3 | Wall Balls \u2192 Row \u2192 Push Press |\n\n**Golden Rule:** Never stack more than 2 movements with the same primary fatigue site. Insert a contrasting movement in between.\n\n---\n\n## 2.5 Movement Selection Matrix (30+ Movements)\n\nThis is the core reference table for the workout generation engine.

SCALING & MODIFICATION FRAMEWORK\n\n---\n\n## 4.1 Scaling by Fitness Level\n\n### Beginner Modifications by Workout Format\n\n| Format | Modification | Reasoning |\n|---|---|---|\n| **EMOM** | Extend to E2MOM (every 2 min); reduce reps by 40\u201350%; simplify movements | More rest ensures quality; prevents technique breakdown |\n| **AMRAP** | Reduce time domain by 30%; reduce reps per round by 30\u201340%; use bodyweight alternatives | Shorter AMRAPs prevent excessive fatigue accumulation |\n| **For Time** | Increase time cap by 50\u2013100%; reduce total volume by 40\u201350%; remove most complex movement | Generous time cap prevents panic; less volume = manageable |\n| **Intervals** | Reduce sets by 30\u201340%; increase rest ratio by 50%; lower intensity targets | More recovery between efforts; quality over quantity |\n| **Tabata** | Use :20 work / :20 rest (instead of :10 rest); reduce to 6 rounds; use simple movements only | Extra rest prevents complete breakdown; fewer rounds |\n\n### Complexity Reduction Without Losing Intent\n\n| Prescribed Movement | Beginner Sub | Training Intent Preserved |\n|---|---|---|\n| Burpee Broad Jump | Step-back Burpee | Ground-to-standing + cardiovascular demand \u2713 |\n| Pull-Up | Ring Row (feet elevated) | Horizontal pull strength \u2713 |\n| BB Thruster | Goblet Squat + Push Press (separate) | Squat + press pattern \u2713 |\n| Sandbag Lunge | Goblet Reverse Lunge (in place) | Front-loaded single-leg work \u2713; eliminates walking balance demand |\n| Sled Push (heavy) | Wall push (isometric, timed) | Leg drive pattern \u2713; eliminates load management |\n| SkiErg (1 km) | 3 \u00d7 1:00 Battle Ropes w/ 30 sec rest | Upper body pull endurance \u2713; breaks up duration |\n\n### Rep Scheme Scaling Table\n\n| Level | % of Prescribed Reps | % of Prescribed Load | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Beginner** | 50\u201360% | 50\u201360% | Focus on movement quality; complete all reps cleanly |\n| **Intermediate** | 75\u201390% | 75\u201390% | Should be challenging but sustainable |\n| **Advanced (Rx)** | 100% | 100% | As prescribed |\n| **Elite / Competition** | 110\u2013120% | 100\u2013110% | Overreach phase only; higher volume or load |\n\n## 4.2 Scaling by Available Time\n\n### 45-min Workout \u2192 30 min\n\n| Component | Keep/Cut | Priority |\n|---|---|---|\n| Warm-up (10 min) | **Keep but reduce to 5\u20137 min** | Essential for injury prevention \u2014 cut general cardio, keep dynamic stretching and movement prep |\n| Strength/skill (10 min) | **Cut or combine with conditioning** | If the workout has a separate strength block, make it part of the conditioning (e.g., add deadlifts into the AMRAP) |\n| Conditioning (20 min) | **Reduce to 15 min** | Reduce rounds, distance, or time domain \u2014 NOT intensity |\n| Cool-down (5 min) | **Keep 2\u20133 min** | Light walk/stretch |\n\n### 30-min Workout \u2192 20 min\n\n| Strategy | Implementation |\n|---|---|\n| **Cut warm-up to 3\u20134 min** | Movement-specific only: 10 reps of each workout movement at light load |\n| **Combine all work into one conditioning block** | No separate strength work; make the conditioning piece include loaded movements |\n| **Reduce time domain by 30%** | 20-min AMRAP \u2192 14-min; 5 rounds \u2192 3 rounds |\n| **Cut cool-down** | Acknowledge the trade-off; recommend athlete does their own later |\n\n### Rules for Preserving Intent When Compressing\n\n1. **Never cut intensity** \u2014 if the workout is meant to be hard, keep it hard; just do less of it.\n2. **Maintain the movement pattern balance** \u2014 if the original has push/pull/squat/hinge, the shortened version should too.\n3. **Prioritize sport-specific movements** \u2014 in a Hyrox program, keep wall balls and burpees over bicep curls.\n4. **Keep the \"hardest\" element** \u2014 if the workout's purpose is sled push tolerance, don't remove the sled push.\n5. **Reduce volume before reducing variety** \u2014 8 reps of 4 movements > 15 reps of 2 movements.\n\n## 4.3 Scaling for Injuries and Limitations\n\n### Upper Body Limitations\n\n| Limitation | Affected Movements | Modifications |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Shoulder injury** | Push-ups, push press, wall balls, SkiErg, overhead movements | Replace with: incline push-ups (pain-free angle), landmine press, front squat instead of wall ball, bike instead of SkiErg |\n| **Elbow/wrist injury** | Push-ups, front rack, farmer carry grip | Replace with: DB floor press (neutral grip), zercher squats, forearm-strap farmer carries, bike |\n| **General upper body** | All pressing and pulling | Focus programming on legs + monostructural cardio: running, assault bike (legs only), squats, lunges, sled push (arms-free if possible), step-ups |\n\n### Lower Body Limitations\n\n| Limitation | Affected Movements | Modifications |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Knee injury** | Squats, lunges, running, box jumps | Replace with: bike (limited ROM if needed), wall balls with shallow squat, step-ups to low box, sled pull (upper body focus), swimming |\n| **Ankle injury** | Running, box jumps, lunges, squats | Replace with: bike, rowing, SkiErg, seated movements, upper body focus. Squats to a box (controlled depth) |\n| **Hip injury** | Squats, deadlifts, lunges, running | Replace with: bike (if hip tolerates), SkiErg, upper body circuits, isometric bridges (if pain-free) |\n| **General lower body** | All squat/lunge/run/jump | Focus on upper body + monostructural: SkiErg, rowing, battle ropes, push-ups, pull-ups, seated movements |\n\n### Grip Limitations\n\n| Affected Hyrox Movements | Modifications |\n|---|---|\n| **Farmer Carry** | Forearm strap carries; lighter weight for longer distance; rack carry (rests on forearms) |\n| **Sled Pull** | Use towel/strap wraps; reduce load by 30\u201340%; cable machine seated rows (padded handles) |\n| **Rowing Erg** | Wrist straps on handle; reduce distance, increase bike substitution |\n| **KB Swings / Deadlifts** | Use straps; reduce reps, increase load per rep (fewer total grip demands) |\n| **General approach** | Limit grip-intensive movements to 1 per workout; supplement with grip rehab (rice bucket, band extensions) |\n\n### Cardio Limitations (Asthma, Returning from Illness, Deconditioning)\n\n| Modification Principle | Implementation |\n|---|---|\n| **Reduce intensity before volume** | Keep workout structure but target RPE 5\u20136 instead of 7\u20138 |\n| **Extend rest periods by 50\u2013100%** | EMOM \u2192 E2MOM; 1:1 intervals \u2192 1:2",
