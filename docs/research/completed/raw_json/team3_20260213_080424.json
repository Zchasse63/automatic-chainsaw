          "snippet": "### Bottom Line\n\nThe Functional Bodybuilding Persist Program designed by Marcus Filly, former CrossFit games athlete, offers exceptional programming for folks looking to improve mobility and increase muscle mass at the same time. Mobility and recovery is built-in to the warm-ups, cool-downs, and addressed on non-lifting days. It\u2019s also appropriate for folks with limited equipment. There are five different tracks you can choose from and one offers minimal or no equipment and you can still see results.\n\n\u2026\n\n## FBB Persist Program Specs\n\n|Price|$39/month; $99/quarter; $325/year|\n|--|--|\n|Workout tracks|Pillars, Pump Lift, Pump Condition, Perform, Minimalist|\n|Types of training|Minimal equipment workouts, hypertrophy, conditioning, and/or Olympic lifting|\n|Extras|Weekly emails, video messages from Marcus Filly, vast library of demo videos|\n|Gym membership required|No|\n|Workout per week|4-5 depending on track|\n|Mobility sessions per week|2-3 depending on track|\n\n\u2026\n\n## Methodology Behind Persist\n\nAt the core of the Persist training program, Marcus Filly and his team use principles of progressive overload to help you achieve muscle size and strength. Persist is a well thought-out program, it\u2019s not a kitchen sink workout randomly sprinkled with burpees.\n\n\u2026\n\nProgress isn\u2019t linear, and the Persit program from FBB addresses that head on. In all five tracks of the program, you will see nearly all of the principles of progressive overload show up, including load, repetitions, volume, rest period, range of motion, tempo, frequency, and degree of difficulty.\n\nIn a welcome video from Marcus Filly, he notes that there is a fine line between \u201cGetting a great training session and feeling like you didn\u2019t work hard enough.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\n## Persist Offers Five Different Tracks To Choose From\n\nThere are five different tracks to choose from within the Persist program. All programs run on 6-week training cycles that typically build on movements and skills from the previous cycle.\n\nIn an introduction video to the program, Marcus Filly encourages athletes to stay on one track during the cycle to get the most benefit from the programming and progression. I did toggle a bit between tracks, but I mainly used Pillars.\nHere is what to expect from each training track:\n\n**Pillars Track:**Four, 60-minute workouts per week, focusing on functional fitness and compound movements like squat, bench, deadlift, and overhead press (plus conditioning finishers like EMOMS, AMRAPS, and burnout sets) **Pump Condition Track:**Five, 75-minute muscle-building and hypertrophy-style sessions with conditioning added at the end of most workouts **Pump Lift Track:**Five, 75-minute hypertrophy-style sessions without conditioning **Perform Track** **:**Five, 90 minute sessions that includes Olympic lifts and other functional fitness **Minimalist** **Track:**Five, 60-minute",

          "snippet": "Based on the training Mat Fraser used in his years of competition, this program has evolved with the lessons he\u2019s learned since stepping off the floor. PRO is a progression-based system designed to develop athletes and prepare them for competition \u2014 whether you\u2019re chasing elite podiums or competing within your MASTERS division.\n\nTrack variations allow athletes to switch between OFF SEASON and COMP PREP phases to align with individual goals, while the MASTERS track provides a dedicated path tailored to the unique demands, timelines, and recovery needs of Masters athletes.\n\nAccess to a fully equipped gym and additional training facilities, such as a track and a pool, is required. Two sessions a day, each lasting 2\u20133 hours of training. High-volume programming for dedicated professionals, with NO MODIFYING or SCALING.\n\n**HWPO PRO | off season**\n\nFollow our primary track outside of competition prep to maintain and develop your elite fitness. If you need to focus on a specific weakness or have personal goals you want to achieve, our track variations are thoughtfully designed to get you where you want to be.\n\nThis is the primary year-round track and forms the basis for all development track variations of HWPO PRO.\n\nThoughtfully design progressions with no specific modality focus. This track allows for continual development without peaking for a specific competition. Follow this track if you don't plan to compete in the immediate future to gain exposure and focus on weaknesses until you're ready to switch to COMP PREP.\n\nOur TIME LIMITED track features reduced volume and session lengths, thoughtfully designed by our expert coaching team to ensure athletes still achieve the intended stimulus for each workout.\n\nThere are many reasons an athlete may benefit from a lower-volume approach. Whether due to body type, training age, or actual age, reducing volume can enhance recovery, minimize injury risk, and support long-term progress.\n\nThis track will follow the same progressions as HWPO PRO. However, it will see an increase in STRENGTH work, often involving a little more exposure to higher percentages and/or a higher volume of accessory work. In addition, conditioning will reduce to allow for more energy availability and recovery for/from the strength sessions.\n\nThis track will follow the same progressions as HWPO PRO with increased conditioning pieces. The coaching team will adjust the training order to allow for more energy availability in the conditioning sessions. This will target the athletes who generally struggle with the longer-time domain metcons at competitions. You can also expect a reduction in the intensity (drop in percentages) and volume of strength work to allow for the aerobic focus.\n\n**HWPO PRO | COMP PREP**\n\nWhen it's time to SHOW UP and COMPETE, we've got you. Switch from our standard OFF SEASON tracks when it's time to prepare, and you'll receive training tailored to get you competition-ready.\n\nTailored to the demands of your target event, ensuring you develop the strength, skill, and endurance required for success. The program progresses through key training phases, refining movement efficiency, dialing in competition pacing, and exposing you to event-style workouts.\n\nDesigned to maximize readiness while allowing for recovery. Training volume is adjusted, intensity is strategically maintained, and competition-specific elements, such as transitions, mental preparation, and game-day strategies are fine-tuned. This ensures you arrive at your competition in peak condition, physically primed and mentally confident.\n\n**HWPO PRO | Masters**\n\nPRO MASTERS is a dedicated track built specifically for competitive MASTERS athletes. It follows the official Masters competition season, blending the structure and intensity of PRO with smart programming that enhances recovery, protects longevity, and sustains peak performance.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a lighter version of PRO \u2014 it\u2019s refined for where you are in your career. Training volume and intensity are thoughtfully adjusted, joint prep and mobility are prioritized, and movement progressions are tailored for continued strength and skill advancement.\n\nColette Casey leads HWPO MASTERS with years of coaching experience across multiple age brackets. A 3rd-place finisher at the 2023 CrossFit Games (35\u201339), she brings firsthand competitive insight to every session.\n\n**HWPO PRO | ABOUT**\n\nHWPO PRO is a progression based program for serious HARD WORKERS chasing competitive performance. It includes three key elements: OFF SEASON, COMP PREP, and MASTERS.\n\nOFF SEASON builds the foundation, improving weaknesses, developing strength, and maintaining fitness between competition cycles. COMP PREP turns that work into game-day performance with higher intensity, structured progressions, and event-style sessions that replicate the demands of competition.\n\nMASTERS is a dedicated track that follows its own competition season, tailored specifically for Masters athletes. It mirrors the intent of PRO but with adjusted volume, recovery, and movement prep to support sustained performance, resilience, and longevity throughout the season.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to WORK HARD, so there\u2019s\n\n**no scaling or modifying** for the program or movements. HWPO PRO typically includes two sessions per day, each running 2\u20133 hours. Proficiency in barbell movements and high-skill gymnastics is required.\n\n**PRO: TIME LIMITED** offers a reduced volume of training for those who are restricted on time or respond better to lower volume.\n\n**PRO: MASTERS** follows a similar adjusted structure but is designed specifically for MASTERS athletes \u2014 balancing competitive performance with smarter recovery and sustainable progression across the season.\n\nAccess to a fully equipped gym is essential. For HWPO PRO, athletes will be expected to have out of gym sessions such as trail running, hill sprints, track sessions and swim workouts.\n\nYou can expect a variety of machine work on the rower, bike erg, ski erg and echo bike as well as the use of med balls, Dballs and sandbags. Additionally, barbells and plates, dumbbells, kettlebells and access to a rig will be required. Access to specialty equipment is also required such as axel bars, peg boards and various training implements such as a road bike.\n\n**HWPO PRO | ABOUT**\n\nAthletes must have the ability to train for two sessions per day, five days a week, with one recovery day and one FULL rest day. The \u2018Time Limited\u2019 variant of HWPO PRO will reduce overall training time over both sessions.\n\n**Note: **These times may fluctuate depending on your chosen focus.\n\n**HWPO PRO | ABOUT**\n\nMeet the HARDWORKING coaching staff dedicated to the HWPO PRO program. Our team brings their combined talents to help you achieve YOUR goals. They're dedicated to your progression and making sure you have everything you need to SHOW UP and WORK HARD.\n\nYes, access to a fully equipped gym is required. Access to additional training facilities such as a track and a pool is also required. You will be expected to have out of gym sessions such as trail running and hill sprints.\n\nHWPO PRO programming is broken down into two sessions a day. Each session is about 2-3 hours\n\nShort on time? We now offer a time-limited toggle available within the app.\n\nThis program is designed for advanced athletes aiming to make competing in sport a career. With the amount of volume provided in this program, it is not suggested to miss too many days nor is it suggested to \u201cmake up\u201d training days.\n\nIf you find you are not able to complete the training as prescribed due to life events please consider following another HWPO Training program that will allow for consistency and progress.\n\nYes, you can join HWPO PRO at any point. PRO is available year-round for development training. If you are preparing for a competition we recommend you get in when the prep track launches to be fully prepared.\n\nYes you can cancel your subscription at anytime. Monthly billing is automated.\n\nYou will receive 7 days of training at a time.\n\nPurchase your chosen program as usual (it\u2019s important you don\u2019t use your HSA/FSA card) and then submit your purchase via Truemed.

Hybrid athletes blend various training methods, building strength, endurance, and versatility to become highly fit and resilient. To learn more about hybrid training, check out our Comprehensive Hybrid Athlete Training Program, designed to help you master strength and endurance.\n\nNick Bare\u2019s athletic achievements are nothing short of extraordinary. He runs marathons, competes in triathlons, is a professional bodybuilder, and serves as a US Army infantry officer. Beyond his athletic prowess, Bare is a successful entrepreneur who founded a multi-million dollar nutrition and supplements company from scratch. He\u2019s also an acclaimed author and a leader in the fitness world, inspiring a growing community of athletes and enthusiasts through his educational YouTube content on health, fitness, and training.\n\n**This article dives into Nick Bare\u2019s workout routine and nutrition strategies, offering insights into the ultimate hybrid training program that spans multiple sports disciplines**.\n\n**Who Is Nick Bare?**\n\n|Full Name: Nick Bare|\n|--|\n|Weight|Height|Date of Birth|\n|(88.5-93.0 kg) 205-215 lbs|(182 cm) 6\u2019|08/01/1990|\n|Profession|Era|Nationality|\n|Hybrid Athlete, Fitness Coach, Nutritionist|2010s, 2020s|American|\nNick Bare is from Pennsylvania and later moved to Austin, Texas. He attended Indiana University of Pennsylvania and graduated with a degree in Nutrition in May 2013.\n\nHis road to fitness started in his early teens when he was recovering from an eating disorder that affected his health. To help with his recovery, Bare began hitting the gym and watching his diet.\n\n\u201cMy fitness journey started as a young teen, recovering from an eating disorder and transitioning my focus to a healthier and happier me.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Nick Bare\n\nHe went through recovery and learned much about eating right and resistance training. This served as motivation to overcome his eating disorder and be the healthiest version of himself.\n\nEventually, Bare overcame his eating disorder and became fit and healthy. His years of resistance training resulted in lean, well-sculpted, and strong muscles, which gave him all the confidence he needed.\n\nDuring college, Bare learned more about nutrition and studied it for his degree. He also joined the Army ROTC program and worked as an infantry officer after graduation. While in the Army, Bare graduated from three different schools: Air Assault School, Army Ranger School, and U.S. Airborne School. He also became the infantry platoon leader, working with the USA\u2019s finest soldiers and military officers.\n\nWhile in the Army, Nick Bare built his own company, Bare Performance Nutrition, because of his passion for fitness, nutrition, and health. He explained he was already preparing for life after four years with the army. \u201cDuring my entire time in the military, I was building my fitness company in preparation for my transition to civilian life after my 4-year contract,\u201d Bare said.\n\nWhen he was released at the end of his contract, he immediately opened a gym and focused on building the fitness company he started while in the Army. That company is now a well-known name in the fitness industry. Bare inspires others to be like him by sharing his experiences, further growing his brand and online presence. \u201cToday, I run my businesses out of the gym and share my life, business, and fitness journey on social media platforms,\u201d Bare stated.\n\nIn 2018, Nick Bare signed up for his first-ever marathon. After that experience, he learned how to balance endurance and strength training. He also signed up for triathlons like IronMan, 100-mile ultramarathons, and a bodybuilding competition. Through these experiences, he realized that specialization training wasn\u2019t an optimal approach but hybrid training.\n\n\u201cHybrid athlete training is the best way to train. The reason it\u2019s the best lies directly in the results. Improved body composition, longevity, and it\u2019s sustainable.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Nick Bare\n\n**Nick Bare\u2019s Workout Routine**\n\nNick Bare\u2019s workouts have changed over the years, but he commits to hitting every muscle group weekly through resistance training. He also considers cardiovascular conditioning a better part of his routine. This study shows cardiovascular exercises can improve heart rate, overall health, and quality of life (1).\n\nHe works out six days a week, doing cardio exercises in the morning and strength training in the evenings. When strength training, he uses the heaviest weights he can lift. Also, before he starts his training, he has a pre-workout shake. A study shows that pre-workouts before exercise can help delay fatigue and enhance exercise performance (2).\n\n**Leg Workout**\n\n|Exercises|Sets|Reps|\n|--|--|--|\n|Leg Extensions|4|12|\n|Hamstring Curls|4|10|\n|Back Squats|3|5|\n|Hack Squats|4|8|\n|Dumbbell Romanian Deadlifts|4|10|\n**Core Workout**\n\n|Exercises|Sets|Reps|\n|--|--|--|\n|Hanging Leg Raises|4|15-20|\n|Cable Crunches|4|15-20|\n|The Glute-Ham Developer Sit-Ups|4|15-20|\n|Obliques V-Ups|4|15 on each side|\n**Arms & Shoulders Workout**\n\n|Exercises|Sets|Reps|\n|--|--|--|\n|Push Ups|4|25|\n|Pull Ups|4|10|\n|Barbell Curls|4|8|\n|Triceps Pushdowns|4|12|\n|Preacher Curls|4|10|\n|Triceps Dips|4|10|\n|Hammer Curls|4|10|\n|Triceps Extensions|4|12|\n**Back Workout**\n\n|Exercises|Sets|Reps|\n|--|--|--|\n|Pull Ups|4|AMRAP|\n|Deadlifts|3|5|\n|Lat Pulldowns|4|8|\n|Pendlay Rows|4|12|\n|Low Rows|4|10|\n|Dumbbell Rows|4|10|\n**Chest Workout**\n\nBefore starting his chest workouts, he does three cardio sets using a Concept2 bike. He also does light resistance band stretches and performs internal and external rotations with a light dumbbell.\n\n|Exercises|Sets|Reps|\n|--|--|--|\n|Bench Presses|4|8|\n|Incline Dumbbell Presses|4|5|\n|Superset \u2014 Seated Cable Flys & Push Ups (60-90 seconds rest in between)|4|8|\n|4|AMRAP|\n|Bodyweight Dips|4|10|\n**Long Runs**\n\n\u201cI love doing my long runs on the weekends right when I wake up. It\u2018s like one of my favorite things to do.\u201d\n\n**Rest & Recovery**\n\nAfter an intense week of workouts, Nick Bare rests his muscles so they can recover in preparation for the following week.\n\n**Workout Notes**\n\nNick Bare structures his workouts into two sections daily. He does morning runs and strength training in the evening to work different muscle groups. Bare trains six days a week and uses the last day to rest and recovery.\n\nFor his resistance training, he typically does four sets with eight to twelve reps while using the heaviest weight he can lift. Before starting his major exercises, he does a lot of light weightlifting, and resistance band stretches to warm up and get his blood flowing.\n\n**Nutrition**\n\nNick Bare\u2019s approach to nutrition involves eating foods rich in protein, carbohydrates, healthy fats, and other essential nutrients. He also likes supplements, especially those that add essential nutrients to his diet. Some of his supplements include BCAAs, protein shakes, and pre-workouts.\n\nFollow Generation Iron on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter for more workout approaches!\n\n**References**\n\n- Nystoriak, M.

          "snippet": "For those leading the way in modern programming who know that\n\nbetter classes build better gyms.\n\n**We program for the best member experience possible**\n\nWorkouts should be doable but difficult for most. Programming for the top 10% of your athletes and scaling for the rest doesn't work. Your members want to follow the training as closely as prescribed each day, not two members out of twenty doing ring muscle-ups and the other 18 doing something completely different. By avoiding this, your class experience is more seamless and less disjointed.\n\nWhen most class members are doing the same class workout, the vibe is better, the community is stronger, and the consistency is greater. The result is increased fitness and a better business.\n\n**We program for a consistent weekly structure **\n\nWe balance a predictable rhythm to the schedule with variance in workouts.\n\nEvery week, your members will get:\n\nThis simple structure promotes clear, consistent progress for members but also keeps training enjoyable and engaging.\n\nIt helps each member build a sustainable routine, promoting growth and forging a strong community within your gym.\n\n**We program benchmark workouts every two weeks.**\n\nEvery year we repeat 24 workouts to make progress tracking easy for your members.\n\nThis visibility, consistency, and accountability will show them on a regular basis how they are improving over time.\n\nThrough routine testing and clear metrics, you'll create a gym community where progress is not just hoped for but expected and achieved.\n\n**We program to build strength, endurance, and capacity sustainably.**\n\nRather than focusing on building strength one month, endurance in another, and high-intensity capacity in the next, we build them together every week and all year round.\n\nIt ensures our training program moves you forward across all fitness domains, creating a well-rounded athlete ready for any challenge \u2014whether on the field, in the gym, or in the real world.\n\nYour members will love feeling stronger & getting fitter, slowly and sustainably.\n\n**We program for the functional movement patterns of an active life.**\n\nYour members want the ability to play, to compete, and to live at whatever speed they desire.\n\nWe believe in programming highly functional movements applicable across sports, outdoor adventures, and daily life. Most don't need or want sport-specific skills with narrow real-world utility.\n\nWe don't program complex gymnastic movements for this reason.\n\nThe reality of your member\u2019s lives demands strength, endurance, and capacity. It doesn't require them to know how to walk on their hands.\n\n**We program for members who want to train smart**\n\nYour members want to be your members forever. They don\u2019t want to get beat up and spit out. They don't want to keep searching. They want a training program they can do consistently, and that works.\n\nIntensity drives results, but when structured poorly and without intelligent controls around volume, it can become the barrier to progress instead of the main driver..\n\nWe implement what we call \u201cintentional intensity\u201d through movement pairings, loading, & rep shemes that fall into our programming sweet spot for sustainable power output.\n\nThis allows your coaches and therefore your members to maximize their training efficiency while preventing overtraining and ensuring sustainable progress.\n\nThe result: Your members will build up, not burn out.\n\n**We program running as a cornerstone. **\n\nTraveling efficiently from one point to another is as functional as it gets.

That\u2019s because the Coach uses periodized training to create your customized training plan.\n\nThe idea of a periodized training program is that each phase of your training is built upon the other by focusing on either intensity (fewer reps, higher weights, faster pace) or volume (i.e., more reps, lighter weights, longer duration, more mileage) so you can build conditioning, athleticism, and strength throughout your body.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Intervals & HIIT workouts\n\nEach Coach Day has a specific focus that includes either interval-type workouts, with rounds of exercises and rest periods in between, or HIIT workouts, which involve intense bursts of activity followed by varying recovery times (Hello, God workouts). These are all done at your own pace, designed to make you faster and stronger while unlocking new exercises and skills.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe Freeletics Coach adapts each training session as you go with a 90% accuracy after week one, and this can only happen if the feedback you provide is also accurate.\n\nUsing this input along with other factors like your age, gender, and fitness level, the Coach\u2019s algorithm crafts personalized recommendations for exercises, reps, and sets \u2013 in other words, creates your Coach session.",

His approach counters the common misconception that\nmore training always leads to better performance.

Scientific Evidence Supporting 8020 Running Multiple studies support the efficacy of polarized training models like 80/20: -\n\n\u2026\n\n80/20 rule provides a framework, individual variation is important. Runners should monitor fatigue, soreness, and performance to adjust\ntraining intensity as needed. Practical Application of the 8020 Running Model Designing Your Weekly Training Plan To implement 8020\nrunning, consider the following structure: Sample Weekly Breakdown: | Day | Workout Type | Intensity | Duration/Distance | |-------|-----\n\n\u2026\n\nFocus on establishing the 80/20 ratio. - Month 2: Slightly increase volume of easy runs or add more challenging workouts. - Month 3:\nIncorporate race-specific efforts or longer tempo runs. - Ongoing: Regularly evaluate and adapt your plan to sustain progress and prevent\nburnout. Case Studies and Success Stories Numerous amateur and elite runners have adopted Fitzgerald\u2019s 8020 running principles with\n\n\u2026\n\nthe importance of balancing training intensity with recovery. Rooted in the widely recognized 80/20 principle, Fitzgerald\u2019s methodology\nadvocates for dedicating approximately 80% of training time to low-intensity running and the remaining 20% to higher-intensity efforts. This\nstrategic distribution aims to optimize endurance, prevent burnout, and accelerate performance gains, making it a transformative concept\n\n\u2026\n\nWeekly Training Breakdown Implementing the 80/20 principle requires careful planning.

Even the best training plan won\u2019t help you much if you don\u2019t understand it. This article offers guidelines and tips to help you get the most out of the 80/20 Run plans.\n\n## Anatomy of a Workout\n\nEach workout has three basic elements. The first two are duration/distance (how long the workout is) and intensity (how fast the workout is). The third is structure, which is how the workout is divided into segments of various lengths and intensities. The workout descriptions you see in the training schedules provide information about duration/distance, intensity, and structure in a condensed format.\n\nLet\u2019s look at one example:\n\nCritical Velocity Intervals Run\n\n5:00 in Zone 1\n\n10:00 in Zone 2\n\n5 x 4:00 @ CV/2:00 in Zone 1\n\n15:00 in Zone 1\n\nWe chose this example because it has a fairly complex structure. Nevertheless, it\u2019s not at all difficult to decode and follow. The workout has three segments: a warm-up, an interval set, and a cool-down.\n\n\u201c5:00 in Zone 1, 10:00 in Zone 2\u201d is the warm-up segment. You\u2019ll execute this part by jogging easily for 5 minutes at Zone 1 intensity and then running for 10 minutes at Zone 2 intensity.\n\n\u201c5 x (4:00 @ CV/2:00 in Zone 1)\u201d is the interval segment. What these instructions are telling you to do is run for 4 minutes at CV, which, as the pre-activity comments area of this workout explains, stands for Critical Velocity, or the fastest pace you could sustain for 30 minutes, equal to the low end of Zone 4. You then slow down and jog for 2 minutes in Zone 1, and repeat this sequence a total of five times.\n\n\u201c15:00 in Zone 1\u201d is the cool-down segment.\n\nYou\u2019ll execute this by jogging easily for 15 minutes at Zone 1 intensity. There is an almost infinite variety of workout structures, but if you understand how to interpret and apply the example we just covered, you can do the same with any other workout.\n\nNote that you have the flexibility to perform the workout at any point within the zone. For example, if the workout segment calls for Zone 1, and your Zone 1 heart rate is 115 to 129 bpm, you can perform the segment anywhere within that range. Continually performing workout segments at the upper end of a zone does not always lead to superior results. Sometimes appropriate recovery requires performing Zone 1 and 2 segments at the low end of the range. It is also best to perform moderate and high intervals\n\n*consistently* rather than *intensely*. Performing a set of 5 intervals at mid-Zone 3 is preferable to performing each of 5 intervals at a different point in Zone 3. Only when you are well-recovered and can perform intervals consistently is it recommended to execute the segment at the high end of the zone.\n\n## Getting to Know Your Zones\n\nPerhaps the trickiest part of executing the workouts that are prescribed in a training plan is running at the right intensity in each segment. You will find complete guidelines for using our seven-zone intensity scale in our Intensity Guidelines. But simply reading these guidelines alone won\u2019t enable you to fully master the skill of running in the right zones. A certain amount of experience is also required.\n\nDon\u2019t worry: It doesn\u2019t take long to develop a feel for the various zones, so that, for example, when you start a 3-minute interval in Zone 3, you are able to settle into the right effort level even before your device confirms that you\u2019re in the correct zone. Here are some specific tips for mastering each individual zone:\n\n**Zone 1**\n\nZone 1 is a very low intensity. Staying within it usually requires that you actively hold yourself back to a pace that\u2019s slower than your natural running pace. The common exception is when a Zone 1 recovery jog follows a tiring high-intensity effort. The important thing to understand is that it\u2019s almost impossible to go too slow when you\u2019re aiming for Zone 1, whereas it\u2019s very easy and all too common to go too fast.\n\n**Zone 2**\n\nZone 2 is fairly broad. You might wonder, \u201cWhere exactly within this zone should I be?\u201d As a general rule, we encourage runners to go by feel. If you feel strong, run near the top end of Zone 2. If you feel tired or sluggish, go ahead and allow yourself to run near the bottom end.\n\n**Zone X**\n\nZone X is given a letter name instead of a numerical name because it is generally avoided in training. It\u2019s more of a gap between Zones 2 and 3 than a zone unto itself. Zone X represents the \u201cmoderate-intensity rut\u201d that most runners get stuck in without realizing it before they adopt the 80/20 method and learn to slow down in their easy runs and long runs. However, Zone X does overlap with race intensity for many runners at the half-marathon and marathon distance. For this reason, many of our 80/20 Run plans include Steady State Runs, Half-Marathon Pace Runs, and/or Marathon Pace Runs that target Zone X. This zone is also targeted briefly in some Fartlek Runs and Progression Runs.\n\n**Zone 3**\n\nZone 3 corresponds to lactate threshold intensity. Thinking in \u201cthreshold\u201d terms can help you find this zone and stay in it by feel. The feeling of running in Zone 3 is often described as \u201ccomfortably hard,\u201d or as the fastest speed that still feels relaxed. When you perform a Zone 3 effort, imagine there\u2019s a cliff edge in front of you that represents the feeling of strain that accompanies faster speeds. Always stay one or two steps back from this precipice when training in Zone 3.\n\n**Zone Y**\n\nLike Zone X, Zone Y is more of a gap between zones than a one unto itself. It\u2019s a little too fast for threshold workouts, which target Zone 3, and a little too slow for high-intensity interval workouts, which offer more fitness bang for your workout buck when done in Zones 4 and 5.\n\n**Zone 4**\n\nMastering this zone is a matter of connecting the pace, power, and/or heart rate numbers that define the zone with what it feels like to run at that pace, power, or heart rate, so that you are able to reliably start each Zone 4 effort at the right intensity. If you mess it up the first few times, either going too slow or too fast, don\u2019t sweat it. In fact, getting it wrong today is the best way to get it right tomorrow.\n\n**Zone 5**\n\nZone 5 is almost always used in interval workouts, including Hill Repetitions Runs. This intensity zone ranges from the highest speed you can sustain for a few minutes all the way to a full sprint. So how fast should you actually run Zone 5 efforts? Tailor your pace to the specific format of the workout. The rule of thumb here is to run closer to the bottom end of Zone 5 when these efforts are longer and closer to the top end when the intervals are shorter. For example, if a workout asks you to run a bunch of 1-minute intervals in Zone 5, you\u2019ll want to control your pace so that you are able to run all of the intervals at the same speed without slowing down. But if a workout prescribes a set of 20-second intervals, you\u2019ll want to run them as relaxed sprints.\n\nWhen using heart rate to measure intensity, you\u2019ll soon discover that your BMP takes 1 to 2 minutes to \u201ccatch up.\u201d As a result, you\u2019ll often not reach the heart rate target during very brief Zone 4 or 5 intervals. Pace and Power are more reliable methods to measure those high intensities. If you prefer to train by heart rate, you can mitigate this lag issue by using the 80/20 Run and Bike Zones Garmin App, which allows you to have real-time HR and your custom 80/20 pace or power zones displayed on your device at the same time.\n\n**Why Zones X and Y?**\n\nYou may wonder why a seven-zone intensity scale such as ours tops out at Zone 5. The reason is that in the original version of the scale, Zone X and Zone Y were not explicitly named. Instead these zones existed only as gaps between Zones 2 and 3 and between Zones 3 and 4, respectively. The first gap was created to ensure that low-intensity exercise efforts did not accidentally bleed into moderate intensity and the second to encourage athletes to commit to either moderate or high intensity. Nevertheless, many athletes found the gaps confusing, so we modified the 80/20 intensity scale in a manner that eliminates gaps and the confusion they cause while preserving the distinction between untargeted zones (X and Y) and targeted zones (1-5).\n\n## Cross-training\n\nAlthough there are no formally scheduled cross-training sessions in the runs plans, you have a standing option to replace any Recovery Run or Foundation Run with a nonimpact cardio alternative of equal duration and intensity. You will see periodic reminders of this sprinkled throughout each plan.\n\nSo, when should you cross-train and when should you run? There are two competing, but equally valid, truths to consider when deciding whether to run or to cross-train. On the one hand, the more you run, the more you\u2019ll improve as a runner. The principle of specificity teaches us that if you run instead of cross-training each time you see a Recovery Run or Foundation run on your schedule, your running performance will increase more than if you do the opposite. On the other hand, above a certain level, the more you run, the more likely it is that you will develop an impact-related overuse injury such as runner\u2019s knee. So, if you\u2019re injury prone or concerned about injury, you may be better off doing some or all of your Recovery Runs and Foundation Runs in a nonimpact cardio exercise modality such as bicycling.\n\nThere are two basic approaches to replacing runs with cross-training: the programmatic approach and the as-needed approach. In the programmatic approach, you replace certain runs with cross-training sessions routinely. For example, you might replace your first Foundation Run of each week with an elliptical workout. In the as-needed approach, you replace runs with cross-training only when soreness or fatigue from prior running makes running again seem inadvisable. Note that these two approaches are not mutually exclusive, and indeed you should cross-train instead of running anytime it seems risky to run, regardless of whether you also practice the programmatic approach. Finding the right balance for you may require some trial and error (See the section\n\n*The Importance of Listening to Your Body* below).\n\nThe best cross-training activities are those that are most similar to running without the impact element. Pool running, antigravity treadmill running, indoor and outdoor cycling, elliptical running, outdoor elliptical biking, steep uphill treadmill walking, indoor and outdoor cross-country skiing, inline skating, and steep uphill treadmill walking have all been used successfully. Strength training is a completely different sort of cross-training that we strongly recommend but as a complement to aerobic cross-training rather than a substitute for it. See Incorporating Strength Training to Your Plan for ideas on how to incorporate strength training into your plan.\n\nNote that effective 80/20 training requires that you spend 80 percent of your combined aerobic training, encompassing running and cross-training, at low intensity. In the case of our 80/20 Run plans, this means all of your cross-training sessions need to be done in Zones 1 and 2.\n\n## Perfection is Overrated\n\nWhile it\u2019s important to execute workouts as they were intended to be done, it is not necessary that you execute every perfectly, and you shouldn\u2019t beat yourself up when a given is not done to the letter. If the 10-mile run on your schedule for today ends up being a 9.9-mile, no big deal.\n\nThere\u2019s a well-known story about a legendary running coach who always had his athletes run 187-meter hill repetitions. Another coach who admired this legendary coach emailed him to inquire about this very precise distance. \u201cWhy 187 meters?\u201d he asked, assuming there must be some deep physiological rationale for it. But the legendary coach came back with this answer, \u201cWhy 187 meters? Because that\u2019s how long the hill closest to our training camp is.\u201d\n\nKeep this story in mind as you can execute your 80/20 Run plans. As with horseshoes and hand grenades, close is good enough.\n\n## The Importance of Listening to Your Body\n\nThere are some times when executing the workouts in your training plan to the very letter is a\n\n*bad* idea. For example, if you get three intervals into a nine-interval workout and you feel absolutely terrible, you should probably stop, or replace the remaining intervals with an easy jog. (A helpful guideline to follow is this: If your pace for a given interval is more than 3% slower than it was in the previous interval, terminate the interval set and complete the remaining time in Zone 1 or 2.) Similarly, if you wake up one morning with a really sore foot that hurts even to walk on, you should not run that day.\n\nA training plan is really an attempt to predict the future. The many workouts that comprise a training plan represent what you should do if everything goes perfectly-that is, if there are no days when you feel really lousy or have an alarming sore spot. But things seldom go perfectly all the way through a training program. It\u2019s important that you listen to your body at every step of the process and make adjustments as necessary based on what your body is telling you.\n\n## Glossary of Workout Codes\n\n|Code|sport|Name|Description|\n|--|--|--|--|\n|CA|Cycling|Accelerations Ride|Developed originally as a run workout by influential French exercise physiologist Veronique Billat, Accelerations Rides combine the unique physical challenge of riding at every intensity between a cruise and a full sprint with a unique and valuable pacing challenge. Correct execution of the two accelerations in this workout entails accelerating continuously and gradually from Zone 2 to the top of Zone 5. The most common mistake is speeding up too quickly and thus running out of \"gears\" before the end, so guard against this.|\n|CCP|Cycling|Critical Power Ride|Critical Power Rides feature longer intervals at an intensity that walks the line between moderate and high. They are designed to enable athletes to maintain a stable metabolic state at higher intensities. Critical Power (CP) is the highest intensity a cyclist can sustain for 30 minutes, which for most falls at the low end of Zone 4. Try to maintain a steady level of output from the start of the first CP interval to the end of the last interval in this and other Critical Power Rides. Also pay attention to your output in the Zone 1 recovery segments. If you find yourself slowing down in these recoveries as the workout progresses, you might be going too hard in the CP segments.|\n|CDI|Cycling|Descending Intervals Ride|Developed by scientists at the University of Udine in Italy, Descending Intervals are proven to increase the amount of time an athlete is able to spend above 90% of VO2max intensity within a single session. This makes the workout a potent way to boost aerobic capacity (aka VO2max). The heart of the workout is a set of five efforts of decreasing length that target Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), which is the highest output a cyclist can sustain for about 6 minutes and falls at the low end of Zone 5. Each MAP effort is followed by a Zone 1 active recovery that's two-thirds the duration of the preceding effort. Athletes have a natural tendency to adjust their effort to the duration of a segment, automatically doing shorter segments at a higher effort level than longer ones. In Descending Intervals Rides like this one, though, you should do each Zone 5 segment at the same effort level even though they get shorter.|\n|CSP|Cycling|Speed Play Ride|Speed Play Rides are essentially casual interval rides. They serve to deliver modest doses of high-intensity cycling and fit well in base training, recovery weeks, and pre-race taper periods. This particular Speed Play Ride hits every zone from 1 to 4. Frequent speed changes make it fun but also challenging to pace. Do the best you can to nail each segment and trust that you'll get better with practice. Note that the recovery segments between faster efforts in this Speed Play Ride target Zone 2 rather than Zone 1, as in standard interval workouts. In other words, the \"easy\" parts aren't quite as easy, which contributes to the fitness-boosting effect of the ride.|\n|CSS|Cycling|Steady State Ride|Steady State Rides target Zone X, a zone that is generally avoided in the 80/20 system but is good to spend SOME time in, as doing so builds a bridge between extensive endurance (the ability to ride far) and intensive endurance (the ability to ride fast without fatiguing). The Zone X segment in this ride should be completed at an effort you feel you could sustain for 2 hours, which falls somewhere between Olympic-distance and half-iron race effort for most athletes.|\n|CVI|Cycling|Variable-Intensity Intervals Ride|Variable-Intensity Interval Rides feature an unusual two-step interval format that is proven to enable athletes to spend more time at or near VO2max intensity than they do in traditional, single-pace intervals. The result is bigger gains in aerobic capacity/VO2max. The first 30 seconds of each Variable-Intensity Interval are done at Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), which is the highest output you could sustain for about 6 minutes, and the next 45 seconds are run at Functional Threshold Power (FTP), which aligns with the top end of Zone 3. These two steps are repeated four times before you dial back to Zone 1 to recover. Variable-Intensity Intervals are almost as challenging mentally as they are physically. Effective execution does not require that you complete each and every segment at just the right intensity, but it does require that you make your best effort to do so, and this effort demands steady focus.|\n|LIC|Cycling|Lactate Intervals Ride|Lactate Intervals Rides are designed to boost aerobic capacity (aka VO2max), which is the most important physiological underpinning of cycling performance. This particular format was developed by exercise scientists at Inland Norway University as a way to increase the amount of time an athlete is able to spend near VO2max intensity within a single session without becoming exhausted. Lactate Intervals target Zone 4, which is fairly broad. You'll get the most benefit if you aim for an effort you could sustain for 15 minutes in race conditions, which will put you close to the middle of the zone. Because both the intervals and the recoveries are so short in this workout, pacing can be tricky. Don't worry--you'll get the hang of it as you go.|\n|OUC|Cycling|Over/Under Intervals Ride|Over/Under Intervals Rides feature intervals in which the intensity fluctuates between slightly above and slightly below the lactate threshold (LT). The harder segments target Zone Y, which occupies the small space between Zone 3 and Zone 4, while the easier segments target Zone 3, whose upper limit aligns with LT. Like Tempo Rides and other workouts that directly target LT, Over/Under Intervals develop the ability to ride relaxed and efficiently at moderate intensity, but their variable-intensity format offers the additional benefit of teaching the body to recover from a harder effort while still riding somewhat aggressively. In doing this or any Over/Under Intervals Ride, focus on oscillating gently around the high end of Zone 3, going from just below it in the Zone 3 segments to just above it in the Zone Y segments.|\n|ER|Running|Endurance Run|As their name suggests, Endurance Runs serve to develop the basic physiological and psychological ingredients of endurance, including fat-burning capacity and mental focus. Whether you use pace, heart rate, or power as your primary intensity metric, you should always regulate your Endurance Runs by perceived effort as well, in such a way that you COULD speed up slightly at the end of the run if you chose to. Note that heart rate tends to rise over the course of an Endurance Run and may exceed Zone 2 toward the end even if you maintain a steady pace. This phenomenon, known as cardiac drift, is caused by fatigue-related efficiency loss and dehydration. When it happens, you do NOT need to slow down to lower your heart rate unless your pace or power is also above the Zone 2 range.|\n|LIR|Running|Lactate Intervals Run|Lactate Intervals Runs are designed to boost aerobic capacity (aka VO2max), which is the most important physiological underpinning of running performance. This particular format was developed by exercise scientists at Inland Norway University as a way to increase the amount of time an athlete is able to spend near VO2max intensity within a single session without becoming exhausted. Lactate Intervals target Zone 4, which is fairly broad. You'll get the most benefit if you aim for a pace you could sustain for 15 minutes in race conditions, which will put you close to the middle of the zone. Because both the intervals and the recoveries are so short in this workout, pacing can be tricky. Don't worry--you'll get the hang of it as you go.|\n|OUR|Running|Over/Under Intervals Run|Over/Under Intervals Runs feature intervals in which the intensity fluctuates between slightly above and slightly below the lactate threshold (LT). The harder segments target Zone Y, which occupies the small space between Zone 3 and Zone 4, while the easier segments target Zone 3, whose upper limit aligns with LT. Like Tempo Runs and other runs that directly target LT, Over/Under Intervals develop the ability to run relaxed and efficiently at moderate speeds, but their variable-pace format offers the additional benefit of teaching the body to recover from a harder effort while still running somewhat aggressively. In doing this or any Over/Under Intervals Run, focus on oscillating gently around the high end of Zone 3, going from just below it in the Zone 3 segments to just above it in the Zone Y segments.|\n|R5K|Running|5K Pace Intervals Run|5K Pace Intervals offer essential practice at race pace during 5K training but are also a useful fitness builder in training for shorter and longer events. Although the 5K pace (5KP) intervals in this workout target Zone 4, your 5KP may fall outside this zone, so do your best to complete the intervals at a pace you could sustain for 5K in race conditions regardless of zone. Unlike most 80/20 workouts, this one is distance-based rather than time-based because its job is to give runners of all ability levels equal preparation for the 5K race distance. Any time associated with this session is a broad estimate. Note that the 0.1 km Zone 1 segment following each 5KP segment is actually intended as passive rest, so just walk for 100 meters.|\n|R10K|Running|10K Pace Intervals Run|10K Pace Intervals offer essential practice at race pace during 10K training but are also a useful fitness builder in training for shorter and longer events. Although the 10K pace (10KP) intervals in this workout target Zone 4, your 10KP may fall outside this zone, so do your best to complete the intervals at a pace you could sustain for 10K in race conditions regardless of zone. Unlike most 80/20 workouts, this one is distance-based rather than time-based because its job is to give runners of all ability levels equal preparation for the 10K race distance. Any time associated with this session is a broad estimate. Note that the 0.1 km Zone 1 segment following each 10KP segment is actually intended as passive rest, so just walk for 100 meters.|\n|RA|Running|Accelerations Run|Developed by influential French exercise physiologist Veronique Billat, Accelerations Runs combine the unique physical challenge of running at every pace between a jog and a full sprint with a unique and valuable pacing challenge. Correct execution of the two accelerations in this workout entails accelerating continuously and gradually from Zone 2 to the top of Zone 5. The most common mistake is speeding up too quickly and thus running out of \"gears\" before the end, so guard against this. Because each acceleration culminates in an all-out effort, you'll need to walk a but before you resume running.|\n|RCV|Running|Critical Velocity Run|Critical Velocity Runs feature longer intervals at an intensity that rides the line between moderate and high. They are designed to enable runners to maintain a stable metabolic state at faster paces. Critical Velocity (CV) is the fastest pace a runner can sustain for 30 minutes, which for most falls at the low end of Zone 4. CV is also slower than 5K race pace and faster than 10K race pace for most runners. Try to maintain a steady pace from the start of the first CV interval to the end of the last interval in this and other Critical Velocity Runs. Also pay attention to your pace in the Zone 1 recovery segments. If you find yourself slowing down in these as the workout progresses, you may be running the CV segments too fast.|\n|RD|Running|Depletion Run|A Depletion Run is essentially an Endurance Run that is performed in a calorie-restricted state. Do this run on an empty stomach and consume only water and electrolytes during it--no calories. Depriving your muscles of calories before and during a longer run, as Depletion Runs like this one require, offers two proven benefits. The best-known benefit is improvement in the ability of the muscles to burn fat during running. But Depletion Runs have also been shown to increase aerobic capacity (aka VO2max) more than regular long runs. Because Depletion Runs are meant to be done on an empty stomach, it's generally most convenient to do them first thing in the morning before breakfast.|\n|RDI|Running|Descending Intervals Run|Developed by scientists at the University of Udine in Italy, Descending Intervals are proven to increase the amount of time an athlete is able to spend above 90% of VO2max intensity within a single session. This makes the workout a potent way to boost aerobic capacity (aka VO2max). The heart of the workout is a set of five efforts of decreasing length that target Maximal Aerobic Speed (MAS), which is the fastest pace a runner can sustain for about 6 minutes and falls at the high end of Zone 4. Each MAS effort is followed by a Zone 1 active recovery that's two-thirds the duration of the preceding effort. Runners have a natural tendency to adjust their effort to the duration of a segment, automatically running shorter segments faster than longer ones. In Descending Intervals Runs like this one, though, you should run each Zone 4 segment at the same speed even though they get shorter.|\n|RFR|Running|Fartlek Run|Fartlek Runs are essentially casual interval runs. Designed to deliver modest doses of faster running, they fit well in base training, recovery weeks, and pre-race taper periods. \"Fartlek\" means \"Speed Play\" in Swedish. Bring a playful mindset to this run by relying more on perceived effort than on pace, heart rate, or power to regulate your effort level during the faster segments. Note that the recovery segments in this Fartlek Run target Zone 2 rather than Zone 1, as in most interval sessions. In other words, the \"easy\" parts aren't quite as easy, which contributes to the fitness-boosting effect of the run.|\n|RHM|Running|Half-Marathon Pace Run|Half-Marathon Pace Runs offer essential practice at race pace during half-marathon training, but are also a useful fitness builder in training for shorter and longer events. Although the half-marathon pace (HMP) segments in this run target Zone 3, your HMP may fall outside this range, so do your best to complete the segments at a pace you could sustain for a half marathon in race conditions regardless of zone. Unlike most 80/20 workouts, this one is distance-based rather than time-based because its job is to give runners of all ability levels equal preparation for the half-marathon race distance. Any time associated with this session is a broad estimate. Note that the 0.1 km Zone 1 segment following each HMP segment is actually intended as passive rest, so just walk for 100 meters.|\n|RL|Running|Long Run|Long Runs are intended to develop the endurance required to \"go the distance\" on race day. For this reason they are always distance-based. Any time associated with this session is a broad estimate. Whether you use pace, heart rate, or power as your primary intensity metric, you should always regulate your Long Runs by rate of perceived effort as well, distributing your energy in such a way that you COULD speed up slightly at the end of the run if you chose to. Note that heart rate tends to rise over the course of a Long Run and may exceed Zone 2 toward the end even if your pace is steady. This phenomenon, known as cardiac drift, is caused by fatigue-related efficiency loss and dehydration. When it happens, you do NOT need to slow down in order to lower your heart rate unless your pace or power is also above the Zone 2 range.|\n|RLS|Running|Speed Intervals Run|Speed Intervals Runs will not make you a faster sprinter, but they will improve your running economy and your ability to resist fatigue at faster speeds. Studies have shown that even ultrarunners benefit from including some speed intervals in their training. Speed Intervals are necessarily quite short. For this reason, you'll need to rely mainly in perceived effort to regulate your effort. Specifically, aim for a 9-out-of effort for the workout as a whole. It's a good idea to include some form drills in your warm-up before doing Speed Intervals. These will help you perform better and reduce the risk of muscle/tendon strains. Here are links to some suggested drills: A Skips B Skips High Knees Butt Kicks|\n|RMP|Running|Marathon Pace Run|Marathon Pace Runs are intended to help runners become more efficient and comfortable at marathon pace (MP). They can also be used outside of marathon training to provide an endurance stimulus that's more challenging than a standard long run. Complete the Marathon Pace segments of this run at a speed you could sustain for a full marathon in race conditions. If you're not sure what this is, just do your best and focus on using the run to get a clearer sense of your current marathon pace. Note that Marathon Pace Runs are always distance-based. Any time associated with this session is a broad estimate.|\n|RP|Running|Progression Run|Similar to Fast Finish Runs, Progression Runs teach the body to run faster on tired legs. This particular run features a three-step progression that hits three moderate to high intensities: Lactate Threshold Pace, Critical Velocity, and Maximal Aerobic Speed. Be careful to avoid speeding up too early in anticipation of the progression part of this Progression Run. Stay in Zone 2 until your device cues you to accelerate. The three moderate to high intensities targeted at the end of this Progression Run are not far apart from each other pace-wise. For this reason, you may find it challenging initially to hit each one individually without overshooting. That's okay; you'll get better with repetition.|\n|RPI|Running|Progression Intervals Run|This workout format was developed by scientists at the University of Copenhagen in the 2010's and found to improve race performance in trained recreational runners. It features 1-minute intervals in which the first 30 seconds are completed in Zone 3, the next 20 seconds in Zone 4, and the last 10 second in Zone 5. You then go straight back to the top and complete the same sequence four times more for a total of five repetitions before easing down to Zone 1 for recovery. Because they hit a variety of intensities without focusing on any single intensity, Progression Intervals work well as a general fitness developer during base building and as a fitness maintainer during recovery weeks and taper periods. Progression Intervals can be challenging to pace correctly because they require you to \"shift gears\" frequently. But it's a fun challenge if you embrace it, and you will get better with practice.|\n|RSS|Running|Steady State Run|Steady State Runs target Zone X, a zone that is generally avoided in the 80/20 system but is good to spend SOME time in, as doing so builds a bridge between extensive endurance (the ability to run far) and intensive endurance (the ability to run fast without fatiguing). The Zone X segment in this run should be completed at a pace you feel you could sustain for 2 hours, a number that falls between half-marathon and marathon pace for most runners.|\n|RTT|Running|Relaxed Time Trial|A Relaxed Time Trial is a time trial that is run at 95% of race effort. These workouts serve to enhance goal-specific fitness and build confidence. To execute this workout, simply add 5% to your 5K race goal time, calculate the corresponding pace, and complete the Relaxed Time Trial segment of the workout at that pace. For example, if your goal time is 20:00 (4:00/km), run the Relaxed Time Trial segment at 4:12/km.|\n|RVI|Running|Variable-Intensity Intervals Run|Variable-Intensity Interval Runs feature an unusual two-step interval format that is proven to enable athletes to spend more time at or near VO2max intensity than they do in traditional, single-pace intervals. The result is bigger gains in aerobic capacity/VO2max. The first 30 seconds of each Variable-Intensity Interval are run at Maximal Aerobic Speed (MAS), which is the fastest pace you could sustain for about 6 minutes, and the next 45 seconds are run at Lactate Threshold Pace, which aligns with the top end of Zone 3. These two steps are repeated four times before you dial back to Zone 1 to recover. Variable-Intensity Intervals are almost as challenging mentally as they are physically. Effective execution does not require that you run each and every segment at just the right intensity, but it does require that you make your best effort to do so, and this effort demands steady focus.|\n\"During my first 12-week base period on an 80/20 plan I cut more time off more disciplines than I did in a year of Ironman training with one-on-one coaching. I\u2019ve also boosted my bike FTP by 20 watts. It\u2019s unreal.\"\n\n\"The results were amazing. I shed 27 minutes out of my 70.3 personal best and felt so strong and confident during the race that at times I thought the pace and time my watch was showing me was wrong!\"\n\n\"Only in my dreams did I dare to aim for 10:45 but the result was so much better: 10:34! No injuries were recorded during the whole preparation period.\"\n\n\"Over the past 16 weeks on an 80/20 plan I have improved my fastest kilometer by almost a minute, my 5k went from 38:50 to 30:28, and I ran 10 km, 21 km and 30 km for the first time ever. Oh, and I lost 22 kg in the process!\"\n\n\"My mom lost about 40 pounds, learned how to eat and exercise, and completed her first tri. I did my first Ironman on the 80/20 system. She continues to run and swim 4-5 days a week and honestly lives an entirely different life.\"\n\n\"The 80/20 plan was a joy and a relief. I now enjoy running more, run more with friends, and am creeping up to faster and faster speeds without injuries.\"\n\n\"The almost-daily runs and training consistently with the established intensity were key. I had no injuries while training!\"\n\n\"Using the 80/20 system, I ran a half marathon in 1:25, and followed up the performance with a Boston-qualifying 3:08 marathon at age 45!\"\n\n\"At 46, I broke my 5K record from when I was 33 and qualified for Boston using the 80/20 method.\"\n\n\"Trust it. This program relies on the time-tested methods of consistency and incremental gain. I am looking forward new PBs, even at 50 years old!\"\n\n\"I could not be happier. Finally, the work paid off and it was enjoyable!\"\n\n\"My expectations were exceeded. My fitness level is higher than it has been in two years, and has come at no cost to my body in regards of injury.\"\n\n\"I don't think I would have considered training for a marathon without the success I had with 80/20 training.\"\n\n\"I searched for answers and discovered the 80/20 way. Trust the process and stick to the plan!\"\n\n\"This is my 8th or 9th year of triathlon. I'm 10 weeks into the 80/20 training and I don't think I have ever been so strong.\"\n\n\"80/20 helped me go from running 3kms to 21kms and bike from 40kms to 90+kms without any injuries. I am a believer of 80/20 and have referred many of my friends. Thank you!\"\n\n\"The training is less demanding and less tiring, and the result exceeds my expectations.\"\n\n\"I honestly can't rate these plans high enough. Being able to wake up knowing what I've got planned for the day is comforting, but knowing it is working and making a difference is priceless.\"\n\n\"A training system which led me to achieve my ambitious goals. I am so glad that I trusted 80/20 and the plan. \"\n\n\"I went into my race knowing I was fitter and healthier than I have ever been.\"\n\n\"Having 8020 provide the structure took the anxiety out of my training and knowing whether I was doing the right things!\"\n\n\"I never thought I could beat my personal best Marathon time of 3:09, but with the 80/20 I ran a 2:57! My last kilometer was my fastest and I could have gone another 10K at that pace!\"\n\n\"80/20 Endurance dropped my threshold pace by 2 minutes per mile!\"\n\n\"The injuries all but disappeared!\"\n\n\"The best thing is that, throughout the training plan, I always felt great. I was never injured and enjoyed the experience.\"\n\n\"80/20 is a huge underlying principle of what I do week-in, week-out.\"\n\n\"I'm making a lot of progress due to the increased volume I'm able to do by just slowing down. I'm also feeling more rested for the tough workouts and really appreciating the recovery workouts in between.\"\n\n\"The results so far have been an increase in fitness and performance. I can run much farther at a constant pace than I have ever been able to before I also know so much more about my body and limits.\"\n\n\"Thank you for the role 80/20 played in getting to the finish line of Ironman Arizona. Going top 10% for my age group feels really great. Thanks for helping me conquer this life goal!\"\n\n\"After following the 80/20 plan I was able to break a personal best record. I not only finished within the goal I had set but did negative splits the entire race, which was a first for me.\"\n\n\"I\u2019ve never felt more energized in a training cycle. I\u2019m really able to balance my training load and my workload without burning out.\"\n\n\"Thank you 80/20 Endurance! I followed the plan and ran a half marathon as a \"feeler.\" I ran a 1:26, won my age group and was amazed that I could run that pace. Using 80/20, I went back to a marathon course where I ran a 3:23 on and ended up running a 3:13! I'm now qualified for the Boston Marathon!\"\n\n\"I honestly believe that there is no way I could've completed my first Ironman 70.3 were it not for the 80/20 training plan.\"\n\n\"I used the 80/20 plan to prepare for my first triathlon, which was also an Ironman 70.3. I was worried about injuries, available time, and being in shape to go the distance. All this worry for no reason, as the plan worked me up to the correct endurance levels without too many stresses on my aging body, and my plan did not overtake my life.\"\n\n\"I was in that \"every workout should be hard\" mentality until I trusted the 80/20 plan. My hard workouts were tough, but having fresh legs going into them was key.\"\n\n\"I tell everyone about your plans. I\u2019ve recently PR\u2019d my 5k, half, full marathon, and 70.3.\"\n\n\"The 80/20 principles allowed me to improve my times for 5K and 10K cross country races. Staying injury-free paves the way to get personal bests because you can finish the plan with no surprises and no steps back.\"\n\n\"This past weekend I completed Ironman Wisconsin on the Run/Bike Power version of the Level 2 80/20 plan. While the volume was drastically higher than any I had done in past years, I had no injuries and I felt confident in the specificity of the purpose for each workout. On race day I was able to hit my power and pace targets and finish strong with a smile on my face!\"\n\n\"The 80/20 program made my first Olympic Triathlon not only attainable, but something that left me hungry and ready for more the moment I crossed the finish line.\"\n\n\"After three surgeries in three years I realized my way of training was wrong. After reading the book 80/20 Triathlon I decided to give it a try. It was fun and easy to follow and I ended up with my a PR in all three disciplines!\"\n\n\"I like 80/20 because it gives me permission to take it easy on some day. I don\u2019t need to go out and hammer every day to get a new PR like I did in the beginning. The easy days are enjoyable and give me the power to nail (most of) my harder workouts. I don\u2019t dread my sprint and hill work anymore, and at 54 I\u2019m still setting PRs and I\u2019ve been injury free.\"\n\n\"I really felt my endurance build consistently throughout the training with my Level 3 80/20 Ironman 70.3 Plan. I was fatigued at times but never felt overtrained, and I went into my A race feeling more prepared then the three years prior.\"\n\n\"With this style of training, you can feel your gains throughout the season and you don't feel completely gassed every day.\"\n\n\"By following the 80/20 program I transformed from a 222-lb nonrunner to a 175-lb marathoner in the 10 months.\"\n\n\"I swear by 80/20 and always talk it up during tri conversations. Thank you!\"\n\n\"Heart rate training can definitely feel like defeat when you focus on how slow your training paces are, but the victory comes on race day. I am so glad I found 80/20 Running!\"\n\n\"Before I started your program I predicted a 14-hour finish in my first Ironman. After sticking to the program and training for six months my conference grew tremendously. I crushed my goal by three hours!\"\n\n\"With 80/20 training, I improved my 70.3 result by almost half an hour.\"\n\n\"By following the principles of the 80/20 programming I was able to finish my first ever Half Ironman. Leading up to the Half Ironman, I also ran my first ever half marathon. The 80/20 programming also helped me to get through my full racing season injury free as well as feeling well trained and ready for all of my races.\"\n\n\"Absolutely loved the plan. It has allowed me to cut almost 8 1/2 minutes off my half marathon PB. The workouts were varied and fun (well sometimes fun in a brutal way haha) and I got great support from David when I had any questions about the plan. Would recommend unreservedly.\"\n\n\"The 80/20 plan allowed me to train every day without getting stressed or fatigued and to show up on the day and perform fresh and uninjured.\"\n\n\"I've successfully lowered my Ironman 70.3 time by nearly 40 minutes through 80/20. Don\u2019t be afraid to go slow when you\u2019re supposed to!\"\n\n\"Used an 80/20 plan for Ironman 70.3 Bintan in Indonesia and it went perfectly. Sometimes I had doubts that the training was too light or intense, but I kept repeating to myself \"Trust the plan\" and I ended up having an amazing race--much faster than expected!\"\n\n\"I trained with the 80/20 half marathon plan, and did a personal best! I felt good after! It made me think about what it could do for me for a marathon or beyond. It taught me so much about how to pace myself and be more in tune with my body when I ran. I cannot recommend this training enough. It made me believe that Matt Fitzgerald and David Warden truly know how to train us to be better athletes.\"\n\n\"80/20 provided a method and training plan that made me excel beyond my wildest imagination in my ever first triathlon.\"\n\n\"I loved the Olympic plan I used about a year ago. Now I'm ready to do a half-Ironman.\"\n\n\"After deciding to pursue the goal of qualifying for the Boston Marathon, I purchased an 80/20 training plan. The results were dramatic. After one training cycle, I dropped over 31 minutes in my marathon time!\"\n\n\"I am satisfied with your 80/20 training plan. Thank you very much for your help in attaining my goals.\"\n\n\"There\u2019s no way I could have accomplished what I have without adhering to the 80/20 plan.\"\n\n\"When I made the switch to 80/20 I quickly realized that after 10 years of hard training, this new method felt very doable and was a comfortable fit. Thanks for making it available to us in the age-group triathlon world.\"\n\n\"The best year ever! After a few years of sporadic training efforts and competing in triathlons from Sprint distance to full Ironman I decided to look into a more structured approach to training. After looking into the plethora of plans available, I selected a 80/20 Endurance plans. I completed 2 Sprints, 1 Olympic, 3 halves and 1 full Ironman, and setting personal bests at all distances, slicing 2 hours 20 from the full Ironman.\"\n\n\"Kudos and appreciation to your training programs as I set a new 1/2 marathon PB at 1:28:20 (6:13 off my previous best). My cycling FTP is now just short of 300W (from 230W) after starting training with your programs around 8 months ago. I also took 30 minutes off my 70.3 personal best time with a 4:56, while balancing a large family and professional commitments.\"\n\n\"This year I decided to use an 80/20 plan. For the first time, I felt that my training had structure; each unit was part of a whole and it made sense. I was very satisfied with the results.\"\n\n\"I PB'd every race I did this year and then topped it off with my first 70.3 thanks to the 80/20 plan I used! PB'd the Olympic distance at nationals! The 80/20 method really changed my approach to training and got me fitter than I've ever been without a single injury.\"\n\n\"Matt created a customized training plan for me that not only allowed me to balance triathlon training with marathon training, but to have PR's in all my repeat races!\"\n\n\"I used 80/20 for all of my raining this year and got my highest age-group finishes at any event in my nine years of racing triathlons.\"\n\n\"In my first triathlon after switching to 80/20 I had my fastest swim pace at any distance and my fastest Olympic bike and run splits. Even my transitions were faster!\"\n\n\"I purchased the 80/20 70.3 plan and it completely changed my game. Knowing what workouts you have to do and when to do them removed the hardest part of training for an event, in my opinion. All I had to do was show up when I said I was going to.\"\n\n\"IUsing your Level 3 Ironman 70.3 Plan I have gone from the bottom third to the top third in my age group at the half-Ironman distance.\"\n\n\"I have started to run after few years off and the 80/20 plan allowed me to get fit and achieve my first half marathon in Verona in no time! What I love most is that following a clear and defined plan boosts my motivation because I can see the progress I am making.\"\n\n\"David and 8020 helped me set a new half marathon PR of 1:46 from 2:35 in 15 weeks. Thank you David for your hands-on coaching. I love the data-driven, balanced approach. I'll never overtrain again.\"\n\n\"Training towards sustainable functionality is more important than pushing to the limit. By using the 80/20 system you have the luxury of both worlds!\"\n\n\"I used the 80/20 plan for the first time this year. I absolutely loved it. Well Balanced and effective. I can't wait till my preparation for next year starts.\"\n\n\"After reading 80/20 Running and focusing on slowing down, I am absolutely amazed at the results. I just completed a PB of 2:52:48. By slowing down my recovery has been excellent.\"\n\n\"Using an 80/20 plan, we both came in 7th place in our AG at 70.3 New Zealand! We were fresh all the time and the fatigue we had become accustomed to all those years was not there.\"\n\n\"Using an 80/20 plan I not only set a PB in 70.3 but then 2 weeks later set a PB in a full Ironman and qualified for Kona!\"\n\n\"I have travelled with 80/20 plans within my country, to Boston in 2018, and soon to Berlin. I am now a wholly better person than I was before.\"\n\nWe re-did our website twice in a 12 month period. There was no comparison between the first company and Thrive.

          "snippet": "Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock for the past 7 or 8 years, you\u2019re probably\n\n*pretty *familiar with Mat Fraser.\n\nYou don\u2019t even need to watch the video; the title is enough.\n\n\u201cMat Fraser is the Five-Time Fittest Man on Earth\u201d\n\n(Fraser even wrote a ~300-page book detailing his adventure; you can read my review of the Hard Work Pays Off Book here!)\n\nFraser retired from the sport after his fifth CrossFit Games and could have easily ridden off into the sunset. He certainly had a lot of endorsements and prize money to last him.\n\nInstead, he decided to grace the world with his take on CrossFit training, creating a program, HWPO (\u201cHard Work Pays Off\u201d) that can be had for $40 a month.\n\nI followed HWPO\u2019s Flagship program pretty closely for roughly 18 months and feel as though I have a pretty good grasp on what the training is all about.\n\nHere is my HWPO programming review (as well as my wife\u2019s experience with HWPO 60) and my thoughts on how it may or may not be\n\n*the* program for other CrossFitters.\n\nTLDR: It is a pretty good CrossFit training program\u2026but I\n\n*much* prefer (both the program itself and my results) Sentinel Training.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n## Program Structure\n\nThe HWPO programming structure is unique (to me at least) in the manner in which each workout is scheduled. Rather than simply dropping you in to wherever a particular program is at the current moment (Ex. Comptrain), there is a definite \u201cDay 1\u201d, \u201cDay 100\u201d, \u201cDay 400\u201d and on. You\u2019ll start with the same workouts everybody else has started with and work through the same cycles whether you jump in early January, April, or October.\n\n(that year, there was a \u201cOpen Prep\u201d option added for those looking to prep for the upcoming open, but this was programming split off from the \u201cFlagship\u201d track).\n\nI like this structure and think that it gets all participants \u201cup to speed\u201d with the program\u2019s overall structure as well as those of each workout. Even advanced athletes would likely struggle if they randomly dropped into \u201cDay 273\u201d of the program due to relatively intense nature of the workouts. The first few program weeks do an excellent job of preparing athletes for the rigors to come.\n\nFraser has programmed a number of cycles and \u201cwaves\u201d into the program, most notably those involving squats, Olympic lifts and rowing\u2026yeah\u2026rowing.\n\nYou do\n\n*a lot *of rowing the HWPO training program! Mal O\u2019Brien can confirm!\n\nThere is obviously a method to this and I can attest that my strength and rowing\n\n*endurance *levels (I still needed a bit of technique work!) have gotten better (and probably better than they *would *have gotten with other, general programming) with HWPO programming.\n\nThere are 5 \u201cnormal\u201d training days each week. One day is a full rest day while another day involves much shorter and \u201clighter\u201d activity (ex. spin bike, light swimming).\n\n## Workout Structure \u2013 HWPO Flagship vs. HWPO 60\n\nNow that I have experience with multiple HWPO training programs, I will split this section up to discuss each in detail.\n\n### HWPO Flagship\n\nWorkouts in the Flagship program take on a pretty consistent pattern. A decently intense active warm-up (with movements somewhat mimicking the exercises) starts things off followed by strength pieces. Without fail, squats and front squats are programmed twice a week and deadlifts and bench press each once a week. Olympic lifts are generally performed three days each week with the volume and variety differing depending on the cycle.\n\nThe overall volume and rep counts differ greatly here, but you can expect to perform between 10 and 22-25 working sets during this portion. All of the weights for these sets are based off of 1RM percentages.\n\nAfter the strength piece there is some kind of cardio element, whether in the form of a classic metcon, a dedicated rowing piece, or a dedicated Assault Bike/Echo Bike piece. These generally last between 12 and 20 minutes.\n\nAccessory work and \u201cBonus work\u201d close out each workout. While the bonus content is not always present, accessory work\n\n*always *is. Interestingly enough, these portions vary *greatly *in length and intensity. Some days, a few sets of GHD-machine back extensions are programmed. Other times, you might find something like\u2026this\u2026\n\nThe length of HWPO training workouts has been discussed at length before and, truth be told, the workouts can go\n\n*pretty *long. I generally keep my rest periods between 2 and 3 minutes during the strength pieces and still end up hitting my self-imposed 1:50 workout \u201ctime cap\u201d about 70 percent of the time.\n\nI know others rest less than I do during these pieces, but I don\u2019t rest very long between pieces. As such, I don\u2019t know who can reasonably expect to consistently get through these workouts in less than 1:45. If you\u2019re not particularly \u201cfast\u201d, expect to make some cuts to each workout.\n\n### HWPO 60\n\nRecently, my wife started the \u201cHWPO 60\u201d program\u2026and is\n\n*loving *it. After bouncing around between HWPO Flagship (we started at the same time, although she switched programs after about 10 months) and Street Parking (and one\u2026less-than-enjoyable day of PRVN) she decided to re-join the HWPO \u201cfamily\u201d!\n\nAlthough it has been quite a while since she started HWPO Flagship, via careful notes she kept, she is able to compare the early days of the program to the first week of HWPO. Essentially, the program content are very,\n\n*very *similar.\n\n**The main difference**? On most days of HWPO 60, either a strength piece or an accessory piece (sometimes multiple accessory pieces) is removed from the HWPO Flagship program. More rarely, the metcon or rowing piece is anywhere between 25 and 33 percent shorter and/or the percentages for strength workouts are slightly lighter.\n\nOther than that, the programs are the same. My wife has never clocked a longer than 70 minutes in an HWPO 60 workout (completing\n\n*all* pieces *and *accounting for warm-up and clean-up time) yet still feels as though she is getting a *complete* training experience.\n\n## Intensity\n\nThere are definitely intensity waves programmed into the HWPO programming, but\n\n*everything *feels pretty intense to me most of the time. Even the standard 40-minute EMOM (usually scheduled for Saturday or Sunday) generally has one or two elements that up the ante.\n\nThat being said, there is always a \u201cheavy\u201d squat day and a \u201clight\u2026ish\u201d squat day each week. During many of the high-intensity metcons, there are built-in break periods to force you to take your foot off of the gas for a bit.\n\nThese forced breaks, while giving you a brief respite from the WOD\u2019s rigors, actually work to\n\n*increase *the overall intensity. In contrast to a 20-minute AMRAP that you might \u201cget lost\u201d in the middle of, 4, 2-minute AMRAPs with 1-minute rest periods between them forces you to *really *give it your all in each work window.\n\n## Equipment Needs\n\nHWPO programming assumes you have access to a good amount of equipment to include barbells, bumpers, dumbbells, kettlebells, GHD, rower, fan bike, ski erg, spin bike, weighted vest, bench, pull-up rig, rings, rope, sandbag\u2026probably some other stuff, too, but you get the point.\n\nYou can modify a lot of the movements (and if you listen to Fraser\u2019s detailed, 10-15-minute explanations before each workout, he\u2019ll mention these modifications from time to time), but I think you\n\n*really *need most of this stuff to get the most benefit from the workouts and program.\n\nI didn\u2019t have a ski erg or a spin bike (although I did have a dinky, cheap upright bike) so would generally sub some other type of cardio machine out for these items. The ski erg hadn\u2019t become\n\n*that* popular (yet) so I didn\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve missed out too much on something vital.\n\n## Community\n\nIn addition to all of the programming and videos from Fraser discussing workouts and movements, there is a dedicated HWPO Circle community for all paid members.\n\nThis community functions kind of like a subreddit community or Facebook group with members discussing their workouts, asking questions, and soliciting form feedback. Generally, form-related videos receive almost instant feedback from other HWPO members. There are also HWPO staff coaches who closely monitor the groups who are quick to provide feedback.\n\nThe Circle group is probably\n\n*most* valuable for the garage or basement gym HWPO athletes who desire more of a community setting or for those who don\u2019t have access to eyes-on coaching. It is no substitute for immediate, in-person feedback, but it is definitely the next best thing!\n\n## \u201cWho is HWPO Flagship\n\n*Truly *Designed For?\u201d\n\n\u201cIntensity\u201d and \u201cdifficulty\u201d are not always mutually inclusive concepts, but with HWPO training, I feel as though there is a\n\n*bit *of overlap. I oftentimes felt myself wondering \u201cwho the heck is this program *truly *designed for?!\u201d I say this by thinking about my own capability in relation to those of the general CrossFit population.\n\nThe last couple of years, I have messed around with the CrossFit Open workouts. I have always gone hard when performing them, but haven\u2019t re-tested any of them and haven\u2019t altered my training to accommodate them. When the dust has cleared, I would have easily qualified for the Age-Group Quarterfinals and possibly even for the overall QFs.\n\nThat being said, I find myself scaling weights or movements during the HWPO metcons and cardio pieces between\n\n**60 and 70 percent of the time**.\n\nI am obviously not an elite athlete, but the top dogs are getting (good) individualized coaching and programming.\n\n\u2026so, again\u2026\u201dwho the heck is this program designed for?!\u201d\n\nThere is definitely a gap between my ability level and the\n\n*near *top-level athletes who HWPO Flagship is probably *perfect *for. Not much scaling of weights or exercises\u2026the *perfect *level of intensity and challenge.\n\nHowever, I feel like this gap can\u2019t be\n\n*that *big and that most people running the program are scaling as much, if not more often than I am.\n\nThis isn\u2019t even taking into account the long workout durations. If I didn\u2019t work from home, if I had kids, etc. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d fit it all in, seeing that I have to time cap myself anyways (I\u2019d probably\n\n*have* to go with HWPO 60)!\n\nIf you\u2019re willing to humble yourself and use some discretion to scale workouts and to focus your attention on areas you need the most work on, you can\n\n*definitely *benefit from the Flagship or HWPO 60 programs.\n\n## Personal Results\n\nI took the plunge into HWPO programming in February of 2022 when I first moved into my new basement gym. I had been doing some less-than-ideal and unorganized \u201cself-programming\u201d (sic) for close to a year in the old garage cube and was a bit out of shape.\n\nThe \u201con-boarding\u201d weeks were perfect for me and I quickly re-gained much of my previous conditioning while also quickly growing accustomed to the program\u2019s structure.\n\nIn a little over a year\u2019s time, I set PRs in almost all of the program\u2019s barbell movements (squat, front squat, deadlift, power snatch, snatch, strict press) with the clean and jerk being the notable exceptions (I have personal issues with these lifts that I need to get sorted with eyes-on coaching!) Additionally, my rowing and Assault Bike capabilities\n\nShortly before taking my break from HWPO, I re-tested CrossFit Open WOD 20.1\u2026the infamous 10 rounds of snatches and bar-facing burpees. I had been doing HWPO for\n\n*just *under a year at this point.\n\nWhen I originally did this back in late 2019, I got time capped. My second attempt improved my time to 14:47.\n\nMy most recent time (post-HWPO training)? 14:05\u2026a roughly 5 percent improvement.\n\nMaybe not the\n\n*most *impressive improvement example, but I was satisfied.\n\n## Conclusion/Suggestion\n\nIt\u2019s hard to argue with the CrossFit GOAT about what works\u2026but I think he knows more about what works for\n\n*him* than it does for the masses.\n\nNot everyone is going to have the time to devote to HWPO Flagship workouts, the requisite equipment, the humility to scale (\n\n*a lot *in some cases), or the desire to do intense workouts day-in and day-out.\n\nA lot of people are also probably going to want programming that is a bit more\u2026interesting\u2026and productive.\n\nHWPO wasn\u2019t\n\n*bad*, but man\u2026I wish I had been doing Sentinel for at least part of the time that I spent \u201cworking with Fraser\u201d\u2026\n\n",

The AMRAP 20 consists of 10 push presses, 10 kettlebell swings, and 10 box jumps, designed to challenge your shoulder endurance, grip strength, and explosive power while promoting agility and coordination. With the inclusion of DT sets at increasing loads and max calorie row, this workout also emphasizes strength, stamina, and strategy through the structured breaks and round formats, making it suitable for both intermediate and advanced athletes aiming to elevate their performance.\n\n\u2026\n\nNext, transition to the max calorie row, aiming for a high output while keeping your strokes efficient. Remember to take 4 minutes of rest between each round to recover adequately and maintain performance.\n\nFor the AMRAP 20, cycle through 10 push presses, using your legs to help drive the bar overhead. Follow this with 10 kettlebell swings, ensuring to swing to at least chest height, and then complete 10 box jumps, landing softly and achieving full hip extension. Keep your transitions smooth and limit rest for optimal results.\n\n\u2026\n\nIn the second AMRAP 20, aiming for 6\u20138 rounds is solid for intermediates, while advanced and elite athletes should strive for 9+ rounds. Scores exceeding 200 total reps indicate impressive endurance and efficiency.\n\nThe intended stimulus of the benchmark workout AMRAP 20 focuses on enhancing muscular endurance and aerobic capacity. Athletes engage in repeated cycles of push presses, kettlebell swings, and box jumps, all of which target major muscle groups while elevating heart rates.",

Learn the format, all 8 stations, time goals, pacing, and a race-day checklist so you can finish strong in 2026.HYROXHYROX raceHYROX beginner\n\nSo, you\u2019ve heard about HYROX and you\u2019re wondering what the hype\u2019s all about. Maybe you saw the videos on TikTok: people running, pushing sleds, throwing wall balls, and thought,\n\n*\u201cThat looks intense... but kind of fun.\u201d* Well, you\u2019re right on both counts.\n\nHYROX is a global fitness race designed for\n\n*everyone*, from everyday gym-goers to seasoned athletes. It blends running and functional workouts in a structured format that tests endurance, strength, and grit, all in one event. Think of it as the perfect bridge between traditional endurance races and high-intensity gym training.\n\nIf you\u2019re new, the setup might sound intimidating at first. Eight 1-kilometer runs. Eight workout stations in between. Thousands of people cheering around you.\n\nBut HYROX is incredibly beginner-friendly. The race is standardized worldwide, so no matter where you compete (New York, Singapore, or Berlin) it\u2019s the same format, same challenge, same community vibe.\n\nIn this beginner\u2019s guide, you\u2019ll learn exactly how HYROX works:\n\n- The race format and station breakdown\n\n- Typical finish times and pacing goals\n\n- A simple 4-week training plan\n\n- Race-day checklists and practical tips\n\nUse this page as your playbook. Skim the station cards for quick technique cues, check the pacing table to set a goal, then follow the starter plan to build confidence week by week. Bookmark it, share it with your training buddy, and come back before race day.\n\nSource: Unsplash\n\n## What is HYROX?\n\nHYROX is a standardized indoor fitness race that combines endurance running with functional workouts. Each race follows the same format worldwide, so every athlete, from first-timers to pros, faces an identical challenge.\n\nThat\u2019s part of what makes HYROX so addictive: you can train, track your progress, and directly compare your performance with thousands of other racers around the globe.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works in simple terms:\n\n- You\u2019ll\n\n**run 1 kilometer**, then complete a **workout station**.\n\n- You\u2019ll repeat that sequence\n\n**eight times**\u2014making it **8 runs + 8 workouts**in total.\n\n- You finish with the infamous\n\n**wall balls**, which test every ounce of energy you\u2019ve got left.\n\nThe workouts focus on real-life movements\u2014pushing, pulling, carrying, rowing\u2014so you don\u2019t need to be a CrossFitter or a marathoner to join in. You just need consistency, basic fitness, and the willingness to challenge yourself.\n\nAnother reason HYROX is growing fast? HYROX is more than a race, it\u2019s an experience. Events are held in massive indoor arenas, with DJ sets, bright lights, and cheering crowds that make it feel more like a sporting festival than a competition. Whether you join solo, with a partner, or in a relay team, the atmosphere is electric and motivating from start to finish.\n\n## Race format at a glance\n\nEvery HYROX event follows the same structure worldwide, no surprises, no hidden twists. That\u2019s part of the magic. You know exactly what\u2019s coming, and you can train specifically for it.\n\nHere\u2019s the simple breakdown:\n\n**Run 1 km \u2192 Workout Station 1 \u2192 Run 1 km \u2192 Workout Station 2 \u2026 all the way to Station 8.**\n\nBy the end, you\u2019ll have covered\n\n**8 kilometers of running** and completed **8 functional workout stations**. The entire race is done indoors, usually in a large convention center, so you don\u2019t have to worry about weather, terrain, or route changes.\n\nEach station tests a different part of your fitness:\n\n**Strength**(sled push and pull) **Power**(wall balls, burpee broad jumps) **Endurance**(row and SkiErg) **Stability and coordination**(farmer\u2019s carry, lunges)\n\nBetween every workout, you\u2019ll return to the\n\n**running track**, your recovery and reset time before the next challenge.\n\nRight in the middle of all this action is the\n\n**Roxzone.**\n\nRoxzine is the transition area connecting your run to the workout stations. Managing this zone efficiently is key to a smooth race. It\u2019s where you\u2019ll catch your breath, pick up equipment, and move between workouts. Think of it as your pit stop: fast, focused, and efficient.\n\nNo matter the location, London, Sydney, or Chicago, the HYROX course layout, order of stations, and distance remain identical. That\u2019s what makes it the first truly global fitness race. Your time in one city can be directly compared to someone racing halfway across the world.\n\nSource: Unsplash\n\n## HYROX categories explained\n\nOne of the coolest things about HYROX is that it\u2019s designed for\n\n*everyone*. You get to pick the level that matches your current fitness and goals. There\u2019s no need to \u201cqualify\u201d for any category, and you can always move up when you\u2019re ready.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick breakdown of the four main HYROX categories:\n\n#### 1. Open\n\nThis is the standard and most popular division for first-timers.\n\n- Moderate weights for sled push/pull, lunges, and wall balls.\n\n- Designed for accessibility, so anyone with a decent fitness base can finish.\n\n- Perfect for your first race or if you\u2019re still working on technique and pacing.\n\n**Goal:** Complete and enjoy the experience while setting your personal benchmark.\n\n#### 2. Pro\n\nThis is where things get heavier and faster.\n\n- The format is the same, but weights increase significantly.\n\n- Usually chosen by experienced athletes, CrossFitters, or competitive racers.\n\n- Expect a tougher challenge, but also the thrill of pushing your limits.\n\n**Goal:** Compete for rankings or improve on your Open time with added resistance.\n\n#### 3. Doubles\n\nRace with a partner and share the work!\n\n- Both teammates run the full 8 km together.\n\n- The workout stations are split however you like using the\n\n**\u201cYou Go, I Go\u201d (YGIG)**rule.\n\n- Great for friends, couples, or training buddies who want to experience HYROX together without the full individual load.\n\n**Goal:** Divide and conquer, teamwork and pacing make all the difference.\n\n#### 4. Relay\n\nIdeal for teams of four.\n\n- Each member completes 2 runs and 2 workout stations before tagging the next teammate.\n\n- It\u2019s fast, loud, and super fun, perfect for groups or corporate challenges.\n\n**Goal:** Go all out in your section and experience the HYROX energy without doing the entire race solo.\n\nSource: Unsplash\n\n## The 8 HYROX workout stations explained\n\nEvery HYROX race features the\n\n**same eight workout stations**, always in the **same order**. This consistency makes training easier because you can prepare for exactly what\u2019s coming. Each station challenges a different aspect of fitness: cardio, strength, power, endurance, and stability.\n\nLet\u2019s break them down one by one:\n\n#### 1. SkiErg (1,000 meters)\n\nThe first station hits your upper body and lungs hard.\n\n**Focus:**Pulling power and rhythm. **Tip:**Keep strokes long and controlled, don\u2019t sprint too early. **Common mistake:**Hunching over or using only your arms instead of driving from the hips.\n\n#### 2. Sled Push (50 meters)\n\nA full-body power test that hits your legs and core.\n\n**Focus:**Strong drive through your quads and glutes. **Tip:**Keep a low body angle, short steps, and constant tension. **Common mistake:**Pushing with just your arms or standing too upright, which kills momentum.\n\n#### 3. Sled Pull (50 meters)\n\nNow the pull to balance out the push.\n\n**Focus:**Grip strength and posterior chain. **Tip:**Use a hand-over-hand motion, lean back slightly, and walk backward steadily. **Common mistake:**Jerky pulls that waste ener, smooth is fast here.\n\n#### 4. Burpee Broad Jumps (80 meters)\n\nIt\u2019s as brutal as it sounds, but pacing is key.\n\n**Focus:**Explosiveness and endurance. **Tip:**Land softly, keep jumps consistent, and rest in the standing position if you need to catch your breath. **Common mistake:**Jumping too far and burning out early.\n\n#### 5. Row (1,000 meters)\n\nA cardio reset that still taxes your legs and core.\n\n**Focus:**Efficient stroke rhythm, don\u2019t rush it. **Tip:**Drive with your legs first, then hinge back, then pull with your arms. **Common mistake:**Over-pulling or neglecting leg drive.\n\n#### 6. Farmer\u2019s Carry (200 meters)\n\nSimple but deceiving. Grip and core control are everything.\n\n**Focus:**Stability and breathing under load. **Tip:**Keep shoulders back, walk tall, and take measured steps. **Common mistake:**Leaning or swinging weights, which drains your grip faster.\n\n#### 7. Sandbag Lunges (100 meters)\n\nYour legs will hate you here, but it\u2019s almost the end.\n\n**Focus:**Balance, endurance, and leg power. **Tip:**Keep your core tight and knees at 90 degrees with every step. **Common mistake:**Short steps or skipping the knee touch, can cost penalties.\n\n#### 8. Wall Balls (75 reps for men / 50 for women)\n\nThe grand finale, your heart rate spikes, but the crowd carries you through.\n\n**Focus:**Coordination and consistent breathing. **Tip:**Stay calm, use leg power, and aim for smooth sets of 10\u201315 reps. **Common mistake:**Dropping the ball too often, small, steady sets beat big burnout sets.\n\nSource: Unsplash\n\n## How long does HYROX take?\n\nOne of the most common questions beginners ask is:\n\n*\u201cHow long will it take me to finish HYROX?\u201d*\n\nThe short answer, somewhere between\n\n**60 and 120 minutes**, depending on your fitness level, pacing, and category.\n\nBut let\u2019s break it down a little more clearly.\n\n#### Average finishing times\n\n**Elite athletes (Pro Men/Women):**55\u201375 minutes **Intermediate athletes (Open):**80\u2013100 minutes **First-timers:**100\u2013120 minutes\n\nRemember: there\u2019s no time limit. You can take as long as you need to finish, and the crowd will still cheer just as loud when you cross that line. HYROX is about personal challenge, not just competition.\n\n#### Typical time breakdown\n\n#### \u201cGood\u201d benchmark goals\n\nIf you\u2019re training for your first HYROX and want a rough benchmark:\n\n**Under 100 mins:**Strong first-timer, well-balanced fitness. **Around 110 mins:**Solid finish with steady pacing. **Under 90 mins:**You\u2019ve officially caught the HYROX bug, and trained well!\n\n#### Pacing strategy\n\nThe biggest mistake beginners make? Starting too fast.\n\nThat first 1 km run feels easy, but it\u2019s a trap. Aim to finish your first two runs feeling like you could go faster, not gasping for air. That controlled start will help you maintain energy for the final three stations, where most people hit the wall.\n\n**Tip:** Treat the run segments as active recovery. Slow down slightly between heavy stations, regulate your breathing, and save your push for the final two kilometers.\n\n## Race-day checklist\n\nDial in the simple stuff so you can focus on moving well. Use this list the night before.\n\n#### Must-bring items\n\n- Photo ID, registration QR, waiver\n\n- Race wristband if collected at packet pick-up\n\n- Shoes with good indoor grip, spare laces\n\n- Socks (bring a backup pair)\n\n- Outfit: top, shorts/tights, sports bra (for women)\n\n- Anti-chafe stick, tape for hot spots\n\n- Small towel\n\n- Electrolytes, bottle, light carbs (bananas, gels, chews)\n\n- Post-race snack, recovery drink\n\n- Cash/card for venue food and merch\n\n#### Nice-to-have gear\n\n- Knee sleeves for lunges\n\n- Thin gloves for sled pull rope\n\n- Wrist strap for timing chip if provided\n\n- Portable massage ball or mini band\n\n#### What to wear\n\n- Lightweight, breathable layers\n\n- Secure pockets or race belt for gels\n\n- Shoes with stable midsole and good forefoot traction\n\n#### Warm-up (10\u201315 minutes)\n\n- Easy jog or brisk walk 5 minutes\n\n- Mobility: hips, calves, thoracic spine\n\n- Activation: bodyweight squats, lunges, plank 30 seconds\n\n- Two short strides or SkiErg/rower pickups at comfortable effort\n\n#### Pre-start fueling\n\n- Night before: normal dinner with extra carbs and water\n\n- 2\u20133 hours before: simple carb-heavy meal you trust\n\n- 15\u201320 minutes before: sip electrolytes, optional small carb bite\n\n#### Timing at the venue\n\n- Arrive 60\u201390 minutes before your wave\n\n- Bag drop and restroom first\n\n- Walk the Roxzone entry and exit paths\n\n- Locate start pen early\n\n#### Roxzone habits that save minutes\n\n- Keep moving with small steps, breathe through the nose on entry\n\n- Set equipment once, avoid re-adjusting mid-station\n\n- Exit decisively, settle into run pace in the first 50\u2013100 meters\n\n#### Mental checklist before the gun\n\n- First 2 km controlled pace\n\n- Smooth reps over big sets\n\n- Sip fluids between stations as needed\n\n- One cue per station: posture, breath, rhythm\n\nPack it all the night before, lay out your outfit, and set two alarms. Calm morning, clean execution.\n\n## How to pace your first HYROX\n\nPacing can make or break your HYROX race. Go out too fast, and you\u2019ll hit the wall by station three. Go too slow, and you\u2019ll finish with too much left in the tank. The key is finding that middle ground: steady, controlled effort from start to finish.\n\n#### 1. Start slower than you think\n\nThe first 1 km run always feels easy, especially with adrenaline and music pumping. But don\u2019t get carried away. Keep your effort around\n\n**70\u201375%** of what feels \u201chard.\u201d You should be breathing steadily, not gasping. Remember, you\u2019ve got eight rounds to go.\n\n#### 2. Use the runs as active recovery\n\nHYROX isn\u2019t eight sprints, it\u2019s a rhythm race. The running sections are your chance to bring your heart rate down between stations. Use shorter, efficient strides and relax your shoulders. Think of it as your reset before the next big effort.\n\n#### 3. Control your transitions\n\nThe\n\n**Roxzone** (your transition area) is where many athletes lose time. Don\u2019t stop to rest here. Slow down your walk, grab your equipment smoothly, and start the movement. Aim for **no more than 10\u201315 seconds** between run and station.\n\n#### 4. Station strategy\n\nEach workout station has its own pacing trick:\n\n**SkiErg / Row:**Keep strokes smooth and steady. Save power for the finish. **Sled Push / Pull:**Use short bursts, then rest 3\u20135 seconds instead of grinding nonstop. **Burpees / Wall Balls:**Break reps into manageable sets early\u201410s or 15s\u2014and stick to your plan. **Farmer\u2019s Carry / Lunges:**Focus on posture and breathing; these stations are about control, not speed.\n\n#### 5. Negative split your race\n\nIf you can, aim to finish stronger than you started. That means holding back in the first half and gradually increasing pace from station five onward. It\u2019s far more rewarding to overtake people later than to get passed in the final stretch.\n\n#### 6. Watch the clock, but don\u2019t chase it\n\nUse your watch or on-site timer to stay aware of your total time, but don\u2019t obsess. HYROX is about rhythm and flow. Stick to your strategy, manage your energy, and you\u2019ll likely finish faster than expected.\n\n## Common rookie mistakes (and how to fix them)\n\nEvery HYROX athlete makes mistakes at their first race, it\u2019s practically a rite of passage. But the good news? Most of them are easy to avoid once you know what to look out for. Here are the most common slip-ups beginners make and how to fix them fast.\n\n#### 1. Starting too fast\n\n**The mistake:** Sprinting the first run like it\u2019s a 5K.\n\n**The fix:** Treat the first 2 km as a warm-up. Keep your breathing under control and aim for a pace you can maintain for 90+ minutes. You\u2019ll thank yourself later.\n\n#### 2. Ignoring transitions\n\n**The mistake:** Standing still between runs and stations to \u201ccatch your breath.\u201d\n\n**The fix:** Keep moving. Slow your walk, focus on deep breathing, and start the next movement before your mind talks you out of it. Time disappears quickly in the Roxzone.\n\n#### 3. Poor sled technique\n\n**The mistake:** Standing upright and pushing with arms only, or jerking the rope on the pull.\n\n**The fix:** Stay low, drive from your legs, and maintain constant pressure on the push. On the pull, use a smooth hand-over-hand motion while leaning slightly back.\n\n#### 4. Skipping recovery and hydration\n\n**The mistake:** Not drinking enough or relying solely on adrenaline.\n\n**The fix:** Sip electrolytes before and during the event. A small carb snack 30\u201345 minutes before your heat keeps energy steady through the later stations.\n\n#### 5. Overestimating wall balls\n\n**The mistake:** Trying to hit all 75 (or 50) reps unbroken.\n\n**The fix:** Break early and strategically. Sets of 10\u201315 reps with short pauses keep your form clean and prevent burnout. Smooth and steady wins here.\n\n#### 6. Wearing the wrong shoes\n\n**The mistake:** Showing up in thick-soled running shoes with no grip.\n\n**The fix:** Choose a stable, low-profile trainer with good traction on indoor flooring. Slipping on sleds or lunges can cost time and confidence.\n\n#### 7. Neglecting strength in training\n\n**The mistake:** Only running to prepare for HYROX.\n\n**The fix:** Mix in functional strength days: lunges, sled pushes, carries. The race rewards balanced conditioning, not just cardio.\n\n#### 8. Forgetting to enjoy it\n\n**The mistake:** Treating HYROX like a punishment instead of an event.\n\n**The fix:** Look up, smile, and soak in the energy. The crowd, music, and community vibe are part of the reason people keep coming back.\n\n## Gear that actually helps\n\nYou don\u2019t need fancy gear to crush your first HYROX, but a few smart choices can make the experience way smoother (and save you from painful blisters or wasted energy).\n\nHere\u2019s what really matters:\n\n#### 1. Shoes: Grip over gimmicks\n\nYour shoes can make or break your sled stations. You\u2019ll be on polished indoor floors, not outdoor tracks, so\n\n**traction and stability** are everything.\n\n\u2705 Look for flat, firm soles with good grip.\n\n\u2705 Avoid squishy running shoes, they absorb force instead of transferring it.\n\n\u2705 Training shoes like cross-trainers or hybrid running/strength models usually perform best.\n\n**Tip:** Try your shoes on wet or smooth flooring before race day. If you slip while pushing a sled, it\u2019ll cost time and energy.\n\n#### 2. Gloves: Optional but useful\n\nSome athletes swear by gloves for the sled pull and farmer\u2019s carry, others hate them.\n\n- Use\n\n**thin grip gloves**or chalk if you tend to get sweaty hands.\n\n- Skip thick gloves, they\u2019ll make gripping the rope harder.\n\n- Test them during training so there are no surprises on race day.\n\n#### 3. Knee sleeves or pads\n\nLunges and burpees can get tough on hard floors. A light pair of\n\n**neoprene knee sleeves** adds support and protects from bruising.\n\n- Choose flexible, breathable sleeves, not powerlifting-style thick ones.\n\n- Bonus: they keep your knees warm, helping mobility early in the race.\n\n#### 4. Apparel\n\nYou\u2019ll sweat, a lot, so pick\n\n**moisture-wicking fabrics**.\n\n- Tank or fitted top: avoids fabric snagging on sleds.\n\n- Compression shorts or leggings: reduce chafing and keep things secure.\n\n- Sports bra with strong support (for women).\n\n- Avoid cotton, it gets heavy and stays wet.\n\n#### 5. Accessories\n\n**Timing chip strap:**make sure it\u2019s secure before the start. **Small towel:**for quick wipes in transition areas. **Lightweight belt or pocket:**to hold gels or small fuel if needed. **Water bottle or electrolyte pack:**optional if the venue provides hydration zones, but always good to have.\n\n## Gear that actually helps\n\nBefore you step onto the starting line, it helps to know the key terms you\u2019ll hear tossed around at HYROX events and in training videos. Here\u2019s a quick glossary to get you sounding (and feeling) like a pro:\n\n#### 1. Roxzone\n\nThe central transition area that connects your runs to each workout station. You\u2019ll enter and exit the Roxzone eight times during the race. Smooth transitions here can shave off minutes from your total time.\n\n#### 2. YGIG (You Go, I Go)\n\nThe rule used in\n\n*Doubles* races. One partner works while the other rests, and you can switch anytime. The strategy is to divide the work efficiently and communicate clearly.\n\n#### 3. Open\n\nThe standard HYROX category designed for most participants. Weights and distances are balanced for accessibility, making it perfect for first-timers.\n\n#### 4. Pro\n\nThe advanced division featuring heavier weights and faster pacing. Usually chosen by experienced or competitive athletes aiming for top rankings.\n\n#### 5. Doubles\n\nA two-person race where both partners run every kilometer together but split the workout stations under the YGIG rule. Great for couples, training buddies, or anyone who wants to share the load.\n\n#### 6. Relay\n\nA four-person team format. Each athlete completes two runs and two workout stations before tagging the next teammate. It\u2019s fast, fun, and loud, ideal for groups or corporate teams.\n\n#### 7. Wall Balls\n\nThe final station of every HYROX. You\u2019ll squat with a medicine ball and throw it to a target on the wall\u201475 reps for men, 50 for women. It\u2019s a mental battle as much as a physical one.\n\n#### 8. SkiErg / RowErg\n\nThe cardio machines used in two of the eight stations. Both mimic endurance movements\u2014skiing and rowing\u2014that test upper-body stamina and coordination.\n\n#### 9. Functional Fitness\n\nThe core principle of HYROX. It means exercises that mimic real-life movements (pushing, pulling, carrying, and lunging) to build practical, usable strength.\n\n#### 10. Transition Time\n\nThe seconds between finishing a run and starting the next workout. Efficient transitions can save up to 3\u20135 minutes over the course of a race.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far, you\u2019re already halfway to the start line. HYROX might look intimidating from the outside, but once you understand the format and break your training into simple, consistent steps, it becomes something incredible, a challenge that\u2019s equal parts physical grind and community celebration.\n\nYour first race isn\u2019t about speed or rankings; it\u2019s about finishing strong and learning how your body responds under pressure. Every run, every sled push, every wall ball teaches you something about pacing, resilience, and mental grit.\n\nSo here\u2019s your action plan:\n\n- Pick a HYROX category that feels right (hint:\n\n*Open*or *Doubles*are perfect starts).\n\n- Follow the 4-week plan above and practice transitions whenever you can.\n\n- Show up on race day with the mindset to\n\n*enjoy the experience*, not just survive it.\n\nAnd once you cross that finish line, no matter your time, you\u2019ll understand why so many\n\npeople call HYROX\n\n*addictive*. It\u2019s you versus you, but surrounded by a community that pushes you to keep going.\n\nReady to take the leap?\n\nCheck the official HYROX race calendar, find an event near you, and start training. Your first finish line is waiting.\n\n",
