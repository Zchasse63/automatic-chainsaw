The race was \ndesigned by Mintra Tilly, who also wrote the rulebook.\nHYROX consists of a 1 km run followed by 1 station, \nrepeated 8 times. In order to complete the entire \nHYROX race and receive a valid finishing time, the \nracers must complete the runs and stations in the \nspecific order [Run 1, workout station 1, Run 2, \nworkout station 2, etc.] until they have completed a \ntotal of 8 km running and 8 stations.\nWhilst the repetition range and/or weights differ \nbetween the divisions, the running distance remains \nthe same across all divisions: each racer must run 1 \nkm before each, i.e. a total distance of 8 km.\nThe results and ranking system are based on the \nfastest time in each respective division. Results \nare sorted from the fastest to the slowest time. In \naddition to the overall fastest men\u2019s and women\u2019s \ntimes, results are also ranked in age groups [see \nbelow], also sorted from the fastest to the slowest \ntime.\n\nHYROX EN SINGLE RULEBOOK_25/26\n5\n2 CONDITIONS OF \nPARTICIPATION\nHYROX is a race open to everyone, qualifications are \nnot required.\nBy participating in HYROX you are agreeing to the \nfollowing conditions, which include the exclusion of \nliability and the terms of the Privacy Policy which can \nbe read at https://hyrox.com/terms-and-conditions/.\n1 \nIn order to participate in a HYROX event, racers \nmust be at least 16 years old on the day of race.\n2 \nOfficial rankings will be based on racers\u2019 biological \ngender at birth.

          "snippet": "**What this means:** A \"good\" absolute RoxZone time (e.g., 5:00) at Utrecht might be 5:30 at another venue with longer transition distances. However, the **performance gap between elite and recreational athletes remains consistent** (roughly 3:00-3:30 difference), as does the percentage of race time (~6.5%).\n\n**Takeaway:** Focus on the *percentage* of race time (aim for under 6.5%) and *relative improvement* rather than hitting specific absolute times.\n\n\u2026\n\n|1:20-1:30 (Intermediate)|5:19|40 seconds|6.3%|\n|1:30+ (Recreational)|6:58|52 seconds|6.8%|\n**The gap:** Recreational athletes spend **3:17 longer** in transitions than elite athletes. Intermediate athletes are wasting **1:37** compared to elites.\n\nThat's not a typo. Over\n\n**3 minutes** of pure transition time separating recreational from elite performance. No fitness required, no strength training needed - just **urgency and efficiency**.\n\n## Why Slower Athletes Waste More Time\n\nThe data shows something fascinating: as finish times increase, RoxZone doesn't just increase in absolute terms - it increases as a\n\n**percentage of total race time**.\n\n**Elite athletes (under 1:10):** 5.5% of race in transitions\n\n**Recreational (1:30+):** 6.8% of race in transitions\n\nWhy? Three reasons:\n\n### 1. Mental Gear Shifting\n\nElite athletes operate with\n\n**constant urgency**. The moment they complete a station, their brain is already on \"move to next task.\" They're jogging to start the next run before their heart rate settles.\n\nRecreational athletes tend to mentally \"complete\" the station, take a breath, walk, adjust clothing, maybe grab water. These micro-recoveries add 5-10 seconds per transition.\n\n**Over 8 transitions:** 40-80 seconds lost.\n\n\u2026\n\nOur data shows recreational athletes average\n\n**52 seconds per transition** vs **28 seconds for elites** - a **24-second gap**. Over 8 transitions, that's exactly **3:12** - matching our total RoxZone variance.\n\n**The mindset shift:** Treat RoxZone like you treat running. You wouldn't stop mid-run to catch your breath. Don't stop mid-transition either.",

          "snippet": "Not all HYROX stations are created equal. While every station matters, some show dramatically larger time differences between advanced and intermediate athletes. Understanding which stations offer the greatest opportunity for improvement is crucial for efficient training.\n\nWe analyzed 200,000+ race results from athletes finishing in 1:20 (advanced), 1:30 (intermediate), and 1:40 (recreational) brackets. The findings reveal where slower athletes lose the most time - and where focused training can yield the biggest gains.\n\n#### Key Takeaway\n\n**Note on Running:** While this analysis focuses on workout stations, running accounts for ~50-55% of total race time and shows significant variance between brackets (8+ minutes difference). We cover running strategy and pace management in detail in our article The Mid-Race Crisis: When and Why You Slow Down.\n\n## The Variance Analysis\n\nTime variance measures how much the average time differs between the fastest (1:20) and slowest (1:40) brackets for each station. Stations with high variance represent larger improvement opportunities - these are where fitness level has the biggest impact.\n\nThe chart above ranks stations by their time variance between brackets. The longer the bar, the more time separates advanced from recreational athletes on that station.\n\n## High-Impact Stations: Where Time Is Won or Lost\n\n### Wall Balls: The #1 Differentiator\n\n**Time Variance:** Men 2:26, Women 2:02\n\nWall Balls consistently emerge as the single biggest separator between brackets. Advanced male athletes average 5:36, while recreational athletes take 8:02 - a massive 146-second difference. For women, the gap is 122 seconds (4:28 vs 6:30).\n\n**Why such a large gap?**\n\n- Requires sustained strength endurance (100 reps)\n\n- Technique breaks down under fatigue\n\n- Height disadvantage compounds over many reps\n\n- Mental challenge of high rep count\n\n**Training implication:** Even moderate Wall Ball improvements translate to significant time savings. A 20% improvement for a recreational athlete means saving ~90 seconds on this station alone.\n\n### RoxZone: The Hidden Time Drain\n\n**Time Variance:** Men 2:24, Women 1:48\n\nRoxZone - the cumulative time spent transitioning between stations - is the second-largest differentiator. Advanced athletes average ~21 seconds per transition (total ~5:45), while recreational athletes take ~30+ seconds (total ~8:10).\n\n**What's happening:**\n\n- Advanced athletes recover faster between efforts\n\n- Better movement efficiency and station setup\n\n- Less hesitation and quicker mental transitions\n\n- Superior cardiovascular fitness enables faster recovery\n\n**Training implication:** RoxZone improvements are \"free\" time savings - they require no additional fitness, just practice and efficiency. Saving 5 seconds per transition = 40 seconds total.\n\n### Burpee Broad Jumps: Technique + Power\n\n**Time Variance:** Men 1:47, Women 2:08\n\nThis station shows high variance, particularly for women (128 seconds difference). The combination of explosive power, coordination, and cardio endurance creates a challenging test that separates fitness levels.\n\n**Key factors:**\n\n- Burpee technique efficiency\n\n- Broad jump power and technique\n\n- Pace management over 80 meters\n\n- Fatigue resistance\n\n## Medium-Impact Stations\n\n**Sandbag Lunges** (1:27 variance), **Sled Pull** (1:16), and **Sled Push** (1:04) show moderate variance. These stations still offer improvement opportunities but to a lesser degree than the top three.\n\nThese stations are more \"democratized\" - recreational athletes can achieve respectable times with proper technique, even without elite fitness levels.\n\n## Low-Impact Stations: Less Leverage\n\n**Row** (0:28 variance), **Farmers Carry** (0:27), and **SkiErg** (0:23) show the smallest time differences between brackets. While you should still train these movements, they offer less leverage for time improvement compared to high-variance stations.\n\n**Why such small variance?**\n\n- More technique-dependent (skill matters more than pure fitness)\n\n- Shorter duration (less time to accumulate differences)\n\n- Equipment limits (can't go faster than machine/implement allows)\n\n- Natural movement patterns (less specialized)\n\n## What About Running?\n\nIt's important to note that while this analysis focuses on workout stations,\n\n**running is actually the largest component of HYROX** - accounting for approximately 50-55% of total race time. The variance in total running time between brackets is substantial (8+ minutes difference from 1:20 to 1:40).\n\nHowever, running improvement is a different beast - it's about aerobic base development, pacing strategy, and managing pace degradation across the race. We cover this in depth in our dedicated running analysis: The Mid-Race Crisis: When and Why You Slow Down.\n\n**The optimal approach:** Build your aerobic base through consistent running (the foundation), then layer in station-specific work focused on the high-variance stations identified above. You need both, but they're developed differently.\n\n## The 70/30 Training Strategy\n\nBased on this analysis, here's how to allocate your HYROX-specific training time:\n\n**70% of station-specific work:** **Wall Balls**- Technique, pacing, and endurance work **Transition Practice**- Mock RoxZone setups and practise compromised running **Burpee Broad Jumps**- Technique refinement and power development\n\n**30% of station-specific work:**\n\n4. Sled movements (Push/Pull)\n\n5. Sandbag Lunges\n\n6. Remaining stations (Row, Farmers, SkiErg)\n\nThis doesn't mean ignore the \"low-impact\" stations - it means prioritize your time wisely. A 10% improvement in Wall Balls saves you more time than a 20% improvement in SkiErg.\n\n## Priority Matrix: Your Action Plan\n\n|Priority Level|Stations|Total Potential Time Savings|\n|--|--|--|\n|High|Wall Balls, RoxZone, Burpee Broad Jumps|6-8 minutes|\n|Medium|Sandbag Lunges, Sled Pull, Sled Push|3-4 minutes|\n|Low|Row, Farmers Carry, SkiErg|1-2 minutes|\n#### Key Takeaway\n\nFocus your training on high-variance stations. Improving your Wall Balls by 90 seconds, tightening your RoxZone by 60 seconds, and shaving 45 seconds off Burpees could drop your total time by over 3 minutes - without improving your running at all.\n\n## Practical Application\n\n**For 1:30 athletes targeting 1:20:**\n\nYour biggest opportunities are Wall Balls (save over 1 min) and RoxZone (save over 1 min). Focus here first combined with aerobic capacity.\n\n**For 1:40 athletes targeting 1:30:**\n\nWall Balls (save ~1:15), RoxZone (save ~1:15), and Burpees (save ~1 min) offer the most potential in combination with aerobic capacity.\n\n**For all athletes:**\n\nTrack your split times for each station and compare them to your target bracket averages. Identify your worst 2-3 stations relative to the benchmark and make them training priorities.\n\n## Beyond the Numbers\n\nWhile this analysis reveals where time differences exist, remember that your individual strengths and weaknesses matter. If your Wall Balls are already competitive but your SkiErg is significantly slower than average, address your personal limiters first.\n\nUse this analysis as a framework for efficient training allocation, but personalize it based on your race results and current abilities.\n\n**Want more data-driven HYROX insights?** Subscribe to our newsletter for regular analysis and training strategies based on real race data.

The strength stations level the playing field between runners and strength athletes.\n\n### Common Athlete Profiles\n\n**The Runner**\n\n- 5K: 18-20 min\n\n- Strength training: Minimal\n\n- Expected HYROX: 1:30-1:40 (men), 1:50-2:00 (women)\n\n**Bottleneck:**Sled push (152kg/102kg), sled pull, wall balls\n\n**The CrossFitter**\n\n- 5K: 22-24 min\n\n- CrossFit: 3+ years\n\n- Expected HYROX: 1:25-1:35 (men), 1:40-1:50 (women)\n\n**Bottleneck:**Running endurance, pacing the 8km\n\n**The Balanced Athlete**\n\n- 5K: 20-22 min\n\n- Strength training: 2-3x/week\n\n- Expected HYROX: 1:20-1:30 (men), 1:35-1:45 (women)\n\n**Advantage:**No major weaknesses\n\nPure runners often overestimate their HYROX performance by 10-15 minutes, while CrossFitters underestimate theirs by 5-10 minutes. Train both equally for best results.\n\n## What Makes an Elite HYROX Time?\n\nBreaking into elite territory (\n\n**sub-1:15 men**, **sub-1:24 women**) requires four key elements:\n\n### Sub-5:00/km Running Pace\n\nElite athletes average\n\n**4:30-4:50/km** across all 8km of running, even when fatigued from stations.\n\n### Station Efficiency\n\n|Station|Elite Time (Men)|Elite Time (Women)|\n|--|--|--|\n|SkiErg (1000m)|3:50-4:20|4:30-5:00|\n|Sled Push (152kg/102kg)|2:50-3:26|2:50-3:25|\n|Sled Pull (103kg/78kg)|3:50-4:37|4:15-4:59|\n|Burpee Broad Jumps|4:00-4:37|5:15-5:57|\n|Row (1000m)|4:00-4:33|4:45-5:11|\n|Farmers Carry (48kg/32kg)|1:45-1:59|2:00-2:15|\n|Lunges (20kg/10kg)|3:50-4:24|4:00-4:30|\n|Wall Balls (100 reps)|5:30-6:04|5:20-5:53|\nOne bad station can cost you 5-10 minutes. Elite athletes have NO stations slower than 80th percentile\u2014they're well-rounded, not specialists.\n\n### Minimal RoxZone Time\n\nElite athletes average 4-5 minutes total RoxZone time. Intermediate athletes average 7-8.5 minutes, while beginners may take 9-12 minutes or more.\n\n**RoxZone includes:**\n\n- Running from finish line to station\n\n- Running from station to next start line\n\n- Brief mental prep and equipment setup\n\n### Mental Toughness\n\nThe ability to maintain pace when everything hurts. Elite athletes don't slow down\u2014they manage discomfort better.\n\n## How to Improve Your HYROX Time\n\nBased on your current level:\n\n### Beginners (1:40-2:10)\n\n**Focus:** Finish strong, build base fitness\n\n**Training priorities:**\n\n- Run 3-4x per week at conversational pace\n\n- Practice all 8 stations 1x per week\n\n- Focus on technique before speed\n\nDon't worry about speed yet.

Focus on improving YOUR time, not comparing yourself to elites. Every PR is worth celebrating.\n\n## FAQs\n\n**Q: What's the average HYROX finish time?**\n\nA: Men average around 1:40:00, women average around 1:54:00 across all age groups and divisions. The median (50th percentile) is slightly faster at 1:33-1:38 for men and 1:47-1:52 for women.\n\n**Q: Is sub 1:30 good for a first race?**\n\nA: Absolutely! Sub 1:30 for men puts you in the advanced category (top 30%). For women, sub 1:45 is also advanced level.\n\n**Q: How long does it take to go from beginner to elite?**\n\nA: Most athletes need 3-5 years of consistent, structured training. Expect 10-20% annual improvement in your first 2 years.\n\n**Q: Do pros use different weights?**\n\nA: No. Pro and Open athletes use the same weights (152kg sled push for men, 102kg for women). Only age group 60+ uses modified weights.\n\n**Q: Why are the sleds so heavy?**\n\nA: HYROX uses 152kg (men) and 102kg (women) for sled push to test strength-endurance. The heavy sleds separate pure runners from hybrid athletes.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions About HYROX Times\n\n### What is a good HYROX time for beginners?\n\nFor beginners, a good HYROX time is 1:40-1:54 for men and 1:54-2:10 for women. If you finish your first race in this range, you're performing better than about 50% of HYROX athletes. Focus on completing the race and building a baseline\u2014you can improve your times with targeted training.\n\n### What is the average HYROX time?\n\nThe average HYROX time for men is approximately 1:35, while women average around 1:50. However, this varies significantly by age group, with younger athletes (25-35) typically finishing 5-10 minutes faster than those in the 45-55 age bracket.\n\n### What HYROX time is considered elite?\n\nElite HYROX times are under 1:15 for men and under 1:26 for women. These times put you in the top 10% of all HYROX finishers globally and typically require years of focused training in both running and functional fitness.\n\n### How do HYROX times vary by age?\n\nHYROX times typically slow by 2-3 minutes per decade after age 35. A 1:30 time for a 25-year-old male would be equivalent to approximately 1:37 for a 45-year-old athlete with similar training. Our age group analysis shows detailed breakdowns by age bracket.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYour best time is one you're proud of. Whether you're chasing a PR, trying to beat a friend, or just finishing your first race\u2014every HYROX time represents hours of hard work.\n\nUse these benchmarks to set realistic goals and train smarter, not to judge your worth as an athlete.\n\n**Related Articles:**\n\n- Age Group Performance Analysis \u2014 Detailed age breakdown\n\n- Average Split Times by Age Group \u2014 Realistic benchmarks\n\n- First HYROX Race Guide \u2014 Complete beginner guide\n\n- How to Beat 1:30 \u2014 Complete training requirements\n\n",

          "snippet": "As I write this, in April 2022, Hunter McIntyre has just broken the HYROX world record in an incredible time of 55mins 09secs (update \u2013 he has since beaten that \u2013 you can see the list of up to date HYROX World Records here).\n\nAfter picking my jaw up off the floor at just how impressive this was, I started to wonder \u2013 considering all the data we have available to us \u2013 is there anything we can learn from the best of the best in the sport, other than just \u201cget fitter\u201d.\n\nIn the same way a non-league footballer might watch clips of Harry Kane to work out how he positions himself on the pitch, or a 28-handicap golfer might watch the type of shots Rory McIlroy plays around the green, all in an attempt to improve their performance, could there be anything that the average HYROX competitor might be able to pick up from the Elites of the competition?\n\nIs it just running they are primarily better at? Which of the functional exercises do they really excel at, and which are worthy our focus over and above some of the others? Are the Elites noticeably better on run 5 than run 8, or something along those lines?\n\nSo, I started to gather some data\u2026\n\n__The Method__\n\n__The Method__\n\nI\u2019ll say upfront, I\u2019m not a mathematician. There\u2019s a chance that any mathematicians reading this will have heart palpitations at just how flawed my methodology is. Maybe I should have used means instead of medians, or greater sample sizes. Maybe I lack statistical significance.\n\nI\u2019m also not at the Elite level in HYROX.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry as I\u2019m not going to be making any conclusions or giving any specific advice. If you want specific advice for your situation, check out our coaching options. Rather I\u2019ll just make some observations and raise some questions, that will hopefully help you in your own performance, training and race planning.\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s what I\u2019ve done\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve taken, from the HYROX leaderboard, 15 of the best HYROX performances ever \u2013 for both female and male at Pro level. I\u2019ve then taken the median of their times for each run and functional station. This group I\u2019m calling \u201c\n\n**Elite**\u201d.\n\nI repeated this for a sample of athletes who achieved a time broadly similar to what HYROX have said is the average time achieved at Pro level (roughly 90mins). This group I\u2019m calling \u201c\n\n**Average**\u201d.\n\nI\u2019ve deliberately avoided including any athlete more than once. For example, Hunter McIntyre has 5 of the top 10 times ever, at the time of writing, but I\u2019ve only included the fastest of those. I\u2019ve also avoided anyone who got a time penalty to avoid skewing the data.\n\n__The Findings__\n\n__The Findings__\n\nHere were the results\u2026\n\n|Men|Women|\n|--|--|\n|Elite|Average|Difference|Elite|Average|Difference|\n|Running 1|00:03:24|00:03:44|00:00:20|00:03:38|00:04:46|00:01:08|\n|Running 2|00:03:40|00:04:43|00:01:03|00:04:07|00:05:14|00:01:07|\n|Running 3|00:03:54|00:05:37|00:01:43|00:04:22|00:05:28|00:01:06|\n|Running 4|00:03:50|00:05:37|00:01:47|00:04:24|00:05:29|00:01:05|\n|Running 5|00:03:55|00:05:33|00:01:38|00:04:28|00:05:39|00:01:11|\n|Running 6|00:03:50|00:05:21|00:01:31|00:04:22|00:05:37|00:01:15|\n|Running 7|00:03:58|00:05:32|00:01:34|00:04:23|00:05:39|00:01:16|\n|Running 8|00:04:15|00:06:19|00:02:04|00:04:43|00:06:17|00:01:34|\n|Run Total|00:30:46|00:42:26|00:11:40|00:34:27|00:44:09|00:09:42|\n|1000m SkiErg|00:03:47|00:04:17|00:00:30|00:04:12|00:04:51|00:00:39|\n|2x25m Sled Push|00:02:45|00:03:40|00:00:55|00:03:00|00:03:48|00:00:47|\n|2x25m Sled Pull|00:03:14|00:06:31|00:03:17|00:03:54|00:06:36|00:02:42|\n|80m Burpee Broad Jump|00:02:21|00:05:15|00:02:54|00:03:11|00:04:53|00:01:42|\n|1000m Row|00:03:58|00:04:35|00:00:37|00:04:29|00:05:12|00:00:43|\n|200m Farmers Carry|00:01:37|00:02:32|00:00:55|00:01:57|00:02:45|00:00:48|\n|100m Sandbag Lunges|00:03:03|00:05:22|00:02:19|00:03:35|00:05:25|00:01:50|\n|Wall Balls|00:04:25|00:07:38|00:03:13|00:03:50|00:06:20|00:02:30|\n|Roxzone Time|00:02:54|00:06:58|00:04:04|00:03:47|00:06:12|00:02:25|\n|Total|00:58:50|01:29:14|00:30:24|01:06:22|01:30:11|00:23:49|\nYou can draw your own conclusions from that data if you wish but here\u2019s some of what I thought were potentially the most useful findings\u2026\n\n__Running__\n\n__Running__\n\nRunning is a large part of HYROX (it takes up 52% of the average elite race) and, surprise surprise, the Elites are better at running than the Average. Over the 8km in a HYROX race the men are nearly 12mins quicker and women nearly 10 mins quicker. Most people will have expected this, so I won\u2019t dwell on advising you just to become a faster runner. But it is, of course, important.\n\nI do, however, think it\u2019s worth pointing out that the Elites sampled run at an average pace of 3.51mins/km (men), or 4.18mins/km (women). I feel almost embarrassed to say this as I\u2019m nowhere near the standard of these athletes, but it is a running pace that I personally can get my head around. It\n\n*feels* achievable to do that (at least if I just look at the running portion in isolation).\n\nWhen Eliud Kipchoge ran a marathon in under 2 hours, his average splits were a pace of 2.51mins per km \u2013 for the length of a marathon. That I simply can\u2019t get my head around. But the Elites running pace in HYROX I (perhaps deludedly) can.\n\nIf we look at it in the context of world records for the Marathon, Half Marathon, and half distance Ironman (where the running portion is a half marathon, after a 1.9km swim and 90km bike ride), you can see the running split times are longer in HYROX, despite it being a shorter event\u2026\n\nOf course, that may not be a completely fair comparison. They are different events, HYROX has not been going for a long time (and we may eventually see much quicker running splits), and I\u2019m comparing World Records with an average of 15 Elite HYROX competitors. But I still think it has some relevance. And what I\u2019m really trying to stress is that you can still be very good at HYROX without being one of the world\u2019s best runners \u2013 there is more than just running for you to think about.\n\n**I suspect though that the Elite HYROX athletes are world class at compromised running.** To run that pace consistently through the race, after all the functional exercises, is very impressive. I wonder if Kipchoge could do that. Or even if Kipchoge could have got to the end of the race. Maybe he\u2019d have had to bail out at the sled push?! Who knows.\n\n**To summarise from a running perspective, improving your running is likely important if you want to move yourself closer to the Elite HYROX standard. But I don\u2019t think you need to be world class at running to be world class at HYROX. You do, however, need to be very good at compromised running, and have the endurance to sustain a solid running pace over an event that lasts 54mins+. In this article we talk more about compromised running and how to train for it.**\n\n__Pacing__\n\n__Pacing__\n\nIt feels to me as if the Elites may be better at pacing themselves than the average athlete, especially on the first run. This is certainly the case if we just look at the men \u2013 women don\u2019t seem to suffer so much with this problem.\n\nYou can see that the blue line is much flatter for the Elite men, indicating their run times are more consistent across the race. The first 1km run for the Average men (orange line), in particular, is much quicker than their average splits.\n\n** What impact could this be having on the rest of their race? Should they be conserving their energy better? **\n\nThe fact that women seem to be better at pacing themselves than men is no surprise. This study showed that women were 18.33% better than men at keeping an even pace in a marathon.\n\nIs pacing even important? In an event as long as HYROX, almost certainly. The consensus seems to be that for longer events (such as HYROX) not starting out too quickly is a sensible decision. For shorter distances, a faster start (to an extent) can be ok, but as most competitors are taking 60mins+ for HYROX, it is likely you want to be holding yourself back a little on the first couple of runs.\n\n**Could this be why the Average woman is much closer in time to an Elite Woman (23mins 49secs in our data), than an Average Man is to an Elite Man (30mins 24secs)? Click here to read our article on how to appropriately pace the running at HYROX. **\n\n__Ski Pace__\n\n__Ski Pace__\n\nIt\u2019s harder to gauge but I suspect the men are going a touch too quick on the SkiErg too, relative to their overall ability. The SkiErg has the smallest difference in times between Elite and Average competitors. This might be expected. However, as we know the men are almost certainly starting out too quickly on their first run, it\u2019s quite possible this is carrying over to the Ski as well (which is the first of the functional stations).\n\nThe men are 30 seconds slower on the Ski, and women are 39 secs slower. I know personally if I go maybe 5 secs/500m slower on the SkiErg, it significantly lowers my heart rate, even though that only equates to 10 seconds slower over 1km.\n\nIf you are able, I would suggest experimenting with your ski split times in training, and see how much better you feel if you go a little slower than you\u2019re planning to for your next race. What impact does an extra, say, 10 seconds on your 1km time do for your heart rate and how you feel afterwards? 10 seconds in the context of a HYROX, is a pretty small number, and could save you a greater amount of time in the remainder of the race.\n\n__Sled Push / Sled Pull__\n\n__Sled Push / Sled Pull__\n\nThe sled-based events at HYROX are the 2 main areas that benefit from an athlete\u2019s strength. So, you might expect the difference in times between the Average and Elite to be broadly similar on both the sled push and sled pull. But it\u2019s not. Average men are 55secs slower on push, and a whopping 3.17mins slower on the pull. The women are 47secs slower on push, and 2.42mins slower on the pull.\n\nLooked at another way, Elite men spend 18% longer on sled pull than their sled push, and Elite women spend 30% longer. But the Average spend 78% (men) or 74% (women) longer on the pull than the push!\n\nAs I see it, there are a few things to think about here:\n\n\u2013 Are Average athletes pushing too hard on the sled push, relative to their strength levels? And if so, could that be screwing them up for the rest of the race?\n\n\u2013 Or are the Average just much worse at the sled pull? In which case, working on technique, pull strength and posterior chain is very important.\n\n**For most people reading this, what the Average athlete is doing doesn\u2019t really matter. But could something similar be happening in your performance? Is your sled pull to sled push ratio similar to that of an Elite athlete? If not, could you be pushing too hard on the sled pull, or neglecting the work needed to improve your sled pull times?**\n\n__Roxzone__\n\n__Roxzone__\n\nAs hesitant as I\u2019ve been to give advice in this article, I will now break that and say one thing; If you want a good time, don\u2019t f*** about in the Roxzone!\n\nThe difference between the Elites and Averages in time spent in the Roxzone is quite startling. Average men spend 4.04mins longer in there, and Average women 2mins 25secs. That seems far too long.\n\nThe size of the Roxzone does vary by venue but I would roughly estimate it to be 800m on average. Therefore, it\u2019s a reasonable expectation for your Roxzone time to broadly be 80% of your average 1km split times. For Elites the data shows 75% (men) and 88% (Women). But for Average athletes it is 131% (men) and 112% (women)!\n\nThe Roxzone was certainly a bigger area than I\u2019d been expecting prior to my first event. Personally speaking, I suspect I subconsciously started to relax a little after each run as soon as I entered the Roxzone. It wasn\u2019t a conscious thing, but my Roxzone time of 6 minutes in my first race suggests that it was happening. That is something that the Elites never do. They stop running as soon as they are about to start the next exercise. And as soon as they\u2019ve finished it, they start again. Roxzone or running track are treated the same; for running on.\n\nOne enticing thing about the Roxzone is the drinks provided there. In a hot HYROX race it becomes very tempting to stop at the water table and sip on a cool drink before setting off again. The Elites may grab a water on the way past, but I doubt they are stopping for a relaxing beverage and a chat.\n\nTo be fair, as the Elites complete the race in a faster time, they have less need to take on as much water, so that may be a factor here, but it can\u2019t explain the difference entirely.\n\n**If you\u2019ve entered a HYROX in the past, have you spent too long in the Roxzone? How could you speed that up? Does the time you spent in the zone reasonably compare to how quickly you might run 800m(ish)? **\n\nGoing forward, I plan to think of the Roxzone as just another functional exercise but one I want to win. Rather than relax as I enter the Roxzone, its game on. In fact, as I write this, I\u2019m wondering if in I\u2019ll have a game of \u201cfloor is lava\u201d with myself where I imagine the floor in the Roxzone is lava and I have to get out of there as quickly as I can. Of course, it may mean I end up doing the runs or functional stations slower, but it\u2019s worth a go!\n\n__Summary__\n\n__Summary__\n\nThe data I\u2019ve gathered does show that Elites are better than the Average at\n\n__all__ the stations, and __all __the runs. That\u2019s probably to be expected. All areas are important in improving your times.\n\nAside from what\u2019s already been mentioned above, there is a particularly large difference in times on the Wall Balls and Burpee Broad Jumps, meaning these should likely be prioritised, for most people, over and above working on SkiErg and Rowing, for example (where the differences are much smaller).\n\nIt will obviously be different for each person, as we all have our own strengths and weaknesses, but to summarise where I think some of the\n\n*lowest hanging fruit* is in bringing an Average athlete closer to Elite level it would be:\n\n\u2013 Working on compromised running\n\n\u2013 Improved pacing (men especially)\n\n\u2013 Improved performance on the sled pull (with an aim to get your sled pull to sled push ratio more closely aligned with that of the Elites)\n\n\u2013 Reduced time in the Roxzone (bringing your Roxzone time to somewhere around 75-90% of your average 1km running time across the event)\n\nIf you\u2019d like any help with your performances in HYROX, we can\u2019t promise to make you Elite but we\u2019ll do our best to maximise your potential.

Athletes push a sled over 50 meters (2 x 25m), with weights stacked depending on the division.\n\nThe listed weight includes the sled (usually ~30\u201340 kg) plus added plates.\n\n**Open Women**: 102 kg **Pro Women**: 152 kg **Open Men**: 152 kg **Pro Men**: 202 kg\n\nTip: Traction and pushing form matter more than brute strength.\n\n## HYROX Sled Pull weight\n\nThe HYROX sled pull station uses the same sled as the sled push, but now you're pulling it 50 meters (2 x 25m) with arm and back strength.\n\nThe weights are slightly lower than the sled push.\n\n**Open Women**: 78 kg **Pro Women**: 103 kg **Open Men**: 103 kg **Pro Men**: 153 kg\n\nTrain with heavy rope pulls and seated row variations.\n\n## Farmers Carry HYROX Weights\n\nYou\u2019ll carry two kettlebells or dumbbells over a 200 meter course.\n\nCore and grip endurance are key for the HYROX farmers carry.\n\n**Open Women**: 2 \u00d7 16 kg **Pro Women**: 2 \u00d7 24 kg **Open Men**: 2 \u00d7 24 kg **Pro Men**: 2 \u00d7 32 kg\n\nPro tip: Keep shoulders back and walk tall to avoid fatigue.\n\n## HYROX Lunge weight\n\nThis 100-meter walking HYROX lunge with a sandbag on your back will test your legs and mental focus late in the race.\n\n**Open Women**: 10 kg **Pro Women**: 20 kg **Open Men**: 20 kg **Pro Men**: 30 kg\n\nNo dropping of the sandbag, try to make it one continuous effort.\n\n## HYROX Wall Ball weight\n\nThe race ends with HYROX wall balls: squat and throw to a target.\n\nThe weight and rep count depend on your category.\n\n**Open Women**: 100 reps with 4 kg to a 2.70 m target **Pro Women**: 100 reps with 6 kg to a 2.70 m target **Open Men**: 100 reps with 6 kg to a 3 m target **Pro Men**: 100 reps with 9 kg to a 3 m target\n\nAccuracy and pacing are critical here.\n\n## HYROX Cardio Standards: Running, SkiErg & RowErg\n\nWhile these HYROX stations don\u2019t have weights, they\u2019re just as crucial for your performance:\n\n**HYROX SkiErg**: 1000 meters **HYROX RowErg**: 1000 meters **HYROX Running**: 8 \u00d7 1,000 meters (one run between every station)\n\nThese distances are the same across all divisions (Open and Pro, men and women).\n\nTo perform well at the HYROX event, you\u2019ll need to move efficiently on each machine and pace your runs wisely. The perfect balance to perform as a great hybrid athlete.\n\n**SkiErg focus**: Smooth pulls, consistent breathing **RowErg focus**: Strong drive, relaxed return **Running focus**: Recovery pace early, acceleration in later rounds\n\n## Why HYROX weights matter\n\nTraining with the official HYROX weights is non-negotiable if you want to perform well on race day.\n\nEach station places a unique demand on your body, from explosive sled pushes to endurance-driven wall balls.

          "snippet": "## Jump to:\n\nThe increasing popularity of Hyrox means everyone is looking at ways they can improve their time. And with 8km of running and eight different stations interspersed throughout \u2013 not to mention the equally important 'Roxzone' \u2013 there's plenty of opportunities to both make up and lose time over the course of an event.\n\nBut how does your time compare to the average on the SkiErg, sled push or wall balls? Data compiled from both the pro and open divisions allows for simple comparison with your fellow competitors, while an expert currently at the top of the sport has offered his guidance on how to get faster.\n\n## What Is the Average Hyrox Finish Time for Men?\n\nAccording to RoxHype, the average Hyrox finish time across men of all ages in the pro division is 1:22:24 in 2025, with Alexander Roncevic's world record of 53:15 set in Hamburg 2025 blitzing that in remarkable fashion.\n\nWhen it comes to the open division, where weights are lighter and more accessible to men of all ages and abilities, the average finishing time is 1:26:42.\n\n## What Is the Average Time for Each Hyrox Station?\n\nWith Hyrox races featuring eight challenging stations, plus 8km of total running and even time in the Roxzone, there's plenty of variance between the pro and open divisions. These are the average times it takes men to complete all the stations in each division:\n\n## How to Improve Your Hyrox Time\n\nJake Dearden is a world record holder in the pro doubles division, setting a time of 50:04 alongside James Kelly. He also competes individually in the Elite 15. While running accounts for 50% of the race, and has to be a key area of focus for anyone wanting to get quicker, Dearden offers the following tips to improve across the board.\n\n## 1. Pace Yourself\n\nDespite the intense nature of a Hyrox, it epitomises the cliche of being a 'marathon not a sprint'. Yes, you will have plenty of energy as you start your first kilometre run. But no, that doesn't mean you should try and complete it as quickly as possible.\n\n'Think about a race in order of importance, so starting off with your SkiErg [the first workout station] \u2013 that\u2019s the most important exercise,' Dearden notes. 'If your heart rate skyrockets at the ski and you struggle, that\u2019s going to fatigue you for the rest of the race. But if you get fatigued at the burpees [the fourth station], you\u2019ve had a good first half of the race. You need to focus on these things in order of importance, but don\u2019t neglect any of them. If your wall balls really suffer, work on them.'\n\n## 2. Run Fatigued\n\nIt's all well and good being a strong runner, but if you're unable to keep cycling your legs after 100m of sandbag lunges, then you're always going to struggle. 'I always look at the [workout station] and the run as one exercise, so if you\u2019re a strength athlete and you\u2019re amazing at the sled push, look at your sled push and your running time after as one exercise,' Dearden says.\n\n'You might be really good at the sled push, but then your running might drop off a cliff. If you\u2019re a stronger athlete and you\u2019re not very good at running, you need to get better at it. You can\u2019t neglect anything.'\n\n## 3. The 'Roxzone' Is Equally Important\n\nThe area between the running track and the individual stations, the Roxzone offers athletes a chance for a breather \u2013 but try not to lean too far into the transitionary phase it feels like. As Dearden points out, this is a race and the clock never stops, 'from the minute you start to the minute you cross the finish line there's no dead time, so make sure that you are moving at\n\n*all* times'.\n\n## 4. Fuel Properly\n\nCarbohydrates provide essential energy to perform at your best come race day, so don't worry about dieting down just so you have visible abs in the run up to the event. 'Realistically, Hyrox is an endurance event, but it's one where we're working at a really high heart rate for the majority of the race,' Dearden says. 'We're probably working at 80 to 90% of our thresholds throughout, which to be clear, requires carbohydrates'.\n\n## 5. Nothing New on Race Day\n\nFor those of you that have ever run a half or full marathon, this phrase will sound familiar. While this generally relates to keeping your nutrition and hydration the same \u2013 and wearing shoes or clothing that you know will stay comfortable after over an hour of vigorous exercise \u2013 it also means not going much quicker on the SkiErg than you're used to, just because you feel good and the adrenaline is getting the better of you.\n\n'Whatever you do in training, that's what you do on race day,' advises Dearden. 'Don't do anything new. Don't be looking at the person next to you or looking at the elite athletes and copying what they do, because that might not work.'\n\nRyan Dabbs\n\nRyan is a Senior Writer at\n\n*Men\u2019s Health* *UK* with a passion for storytelling, health and fitness.

Within this first scientific study on Hyrox^\u00a9^, acute physiological responses, relative perceived exertion (RPE), and possible performance determinants were assessed during a simulated Hyrox^\u00a9^ competition to derive training recommendations and potential practical applications.\n\n### Methods\n\nEleven recreational Hyrox^\u00a9^ athletes [27% women, Hyrox^\u00a9^ experience median (interquartile range): 18 (19) months] participated. In a pre-test, height, body composition, hand grip strength (HGS), maximum oxygen consumption (VO~2~max), and volume of resistance and endurance training were assessed. After 48 h rest, a simulated Hyrox^\u00a9^ was conducted according to the competition-standards of the \u201cIndividual Open Division\u201d. Heart rate (HR) was tracked throughout the Hyrox^\u00a9^. Blood lactate (BL) and RPE were recorded at the beginning and after each run and exercise station. Differences between runs and exercise stations for HR, BL, and RPE were analyzed via Wilcoxon signed rank test. Spearman\u2019s rank correlation test was conducted to identify associations between completion times (Hyrox^\u00a9^, runs, exercise stations) and participant characteristics. Values are given as median (interquartile range).\n\n### Results\n\nCompletion time of the Hyrox^\u00a9^ was 86.5 (14.5) minutes, whereby runs (51.2 (14.1) minutes) were significantly longer than the exercise stations [32.8 (6.1) minutes] (p = 0.003). Most of the Hyrox^\u00a9^ was performed at very hard and hard intensities [79.5 (21)% and 19.6 (20.7)% of maximum HR]. Maximum BL was higher during the exercise stations [8.5 (5.4) mmol/L] compared to the runs (7.7 (4.6) mmol/L) (p = 0.006). Similar results were found for maximum RPE [exercise stations: 18 (2), runs: 16 (2), p = 0.003]. The highest values for HR, BL, and RPE occurred during the last exercise (wall balls). The exercise stations with the heaviest loads were completed the fastest [sled push: 128 (34) seconds, sled pull: 155 (38) seconds]. Faster Hyrox^\u00a9^ completion correlated significantly with higher VO~2~max (p = 0.01), greater endurance training volume (p = 0.04), and lower body fat percentage (p = 0.03).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nHyrox^\u00a9^ is a HIFT modality with an emphasis on endurance capacity and moderate to low requirements in terms of maximum strength, coordination, and mobility when compared to other forms HIFT. Hyrox^\u00a9^ may be suitable for health promotion and tactical population training.\n\n**Keywords:** fitness racing, HIFT, concurrent training, high intensity interval training, heart rate, maximum oxygen consumption, lactate, relative perceived exertion\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nHigh-intensity interval training (HIIT), strength training with free weights, bodyweight training, and functional fitness training (FFT) have been ongoing trends for years and were among the top 10 trends in the fitness industry in 2023 (Thompson, 2023). Fitness racing such as Hyrox^\u00a9^ (Upsolut Sports GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) is a new fitness domain combining elements of these training modalities in a comprehensive competition format (Bergmann, 2024). Similar to CrossFit^\u00a9^ (CF) (CrossFit, Inc., Washington, DC, United States) \u2013 one of the most popular FFT concepts \u2013 Hyrox^\u00a9^ also incorporates elements of gymnastics, weightlifting, and endurance sports (Glassman, 2020). In contrast to CF, a Hyrox^\u00a9^ competition always consists of the same 8 exercises (ski ergometer, sled push, sled pull, burpee broad jump, rowing ergometer, farmers carry, sandbag lunges, and wall balls) and 8 runs [each 1,000 meters (m)]. Runs and exercises are completed alternately one after the other, whereby the competition always starts with a run. Weights and distances of the exercises are adjusted based on gender, division, and mode (e.g., Individual Open, Individual Pro, Double, Relay), allowing athletes of varying fitness levels to participate. The first Hyrox^\u00a9^ competition took place in 2017. Considering that in the 2022/2023 season already 90,000 Hyrox^\u00a9^ athletes worldwide competed despite the corona pandemic, a further increase in popularity could be expected (Bergmann, 2024). Nevertheless, Hyrox^\u00a9^ is not represented in the scientific literature up to date. Accordingly, little is known about acute physiological responses and performance determinants. However, this information is essential for developing effective training programs and exploring potential application areas of Hyrox^\u00a9^ beyond competitive sport. Indeed, previous research on other sports respectively training concepts that appear to be closely related to Hyrox^\u00a9^ such as CF, concurrent training (CT), and running may provide some insight in this regard.\n\nLooking at CF, there is a considerable amount of research providing information for coaches, athletes, and health professionals in terms of physiological and psychological demands, performance predictors, injury rates, health benefits, and motivational aspects (Claudino et al., 2018; Dexheimer et al., 2019; \u00c1ngel Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2022; Brandt et al., 2024; Dominski et al., 2021). Regarding health and fitness, previous research showed that CF improves cardiovascular fitness, body composition, mobility, strength, and back health, while being associated with a low injury risk (1.9 \u2013 3.2 injuries per 1000 hours [h]) (Gianzina and Kassotaki, 2019; Brandt et al., 2024; Hak et al., 2013). In terms of performance, it was demonstrated that a lower body fat percentage, higher total body strength, and maximum oxygen consumption (VO~2~max) correlated with better CF performance (Meier et al., 2023a). However, the investigated CF workouts (e.g., Fran, Cindy, Isabel, Murph) were considerably shorter than a Hyrox^\u00a9^ competition (Ahmad et al., 2018; Rios et al., 2024a; Rios et al., 2024b; Carreker and Grosicki, 2020). The single study on physiological demands covering longer bouts of CF was conducted over the course of regular 60-minute [min] CF training sessions (Meier et al., 2023b). This limits the extent to which conclusions could be derived about the physiological demands of Hyrox^\u00a9^. Unlike CF, which emphasizes constantly varied functional movements, Hyrox^\u00a9^ places a greater focus on running, with a total of 8 kilometers [km] per competition and less exercise variety (Bergmann, 2024; Glassman, 2020).\n\nOn endurance exercise such as running, extensive research has been carried out in a large number of different populations with regard to physiological demands, health benefits, or injury patterns. Performance in Olympic endurance events is typically achieved at intensities exceeding 85% of the VO~2~max. Joyner and Coyle concluded that endurance athletes need to be relatively fatigue resistant at intensities that stimulate significant anaerobic metabolism (Joyner and Coyle, 2008). The most important factors especially for running performance therefore include maximal oxygen uptake (VO~2~max), lactate threshold, and running economy (Joyner, 1991). Regarding health benefits, a meta-analysis with a pooled sample of N = 232,149 participants showed that running is associated with a 27%, 30%, and 23% reduced risk of all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality (Pedisic et al., 2020). Lee et al. stated that, from a public health perspective, running could be the most cost-effective lifestyle medicine, exceeding the importance of risk factors like smoking, obesity, hypertension, or diabetes (Lee et al., 2017). Nevertheless, running is associated with an injury risk of 6.8\u201359 injuries per 1,000 h whereby history of previous injuries, mileage but also training volume and frequency need to be considered to prevent injury (Saragiotto et al., 2014; Fields et al., 2010). While research on endurance exercise \u2013 and in particular running \u2013 provides indications regarding the demands and effects of Hyrox^\u00a9^, the specific characteristics of Hyrox^\u00a9^ (e.g., integration of functional exercises) might lead to divergent findings.\n\nBesides running, Hyrox^\u00a9^ includes exercises such as sled pushes (men: 202 kilograms [kg], women: 152 kg) and sled pulls (men: 153 kg, women: 103 kg) where heavy external weights need to be moved (Bergmann, 2024). This suggests that Hyrox^\u00a9^ training regimes should also include resistance training to some extent. Notably, resistance training may not only improve competition performance but health (e.g., reducing cardiovascular disease, hypertension, all-cause-mortality, and the offset of age-related declines in strength, power, and muscle mass) (Fyfe et al., 2022). Nevertheless, implementation of additional strength training needs to be done with caution because volume and frequency are critical risk factors for injury (Saragiotto et al., 2014; Fields et al., 2010). Furthermore, previous research in the field of CT showed that combining resistance and endurance training poses a challenge, as the specific adaptations from each type of training may potentially interfere with one another. Therefore, to manage overall fatigue, reduce negative interferences, and avoid injuries, knowing the specific demands of Hyrox^\u00a9^ in terms of strength and endurance capacity is essential according to CT research (Methenitis, 2018; Wilson et al., 2012).\n\nHowever, no scientific studies to date have investigated Hyrox^\u00a9^ in this respect, making it difficult to develop evidence-based training programs or identify potential benefits and practical applications beyond competitive sports. Therefore, this study analyzed the acute physiological responses as well as potential performance predictors in Hyrox^\u00a9^ athletes during a simulated Hyrox^\u00a9^ competition.\n\n## 2 Materials and methods\n\n### 2.1 Trial overview\n\nThis study was conducted at the University of the Bundeswehr Munich (UniBw M). Participants attended 2 separate test sessions \u2013 a pre-test and a simulated Hyrox^\u00a9^ competition. The simulated Hyrox^\u00a9^ was performed 2\u201314 days after the pre-test. The Institutional Ethics Committee of the UniBw M approved the study protocol, ensuring that it conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study (08.02.2024; EK UniBw M 24-05). An overview of the trial is displayed in Figure 1.\n\n### 2.2 Participants\n\nThe study involved recreational Hyrox^\u00a9^ athletes (N = 11, 27% women, Hyrox^\u00a9^ experience: 18 (19) months) who were at least 18 years old and had participated in at least one official Hyrox^\u00a9^ competition prior to the study. Exclusion criteria were health issues that would preclude participation in the applied tests (e.g., cardiovascular diseases, respiratory disorders, severe injuries to the musculoskeletal system, osteoporosis, intervertebral disc damage, joint replacements, hypertension). No adverse events occurred during the test sessions. Participant characteristics are displayed in Table 1.\n\n#### TABLE 1.\n\nCharacteristics of participants.\n\n|Parameter|Median|IQR|Min|Max|\n|--|--|--|--|--|\n|N|11| | | |\n|Male (N) Female (N) Diverse|72.7% (8) 27.3% (3) 0%| | | |\n|Age [years]|33|9|23|43|\n|Body mass [kg]|71.6|20.5|62.4|108.5|\n|BMI [kg/m^2^]|24.2|4.6|23.3|30.6|\n|Body fat [%]|21.3|7.3|10.7|25|\n|Muscle mass [%]|37.7|4.6|34.5|40.8|\n|Hand grip strength [kg]|51.1|10.7|35.1|73.3|\n|VO~2~max [mL/min/kg]|51|10.8|46.6|72|\n|HR~max~ [bpm]|186|24|166|201|\n|Hyrox^\u00a9^ experience [months]|18|19|2|48|\n|Endurance training [hours/week]|3|2.5|2|7|\n|Resistance training [hours/week]|4|3|1|7|\n\nAbbreviations: BMI, body mass index; bpm, beats per minute; HR~max~, maximum heart rate; kg, kilograms; m, meter; mL, milliliter; min, minute; IQR, interquartile range; VO~2~max, maximum rate of oxygen consumption.\n\n### 2.3 Procedure\n\n#### 2.3.1 Pre-test\n\nThe aim of the pre-test was to collect measures of body composition, strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, and training status. Participants were instructed to avoid any intensive physical activity 48 h, alcohol consumption 24 h, and food intake 3 h prior the test. Moreover, they should not drink more than 500 mL of water 30 min before the measurement and empty their bladder. The pre-test comprised a questionnaire, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), hand grip strength (HGS) test, and cardiopulmonary exercise test on a treadmill (CPET).\n\n##### 2.3.1.1 Questionnaire\n\nParticipants were asked for their gender and age [years], hours of resistance as well as endurance training per week [h/wk], and Hyrox^\u00a9^ experience in months.\n\n##### 2.3.1.2 Body composition and height\n\nHeight [cm], weight [kg], and body composition (body fat percentage [%] and muscle mass percentage [%]) were measured in underwear. Height was assessed with a SECA\u00ae 213 (seca GmbH and Co. KG, Hamburg, Germany) and body composition with a SECA\u00ae mBCA 515 scale (seca GmbH and Co. KG, Hamburg, Germany). According to Bosy-Westphal et al., the SECA\u00ae mBCA 515 is a valid and precise tool to estimate body composition (Bosy-Westphal et al., 2017; Bosy-Westphal et al., 2013).\n\n##### 2.3.1.3 Hand grip strength test\n\nHGS was measured with the Baseline\u00ae Smedley Digital hand-held dynamometer (Fabrication Enterprises, New York, United States) and given in kg. For the measurement, participants sat upright on a chair with their feet on the ground and a 90\u00b0 angle in their knee joint. The elbow was flexed at 90\u00b0 with the fingertips pointed ventrally and the palm facing medially. Starting with the dominant hand, participants were instructed to squeeze the dynamometer as hard as they could for 5 seconds [sec]. Each hand was measured thrice with 30 s of rest between trials, whereby the highest of all 6 measures was used for the analysis. HGS strongly correlates with strength in other muscle groups and can be used as a predictor for total muscle strength (Wind et al., 2010). Furthermore, since Hyrox^\u00a9^ is a fitness racing modality including exercises that require athletes to hold and pull external loads during sled pulls and farmers carry, HGS could influence performance.\n\n##### 2.3.1.4 Cardiopulmonary exercise test\n\nThe participants performed an incremental exercise test on a h/p/cosmos pulsar\u00ae 3p treadmill (h/p/cosmos, Traunstein, Germany). Women started at 6 km/h and men at 7 km/h, both at an incline of 1%. The speed was increased by 1 km/h every 3 min until participants were unable to maintain running pace. As proposed by Rosenerger and Schommer, exhaustion criteria comprised a respiratory exchange ratio >1.1, plateauing of VO~2~ consumption, and a HR reaching or exceeding 100% \u00b1 10% of the age-predicted HR~max~ (Scharhag-Rosenberger and Schommer, 2013). Heart rate (HR) was continuously tracked with a smartLAB hrm W sensor worn at the chest (HMM Diagnostics GmbH, Heddesheim, Germany). To assess cardiopulmonary indices the COSMED Quark CPET (COSMED, Rome, Italy) was used. VO~2~max [mL/min/kg] was determined by averaging the oxygen uptake over the last 30 s at the participant\u2019s peak performance.\n\n#### 2.3.2 Simulated Hyrox \u00a9 competition\n\nIn the simulated Hyrox^\u00a9^ competition test, physiological responses were assessed in order to estimate the demands of a Hyrox^\u00a9^ competition. Participants were instructed to avoid any intensive physical activity 48 h prior the test. All participants completed the Hyrox^\u00a9^ according to the standards of the \u201cIndividual Open Division\u201d. The exercise execution followed the guidelines outlined for Hyrox^\u00a9^ competitions (Bergmann, 2024). Each participant completed the test alone in a gym. The 8 runs and exercise stations were performed in alternating order, always starting with a 1 km run on a Woodway Curve treadmill (WOODWAY, Weil am Rhein, Germany). The exercise stations were (1) ski ergometer (1000 m; Concept2, Morrisville, USA), (2) sled push (4 \u00d7 12.5m, women: 102 kg, men: 152 kg, including weight of the sled) (3) sled pull (4 \u00d7 12.5m, women: 78 kg, men: 103 kg, including weight of the sled), (4) burpee broad jumps (4 \u00d7 20 m), (5) rowing ergometer (1000 m; Concept2, Morrisville, USA), (6) farmers carry (8 \u00d7 25 m, women: 2 \u00d7 16 kg kettle bell, men: 2 \u00d7 24 kg kettle bell), (7) sandbag lunges (4 \u00d7 25 m, women: 10 kg, men: 20 kg), and (8) wall balls (women: 75 repetitions with 4 kg, men: 100 repetitions with 6 kg). Participants were instructed to complete the Hyrox^\u00a9^ as fast as possible. The test setup in the gym is shown in Figure 2.\n\nTest setup for the simulated Hyrox^\u00a9^ competition.\n\nThe completion times were recorded for the full Hyrox^\u00a9^, the accumulated runs, the accumulated exercise stations as well as for each run and exercise station. During the test, the participants wore a smartLAB hrm W sensor at the chest (HMM Diagnostics GmbH, Heddesheim, Germany) to track their HR. The maximum heart rate (HR~max~) and average HR (HR~avg~) was determined for the complete Hyrox^\u00a9^, as well as for the accumulated runs, accumulated exercise stations, and each individual run and exercise station. The relative HR [%HR~max~] was calculated to the second for the entire Hyrox^\u00a9^ to estimate the exercise intensity according to the guidelines of the American College of Sports Medicine (very light, light, moderate, hard, very hard, maximum) (Pollock et al., 1998).\n\nBlood lactate concentration (BL) in millimoles per liter [mmol/L] was measured with a Lactate Scout+ (SensLab GmbH, Leipzig, Germany) before the test, after each run, after each exercise station, and at 3 and 6 min after the completion of the final exercise station. Simultaneously with the lactate measurements, relative perceived exertion (RPE) was assessed using the Borg scale (scale from 6\u201320 with 6 being the lowest and 20 the highest possible perceived exertion). The scale was presented and explained to the participants beforehand, following the standards for its use in sports medicine as recommended by L\u00f6llgen (Borg, 1998; L\u00f6llgen, 2004). The maximum BL (BL~max~), maximum RPE (RPE~max~), average BL (BL~avg~), and average RPE (RPE~avg~) was determined for the complete Hyrox^\u00a9^, as well as for the accumulated runs, and accumulated exercise stations.\n\n### 2.4 Statistical analysis\n\nThe statistical analysis was conducted with Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, United States) and SPSS 29\u00ae (IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY, United States). Normal distribution was analyzed via Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Q-Q-plots. Values are given as median (interquartile range). Differences between the runs and workout stations in terms of physiological responses and RPE were analyzed via Wilcoxon signed rank test. The effect size r was calculated based on the z-value and the sample size. Spearman\u2019s rank correlation test was performed to identify associations between the completion times (complete Hyrox^\u00a9^, runs, exercise stations) and participant characteristics (e.g., measures of body composition, strength, and endurance). Spearman\u2019s rho was reported as the correlation coefficient. Statistical significance was set at p \u2264 0.05.\n\n## 3 Results\n\nParticipants completed the Hyrox^\u00a9^ in 86.5 (14.5) min, whereby the time spent running [51.2 (14.1) min] was significantly longer than the time to complete the exercise stations [32.8 (6.1) min] (p = 0.003, r = 0.88). The percentage share of the specific exercise stations and runs in the total time to completion is displayed in Figure 3. The shortest median times to completion occurred for sled push [2.1 (0.6) min], sled pull [2.6 (0.6) min], and farmers carry [2.7 (0.7 min]. Run 5 [7.4 (1.6) min], Run 8 [6.8 (1.3) min], and Run 6 [6.8 (1.9) min] took participants the longest.\n\nDistribution of the time spent completing the exercise stations and runs during the simulated Hyrox^\u00a9^ competition.\n\nDuring the Hyrox, participants achieved a HR~max~ of 185 (26) bpm, with significantly higher values for the exercise stations [185 (26) bpm] compared to the runs [180 (26) bpm] (p = 0.04, r = 62). Similarly, the HR~avg~ in the full Hyrox^\u00a9^ reached 170.9 (21.2) bpm while participants completed the exercise stations at a higher HR~avg~ (173.7 (19.5) bpm) compared to the runs [168.9 (21.9) bpm] (p = 0.03, r = 64). Most of the time, participants performed at very hard [79.5 (21) %] and hard [19.6 (20.7) %] intensities. The distribution of the intensity ranges is shown in Figure 4.\n\nPercentage of time spent in different intensity ranges during the simulated Hyrox^\u00a9^competition. Note: Intensity ranges were determined based on the percentage of participants\u2019 maximum heart rate (very light: <35%, light: 35%\u201355%, moderate: 55%\u201370%, hard: 70%\u201390%, very hard: 90%\u2013100%, maximum = 100%).\n\nPhysiologically, the hard to very hard intensity was also reflected in the values for BL~max~ [8.5 (5.4) mmol/L] during the Hyrox^\u00a9^. Again, BL~max~ was significantly higher after the exercise stations [8.5 (5.4) mmol/L] compared to the runs [7.7 (4.6) mmol/L] (p = 0.006, r = 83). Looking at BL~avg~ during the Hyrox^\u00a9^ [6.3 (3.8) mmol/L], the values after the workouts [6.6 (3.7) mmol/L] were higher in comparison to the runs [6.2 (3.9) mmol/L] (p = 0.003, r = 0.88).\n\nThe RPE~max~ score during the Hyrox^\u00a9^ reached 18 (2), whereby the participants rated the exercise stations [18 (2)] as significantly more strenuous than the runs [16 (2)] (p = 0.003, r = 0.91). Likewise, participants had a RPE~avg~ of 14.1 (1.5) in the Hyrox^\u00a9^, with significantly higher values during the exercise stations [14.4 (1.9)] compared to the runs [13.4 (1.3)] (p = 0.003, r = 0.89).

They further had sufficient strength to execute all exercise station with the competition-standard loads.\n\n## 4 Discussion\n\n### 4.1 Classification and physiological demands of Hyrox \u00a9\n\nThe observed physiological responses and RPE clearly illustrated the high-intensity nature of Hyrox^\u00a9^ (Pollock et al., 1998). Given that Hyrox^\u00a9^ comprises multi-joint, compound movements performed at high intensities, with loads reaching up to 152 kg for women and 202 kg for men, Hyrox^\u00a9^ can be classified as a HIFT modality (Feito et al., 2018). Since more than 60% of the total completion time was spent running, Hyrox^\u00a9^ should be further specified as a running-focused form of HIFT.\n\nBased on the overall duration [86.5 (14.5) min] in conjunction with HR and BL values, it is to assume that participants had to rely on both aerobic as well as anaerobic metabolic pathways to complete the Hyrox^\u00a9^. Compared to the runs, the exercise stations were significantly more intense indicating higher energy demands per time. In this regard, it is to note that the exercise stations with the heaviest external loads (sled push and sled pull) were completed the fastest. Median completion times of these movements still ranged between 2\u20133 min indicating that Hyrox^\u00a9^ requires athletes to exert a considerable amount of force over prolonged periods of time with anaerobic glycolysis being a key contributor to energy production during these phases. The importance of anaerobic energy production was also confirmed for other HIFT domains such as CF. However, Fernandez et al. and Forte et al. reported considerably higher BL values for CF workouts (mean \u00b1 standard deviation: up to 15.8 \u00b1 4.9 mmol/L) (Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2015; Forte et al., 2022). This is in line with recent findings of Sousa Neto et al. who investigated physiological responses after the CF benchmark workout \u201cKaren\u201d (150 repetitions of wall balls with a 9 kg ball as fast as possible) and found significant increases of BL reaching even higher values 17.5 \u00b1 3 mmol/L) (Sousa Neto et al., 2022). Nevertheless, most of the investigated CrossFit^\u00a9^ workouts were shorter than 20 min (Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2015; Forte et al., 2022; Sousa Neto et al., 2022). One exception might be the CF workout Murph, in which physiological responses similar to Hyrox^\u00a9^ were observed (HR~max~ = 185.6 \u00b1 7.6 bpm, HR~avg~ = 168.8 \u00b1 6.4 bpm, and BL = 10 \u00b1 3 mmol/L). However, Murph was completed substantially faster (43.4 \u00b1 4.6 min) and classified by shorter running distance (2 miles) and time (17.6 \u00b1 2 min) leading to divergent demands for the athletes (Carreker and Grosicki, 2020).\n\nOn the other hand, unlike HIFT modalities such as CF where athletes are prepared for \u201cthe unknown and unknowable,\u201d exercises but also the loads being moved in Hyrox^\u00a9^ competitions are fixed (Bergmann, 2024; Glassman, 2020). This suggests that once strength and power exceed a certain level, benefits of further improvements in these parameters might diminish. Contrastingly, the importance of muscular endurance (e.g., utilizing, tolerating, and clearing lactate) could become more prominent in order to sustain the repeated high-intensity efforts. In this context, it is worth mentioning that the various movements performed in Hyrox^\u00a9^ involve the upper as well as lower body musculature (Bergmann, 2024). It is therefore to assume, that both the transition between fatiguing upper-body-dominant as well as lower-body-dominant movements and running inhibits running performance and requires specific adaptions (e.g., redistribution of blood to the legs after movements involving large amounts of upper body musculature; running after high lactate accumulation in the legs due to lower-body-dominant movements). Running under such circumstances could have negatively affected running technique respectively economy which is highly relevant to achieve high running speeds. This could explain the relatively low running pace during the Hyrox^\u00a9^ compared to that observed in recreational half-marathon runners (Ogueta-Alday et al., 2018). Therefore, economizing the transition between different metabolic demands as well as maintaining efficient technical execution under fatigue seem to be important aspects for Hyrox^\u00a9^ athletes. This is in line with the findings of Peeling et al., who showed that swimming at too high an intensity has detrimental effects on subsequent cycling performance as well as overall performance in triathletes (Peeling et al., 2005). Similarly, Ribiero et al. reported lower overall performance in the CF workout \u201cFight Gone Bad\u201d when participants completed it in all-out pacing compared to a controlled-split pacing strategy (Ribeiro et al., 2024).\n\nIn comparison to endurance sports (e.g., running, cycling, rowing, swimming), Hyrox^\u00a9^ athletes need to excel in a greater variety of movement patterns and components of physical fitness (Bergmann, 2024). However, compared to CF, the degree of variation in terms of movements, distances, and loads, the technical demands appear to be relatively low (Bergmann, 2024; Glassman, 2020). This was also displayed by the fact that all participants were able to perform the movements according to Hyrox^\u00a9^ competition standards without any scaling. It can therefore be assumed that as performance level and technical proficiency increase, the optimization of metabolic adaptations and proper pacing becomes increasingly important for Hyrox^\u00a9^ athletes.\n\n### 4.2 Performance determinants\n\nThe correlation analyses were in line with the assumptions drawn from the observed physiological responses and RPE. Strong correlations with VO~2~max suggested that aerobic capacity could be an important performance determinant for Hyrox^\u00a9^ athletes. This was also evident in previous research investigating half-marathon runners as well as CF athletes (Meier et al., 2023a; Nikolaidis and Knechtle, 2023). The proximity to CF and running disciplines was further reflected in the strong correlations between the completion times of the Hyrox^\u00a9^ and runs with body fat percentage (Meier et al., 2023a; Nikolaidis and Knechtle, 2023). However, in contrast to CF, where measures of muscular strength were found to be important performance determinants, neither HGS nor muscle mass percentage correlated with performance in the present study (Meier et al., 2023a). This was also reflected in the lack of correlation between resistance training and completion times. On the other hand, endurance training volume was strongly associated with completion times of the Hyrox^\u00a9^ as well as the runs. However, more information regarding training parameters (e.g., volume, intensity, exercise selection, training history) would be required to better estimate the relevance of resistance and endurance training. Furthermore, only maximum HGS but no direct assessment of lower body strength or strength endurance was conducted.\n\n### 4.3 Training recommendations\n\nWhen training for a Hyrox^\u00a9^, a broad training strategy needs to be applied. According to the observations in the present study, endurance training should to be emphasized to perform a Hyrox^\u00a9^ at hard to very hard intensities. Hyrox^\u00a9^ training programs should therefore include endurance activities at moderate intensities as well as forms of HIIT to improve aerobic as well as anaerobic capacity. Since athletes spent the majority of time running, a substantial amount of training volume has to be dedicated to running-based training sessions. However, excessive running mileage has been shown to increase the injury risk and should be treated with caution (Fields et al., 2010). A strategy to avoid running-related overuse or injury would be to replace or combine running with other Hyrox^\u00a9^ specific endurance activities such as rowing or skiing (Bergmann, 2024). Infact, combining running with other Hyrox^\u00a9^ movements should be an integral part of Hyrox^\u00a9^ training to improve running economy in a pre-fatigued state and the ability to transition between different metabolic demands.\n\nAlthough strength appeared to be less important, athletes still need to be able to move external weights according to the competition standards. Previous research on CT indicated that endurance and resistance training may interfere with each other, affecting overall adaptations. To minimize interference, Methenitis recommended separating resistance and endurance training into distinct sessions. When endurance and resistance training have to be done in the same session, the most important aspect should be trained first. In case of athletes that substantially lack maximum strength, power, or muscular endurance to handle competition-standard loads, a training cycle focusing on resistance training could be utilized. For optimal resistance training adaptations, a ratio of 2:1 or 3:1 (resistance: endurance training) in terms of training frequency is recommended. On the other hand, optimal endurance training adaptions should be achieved with a ratio of 1:1 or 1:2 (resistance: endurance training) (Methenitis, 2018). Due to the high-intensity nature of Hyrox^\u00a9^, an efficient training method for Hyrox^\u00a9^ athletes should be HIIT as it effectively improves measures of endurance such as VO~2~max and leads to less interference effects compared with high-volume, moderate-intensity endurance training (Methenitis, 2018; Mallol et al., 2019). Furthermore, by incorporating Hyrox^\u00a9^ exercises and running within a HIIT-style endurance protocol, multiple training objectives could be achieved within a single session and thus minimize overall fatigue. Such training protocols would closely mirror the demands of a Hyrox^\u00a9^ competition, possibly enabling athletes to refine transitions between exercises, enhance movement efficiency, and adapt to the specific metabolic demands of Hyrox^\u00a9^. While findings of this study allowed for several general training recommendations, assessing individual capabilities and circumstances remains detrimental to design an effective, customized training program.\n\n### 4.4 Perspectives for practice and research\n\n#### 4.4.1 Health promotion\n\nAs a form of HIFT, Hyrox^\u00a9^ shows a significant overlap with the top recent fitness trends such as HIIT, FFT, and bodyweight training (Thompson, 2023). It is therefore to assume that its popularity will further increase. Besides the competitive execution of Hyrox^\u00a9^, it could also be attractive for health-oriented individuals. As outlined above, Hyrox^\u00a9^ training should include endurance training at moderate and high intensities as well as resistance training including all major muscle groups. Hyrox^\u00a9^ training therefore appears as an efficient way to meet the guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO) (Bull et al., 2020). The effectiveness of HIFT in terms of fitness and health (e.g., body composition, musculoskeletal, and cardiorespiratory fitness) has already been shown in previous studies (Claudino et al., 2018; Brandt et al., 2024; Bycura et al., 2017). Additionally, physical activity interventions based on Hyrox^\u00a9^, could benefit from positive motivational aspects that were found in other forms of HIFT such as CF indicating great potential for behavioral change and maintenance (Brandt et al., 2024; Bycura et al., 2017). The lower number and complexity of exercises compared to CF could further reduce barriers for participation in diverse populations with reduced physical capabilities (e.g., overweight and obese individuals, older adults, and those with physical impairments) (Winter and Gutman, 2022). Nevertheless, Hyrox^\u00a9^ still provides considerably more variation than other endurance activities (e.g., running, cycling, swimming) which has been reported to facilitate exercise participation among fitness practitioners (Winter and Gutman, 2022). Due to its similarity to CF, it is to assume that Hyrox^\u00a9^ participants also benefit from intrinsic motives such as enjoyment, challenge, and affiliation that support long-term adherence (Fisher et al., 2017). Furthermore, Hyrox^\u00a9^ offers different divisions with scaled competition standards, allowing participants of varying fitness levels and age groups to compete with each other (Bergmann, 2024). This does not only increase the accessibility of Hyrox^\u00a9^ for different populations, but might additionally results in levels of interest and enjoyment typically seen in sports (Frederick and Ryan, 1993).\n\n#### 4.4.2 Tactical populations\n\nAnother potential application area could be the training of tactical populations including soldiers, firefighters, and law enforcement personnel. These groups have to be prepared for a high variety of physical tasks such as dismounted patrols, casualty carry, or intensive combat situations while carrying heavy equipment. Hyrox^\u00a9^ could address the need for versatile fitness adaptions (e.g., strength, power, aerobic, and anaerobic capacity) in tactical populations and additionally teach movement patterns such as lifting, pulling, pushing, carrying, and throwing external loads that are common in mission tasks (Bergmann, 2024). Previous studies have already demonstrated the potential of HIFT for tactical populations. Haddock et al. concluded that HIFT modalities (e.g., CF, SEALFIT, US Marine Corps\u2019 High Intensity Tactical Training) provide several benefits such as improved conditioning and strength, general physical preparedness for unpredictable physical demands, less injury potential, low equipment costs, high scalability, and 25%\u201380% lower training volume compared to conventional military fitness training (Haddock et al., 2016).\n\n#### 4.4.3 Implications for future research\n\nWhile the present study provided a valuable foundation regarding the characteristics of Hyrox^\u00a9^, further research that builds on these results and addresses the limitations identified in this study is needed to gain a comprehensive understanding of this novel HIFT modality. Firstly, it is important to note that all but one participant in the present study demonstrated very good to excellent cardiorespiratory fitness levels based on their VO~2~max values (exception was one male participant showing good cardiorespiratory fitness) (Heyward, 2006). In terms of strength, again 8 participants showed above-average HGS for their age-group whereby only 3 male participants ranged slightly below-average (93.2%\u201399.6% of reference values) (Ewald and Kohler, 1991). This needs to be considered since physiological differences between athletes differing in experience or fitness level could affect performance and physiological responses (Mangine et al., 2020; Lorenz et al., 2013). Consequently, together with the small sample size, the generalizability of the present findings remains limited. To establish a more nuanced understanding of the characteristics of Hyrox^\u00a9^ across different fitness levels, future studies could include a larger, more heterogenous sample. An alternative approach might be to continue working with small sample sizes but homogeneous groups (e.g., only elite men or women), allowing for more distinct conclusions regarding the specific cohort, as was done by Mart\u00ednez-G\u00f3mez et al. and Sauv\u00e9 et al. for elite CF athletes (Sauv\u00e9 et al., 2024; Mart\u00ednez-G\u00f3mez et al., 2020). Furthermore, investigations should be extended to other Hyrox^\u00a9^ divisions besides the \u201cIndividual Open\u201d (e.g., Individual Pro, Doubles, Relay).\n\nFurther limiting factors of the present study were that each participant performed the Hyrox^\u00a9^ alone (no competitors or spectators), runs did not take place on a track, and the sled used differed from the official competition sled. Especially running on a competition-standard track could lead to different results. For instance, Peserico and Machado found lower running velocity and HR~avg~ but higher HR~max~ when participants ran 60 min on a treadmill compared to a track. Additionally, the authors reported differences in pacing strategies between the track and treadmill condition (Peserico and Machado, 2014). Similar results were confirmed in previous studies investigating shorter distances (Nummela et al., 2007; Morin and S\u00e8ve, 2011). In future studies, efforts should be made to replicate competition conditions more accurately or measure athletes during official competitions. To enhance the understanding of potential performance determinants, it is also recommended to expand the test battery with additional measurements. An effective method could be the determination of a total athleticism score, as recently proposed by Tibana et al. in the context of CF. The authors calculated the score based on body fat percentage, VO~2~max, muscle power, and muscle endurance providing a holistic measure for overall athleticism (Tibana et al., 2024). A similar tool could be developed and applied in Hyrox^\u00a9^, incorporating Hyrox-specific movements and accessible tests (e.g., the critical speed test). Lastly, the potential effectiveness of Hyrox^\u00a9^ in terms of health-promotion and tactical training has not been confirmed yet and must be investigated in future studies. In this context, future research should focus not only on fitness and health adaptions but also on motivational aspects, the potential for behavioral change and maintenance, training time and volume, costs, equipment requirements, injury prevalence as well as the applicability across various settings (e.g., commercial gyms, workplace health promotion, military bases, and during deployments abroad).\n\n## 5 Conclusion\n\nHyrox^\u00a9^ is an endurance-focused form of HIFT that combines running with 8 different functional movements. Performing a Hyrox^\u00a9^ required athletes to engage both aerobic as well as anaerobic metabolic pathways and to transition between varying metabolic demands depending on the executed movement. Participants spent the majority of the Hyrox^\u00a9^ running whereas the intensity according to HR, BL, and RPE values was higher during the exercise stations. Although endurance capacity respectively training appeared to be of greater importance for performance than measures of strength, individual weaknesses should be considered to design effective and sustainable training programs. In this regard, it is suggested to apply CT training recommendations (Methenitis, 2018). Despite the limitations of this first Hyrox^\u00a9^ study and the need for further investigations, Hyrox^\u00a9^ has emerged as a form of HIFT likely to gain further popularity and offering practical applications beyond its competitive nature, including health promotion and tactical population training.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe authors would like to thank the study participants for volunteering.\n\n## Funding Statement\n\nThe author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

HYROX Event Format \u2014 Complete Reference\n\n### 1.1 Core Concept\n\nHYROX is an indoor mass-participation fitness race combining running and functional workout stations. It was co-founded by Christian Toetzke and designed by Mintra Tilly (Director of Sport). The format is standardised worldwide: **8 \u00d7 1 km runs** alternating with **8 functional workout stations**, always performed in the same fixed order. Every racer \u2014 regardless of division \u2014 runs the same total distance of **8 km**. Divisions differ only in the weights, loads, and (historically) rep counts at the stations.\n\n*(Source: Official HYROX 25/26 Singles Rulebook, Section 1 \"Concept\")*\n\n### 1.2 Station Order and Race Sequence\n\nThe race always follows this exact sequence:\n\n| Segment | Activity |\n|---------|----------|\n| Run 1 (1 km) | \u2192 |\n| **Station 1** | SkiErg \u2014 1,000 m |\n| Run 2 (1 km) | \u2192 |\n| **Station 2** | Sled Push \u2014 50 m (4 \u00d7 12.5 m) |\n| Run 3 (1 km) | \u2192 |\n| **Station 3** | Sled Pull \u2014 50 m (4 \u00d7 12.5 m) |\n| Run 4 (1 km) | \u2192 |\n| **Station 4** | Burpee Broad Jump \u2014 80 m |\n| Run 5 (1 km) | \u2192 |\n| **Station 5** | Rowing \u2014 1,000 m |\n| Run 6 (1 km) | \u2192 |\n| **Station 6** | Farmers Carry \u2014 200 m |\n| Run 7 (1 km) | \u2192 |\n| **Station 7** | Sandbag Lunges \u2014 100 m |\n| Run 8 (1 km) | \u2192 |\n| **Station 8** | Wall Balls \u2014 100 reps |\n| **\u2192 Finish Line** | |\n\n*(Source: Official HYROX 25/26 Singles Rulebook, Section 4.1)*\n\n### 1.3 Complete Station Weights, Distances, and Reps by Division\n\nThe following table contains the **exact** specifications from the official 2025/26 HYROX Rulebook.

The course layout follows a consistent template across all global events:\n\n- **Running Track:** An approximately 1 km loop laid out **around the perimeter** (outside edge) of the venue. Depending on venue size, each 1 km run may consist of 1\u20135 laps. A dividing line splits the track into a **Fast Lane** (inside, for racers at \u22644:00/km pace) and a **Running Lane** (outside, for all others).\n- **Roxzone (Transition Zone):** The central area **inside** the running track. Athletes enter and exit the Roxzone through clearly marked **IN and OUT arches** along one side of the running track. The Roxzone typically adds approximately **800 m to 1 km** of additional movement distance across the full race (jogging/walking between the running track and the workout stations).\n- **Workout Stations:** All 8 stations are set up **inside** the Roxzone, in the centre of the venue. They are arranged sequentially so athletes proceed through them in order.\n- **Start Tunnel:** A designated tunnel/chute where athletes assemble before their wave start.\n- **Finish Line:** Positioned after the Wall Ball station (Station 8). Athletes proceed from Wall Balls to a \"Finisher Stage\" and cross the finish line.\n- **Spectator Areas:** Marked zones adjacent to the Roxzone where spectators can watch the workout stations.\n\n*(Sources: Official HYROX Rulebook, fitnessexperiment.co course layout analysis, rox-coach.com Roxzone guide)*\n\n### 1.6 Wave Start System and Timing\n\nHYROX uses a **wave start system** with waves departing at regular intervals, typically **every 10 minutes**. Key timing details:\n\n- Each racer is assigned a specific start time communicated before race day and confirmed at check-in.\n- The start time must be **written visibly on the racer's arm**.\n- Starting in any wave other than the assigned one (without prior approval) results in **disqualification**.\n- Racers within the same wave are always from the **same division** (e.g., all Men's Pro start together).\n- A **timing chip** worn on the ankle records splits for each run, each Roxzone entry/exit, and each station completion. Doubles teams carry 2 chips; Relay teams carry 4.\n- Racers must assemble in the **Start Zone Area** 10 minutes before their wave time.\n- Wristband colour indicates division: White (Women's Open), Grey (Women's Pro / Men's Open), Black (Men's Pro), and/or Green (for specific identifiers).\n\n*(Source: Official HYROX 25/26 Rulebook, Sections 8 and 12)*\n\n### 1.7 Transition Zone (Roxzone) Rules and Penalties\n\n| Rule | Detail | Penalty |\n|------|--------|---------|\n| Enter Roxzone via **IN arch** | Must use correct arch when coming off the running track | **2 min penalty** per infringement for using OUT arch to enter |\n| Exit Roxzone via **OUT arch** | Must use correct arch when returning to running track | **2 min penalty** per infringement for using IN arch to exit |\n| No outside assistance | No food, drink, or help from spectators/coaches in Roxzone | **3 min penalty** per infringement (classified as outside assistance) |\n| Water provided at aid stations only | Fluids available at designated aid stations within Roxzone | Water is for **drinking only** \u2014 not for active cooling (pouring over body). 2 min penalty. |\n| No littering | Paper cups and gel wrappers must be placed in bins | **2 min penalty** per infringement |\n| No spitting / nose clearing on floor | Hygiene rule | **2 min penalty** per infringement |\n| Chalk usage | Only event-provided chalk may be used, and **only at Sled Pull and Farmers Carry** | **2 min penalty** for using chalk at any other station |\n| Shoes | Must be worn at all times except at Wall Balls, where they may be removed and placed under the rig. Must be carried to finisher stage after Wall Balls. | \u2014 |\n\n*(Source: Official HYROX 25/26 Rulebook, Sections 8.1, 11, 13)*\n\n### 1.8 Doubles Format Differences\n\nHYROX Doubles is a **two-person team** format available in the following divisions:\n- **Men's Doubles** (Open or Pro)\n- **Women's Doubles** (Open or Pro)\n- **Mixed Doubles** (Open only at regular events)\n\nKey differences from Singles:\n\n| Aspect | Singles | Doubles |\n|--------|---------|---------|\n| Running | Individual runs all 8 km | **Both partners run together** for all 8 \u00d7 1 km. Must stay together (penalty for separation: 1 min per run/station, DQ after 3rd infringement). |\n| Stations | Individual completes every station | Partners **split each station** however they choose (e.g., one does 60 wall balls, the other does 40). Only one partner works at a time; the other waits. |\n| Sled distances | 4 \u00d7 12.5 m | **8 \u00d7 12.5 m** (doubled distance for most stations) |\n| Burpee Broad Jump | 80 m | **160 m total** (split between partners) |\n| Farmers Carry | 200 m | **400 m total** (split between partners) |\n| Sandbag Lunges | 100 m | **200 m total** (split between partners) |\n| SkiErg | 1,000 m | **2,000 m total** |\n| Rowing | 1,000 m | **2,000 m total** |\n| Wall Balls | 100 reps | **200 reps total** |\n| Weights (Open) | As per Open singles table | Same Open weights |\n| Weights (Pro) | As per Pro singles table | Same Pro weights |\n| Mixed Doubles | N/A | Uses **Men's Open weights** for all stations (which equals Women's Pro weights). Women's target height (2.70 m) for wall balls. |\n\n*(Sources: Official HYROX 25/26 Doubles Rulebook, warriorperformancelab.com, fitnessexperiment.co)*\n\n### 1.9 Relay Format\n\nThe **Team Relay** is a 4-person event. Each team member completes **2 running segments and 2 workout stations**:\n- Person 1: Run 1 \u2192 SkiErg \u2192 Run 2 \u2192 Sled Push\n- Person 2: Run 3 \u2192 Sled Pull \u2192 Run 4 \u2192 Burpee Broad Jump\n- Person 3: Run 5 \u2192 Rowing \u2192 Run 6 \u2192 Farmers Carry\n- Person 4: Run 7 \u2192 Sandbag Lunges \u2192 Run 8 \u2192 Wall Balls\n\nAvailable as Men's Relay, Women's Relay, and Mixed Relay. Uses Open weights.\n\n### 1.10 Recent Rule Changes for the 2025/26 Season\n\n| Change | Detail | Effective |\n|--------|--------|-----------|\n| **Women's Open Wall Balls: 75 \u2192 100 reps** | Women's Open and Women's Open Doubles now do **100 wall balls** (previously 75).

(median finish time 86.5 min, Individual Open Division) found:\n\n| Component | Median Time | % of Total Race |\n|-----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| **Total Running (8 km)** | 51.2 min | **~59%** |\n| **Total Stations (8 stations)** | 32.8 min | **~38%** |\n| **Roxzone / Transitions** | ~3\u20137 min (included in above) | **~3\u20137%** |\n| **Full Race** | 86.5 min | 100% |\n\n**Key finding:** Running time was **significantly longer** than station time (p = 0.003). Running accounts for approximately **50\u201360%** of total race time across all ability levels, with the percentage being slightly higher for slower athletes (who degrade more on later runs).\n\n#### Elite vs. Average Breakdown (Roxlyfe.com Analysis \u2014 Pro Division)\n\n| Component | Elite Men (~59 min) | Average Men (~90 min) | Elite Women (~66 min) | Average Women (~90 min) |\n|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Total Running** | 30:46 (52%) | 42:26 (48%) | 34:27 (52%) | 44:09 (49%) |\n| **Total Stations** | 25:10 (43%) | 39:50 (45%) | 28:48 (43%) | 39:49 (44%) |\n| **Roxzone** | 2:54 (5%) | 6:58 (8%) | 3:47 (6%) | 6:12 (7%) |\n| **Total** | 58:50 | 89:14 | 66:22 | 90:11 |\n\n*(Source: roxlyfe.com \"From Average to Elite\" analysis)*\n\n**Critical insight:** Running takes roughly **50\u201355%** of total time for elites and **48\u201350%** for average athletes (since slower athletes lose proportionally more time at stations). The Roxzone is **5\u20136% for elites** but balloons to **7\u20138%** for average athletes.\n\n#### Station Time Rankings (Which Stations Take Longest)\n\nBased on data from hyroxdatalab.com (200,000+ results) and the roxlyfe.com elite analysis:\n\n**For recreational athletes (finishing ~1:30\u20131:40), from longest to shortest station time:**\n\n| Rank | Station | Typical Time (Men, ~1:40 bracket) | Typical Time (Women, ~1:40 bracket) |\n|------|---------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| 1 | **Wall Balls** | 8:02 | 6:30 |\n| 2 | **Sled Pull** | 6:31 | 6:36 |\n| 3 | **Burpee Broad Jump** | 5:15 | 6:00+ |\n| 4 | **Sandbag Lunges** | 5:22 | 5:25 |\n| 5 | **Rowing** | 4:35 | 5:12 |\n| 6 | **SkiErg** | 4:17 | 4:51 |\n| 7 | **Sled Push** | 3:40 | 3:48 |\n| 8 | **Farmers Carry** | 2:32 | 2:45 |\n\n**For elite athletes (finishing ~55\u201360 min):**\n\n| Rank | Station | Typical Time (Elite Men) | Typical Time (Elite Women) |\n|------|---------|--------------------------|---------------------------|\n| 1 | **Wall Balls** | 4:25 | 3:50 |\n| 2 | **Rowing** | 3:58 | 4:29 |\n| 3 | **SkiErg** | 3:47 | 4:12 |\n| 4 | **Sled Pull** | 3:14 | 3:54 |\n| 5 | **Sandbag Lunges** | 3:03 | 3:35 |\n| 6 | **Sled Push** | 2:45 | 3:00 |\n| 7 | **Burpee Broad Jump** | 2:21 | 3:11 |\n| 8 | **Farmers Carry** | 1:37 | 1:57 |\n\n*(Sources: roxlyfe.com \"From Average to Elite\"; hyroxdatalab.com station analysis)*\n\n### 2.4 The Biggest \"Time Sinks\" \u2014 Recreational vs. Elite\n\nThe **variance analysis** from hyroxdatalab.com (comparing 1:20 \"advanced\" to 1:40 \"recreational\" brackets) reveals which stations create the largest time gaps:\n\n| Station | Time Variance (Men) | Time Variance (Women) | Priority Level |\n|---------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|\n| **Wall Balls** | **2:26** | **2:02** | \ud83d\udd34 **HIGH** |\n| **Roxzone (Total Transitions)** | **2:24** | **1:48** | \ud83d\udd34 **HIGH** |\n| **Burpee Broad Jump** | **1:47** | **2:08** | \ud83d\udd34 **HIGH** |\n| **Sandbag Lunges** | 1:27 | ~1:20 | \ud83d\udfe1 MEDIUM |\n| **Sled Pull** | 1:16 | ~1:10 | \ud83d\udfe1 MEDIUM |\n| **Sled Push** | 1:04 | ~0:50 | \ud83d\udfe1 MEDIUM |\n| **Rowing** | 0:28 | ~0:30 | \ud83d\udfe2 LOW |\n| **Farmers Carry** | 0:27 | ~0:25 | \ud83d\udfe2 LOW |\n| **SkiErg** | 0:23 | ~0:25 | \ud83d\udfe2 LOW |\n\n**Interpretation for coaches:**\n\n- **Wall Balls** are the single biggest differentiator. A recreational male athlete averaging 8:02 vs. an advanced athlete at 5:36 \u2014 that's nearly **2.5 minutes** on one station alone. This is because wall balls demand sustained muscular endurance across 100 reps, and technique degrades rapidly under fatigue. A modest 20% improvement saves ~90 seconds.\n- **Roxzone efficiency** is the \"hidden\" time sink. Elite athletes average **~28 seconds per transition** vs. ~52 seconds for recreational athletes. Over 8 transitions, that's **3:12 wasted** \u2014 with zero fitness required to improve it, just urgency and efficiency.\n- **Burpee Broad Jumps** are the third-largest separator. They demand a unique combination of power, coordination, and cardio endurance that disproportionately punishes less fit athletes.\n- **SkiErg, Rowing, and Farmers Carry** show the **smallest** variance. These are more \"democratic\" stations where technique and equipment constraints limit how much faster anyone can go. Focusing training time here yields diminishing returns.\n\nThe roxlyfe.com elite analysis shows an even more dramatic picture for the Sled Pull: elite men take 3:14 while average men take **6:31** \u2014 a ratio of 1:2, compared to a 1:1.3 ratio on Sled Push. The Sled Pull is disproportionately punishing for less-prepared athletes.\n\n*(Sources: hyroxdatalab.com \"Station Performance Analysis\"; roxlyfe.com \"From Average to Elite\")*\n\n### 2.5 Performance Tiers \u2014 Detailed Breakdown\n\nBased on data from hyroxdatalab.com (700,000+ results), roxlyfe.com, Men's Health UK, and the scientific literature.\n\n#### Tier Overview Table (Men's Open / Women's Open)\n\n| Tier | Men's Time | Women's Time | Percentile | Running Pace (avg/km) | Typical Profile |\n|------|-----------|-------------|------------|----------------------|-----------------|\n| **World Class** | < 55 min | < 58 min | Top 0.1% | 3:30\u20133:50/km | Full-time HYROX athletes, Elite 15 competitors |\n| **Elite** | 55\u201375 min | 58\u201384 min | Top 10% | 4:00\u20134:50/km | Competitive hybrid athletes, age group podiums |\n| **Advanced** | 1:15\u20131:25 | 1:26\u20131:38 | Top 10\u201325% | 4:50\u20135:15/km | Dedicated training 5\u20136\u00d7/week, 2+ years HYROX experience |\n| **Intermediate** | 1:25\u20131:40 | 1:38\u20131:54 | 25\u201350th % | 5:15\u20135:45/km | Consistent training 4\u20135\u00d7/week, knows all stations |\n| **Beginner** | 1:40\u20131:54 | 1:54\u20132:10 | 50\u201375th % | 5:45\u20136:30/km | First or second race, general fitness background |\n| **Finisher** | 1:54+ | 2:10+ | 75th+ % | 6:30+/km | New to fitness racing, completion-focused |\n\n*(Source: hyroxdatalab.com \"What is a Good HYROX Time?\")*\n\n#### Tier 1: Sub-60 Minutes (World Class / Elite Pro)\n\n- **Who:** Full-time HYROX athletes competing in the Elite 15 series.

(2025), the first peer-reviewed HYROX study:\n\n| Metric | Value | Context |\n|--------|-------|---------|\n| HR max during race | 185 bpm (median) | Significantly higher during stations than runs |\n| HR average during race | 170.9 bpm | Consistently hard to very hard intensity |\n| % of race at \"very hard\" intensity (>90% HRmax) | 79.5% | Dominant intensity zone |\n| % of race at \"hard\" intensity (70-90% HRmax) | 19.6% | \u2014 |\n| Blood lactate max | 8.5 mmol/L | Peaked during wall balls (final station) |\n| Blood lactate avg | 6.3 mmol/L | Sustained moderate-high lactate throughout |\n| RPE max (Borg scale) | 18 / 20 | Highest at wall balls |\n| Strongest performance predictor | VO\u2082max (\u03c1 = -0.71) | Aerobic capacity is king |\n| Second predictor | Body fat % (\u03c1 = 0.67) | Lower body fat = faster time |\n| Third predictor | Endurance training volume (\u03c1 = -0.68) | More endurance training = better |\n| Strength correlation | **Not significant** (p > 0.05) | HGS, muscle mass % did not correlate with total time |\n\n**Key coaching implication:** HYROX is fundamentally an **endurance event** with strength components, not a strength event with running. The scientific data shows that once athletes have sufficient strength to handle the competition loads, further aerobic capacity development is the primary path to faster times. However, station-specific work remains critical for the high-variance stations (wall balls, burpee broad jumps, sled pull).\n\n### 2.10 Training Time Allocation Recommendation (Based on Data)\n\nThe hyroxdatalab.com \"70/30 Strategy\" and roxlyfe.com analysis converge on the following evidence-based training allocation:\n\n| Training Focus | Allocation | Rationale |\n|---------------|------------|-----------|\n| **Aerobic Base / Running** | 40\u201350% of total training | Running is 50\u201355% of race time. VO\u2082max is the #1 predictor. |\n| **High-Variance Station Work** (Wall Balls, Burpee Broad Jumps, Sled Pull) | 25\u201330% of total training | These 3 stations + Roxzone account for **6\u20138 minutes** of potential time savings. |\n| **Medium-Variance Station Work** (Sled Push, Sandbag Lunges) | 10\u201315% of total training | Moderate improvement opportunity (3\u20134 min savings). |\n| **Low-Variance Station Work** (SkiErg, Rowing, Farmers Carry) | 5\u201310% of total training | Important for technique but limited time-saving leverage (1\u20132 min). |\n| **Compromised Running Practice** | Embedded in above | Running immediately after station work is a critical HYROX-specific skill. |\n| **Roxzone / Transition Practice** | Mental + habitual | \"Free\" time savings \u2014 requires urgency and efficiency, not fitness. Target <6.5% of total race time. |\n\n*(Sources: hyroxdatalab.com \"Station Performance Analysis\" 70/30 strategy; roxlyfe.com coaching recommendations; Brandt et al. 2025 training implications)*\n\n---\n\n*This document was compiled from the Official HYROX 25/26 Season Rulebook (Singles and Doubles), roxlyfe.com world records and analysis articles, hyroxdatalab.com (200,000+ and 700,000+ result datasets), hybridfitnessmedia.com, pace-club.com weight references, Concept2.com equipment specifications, fitnessexperiment.co course layout analysis, warriorperformancelab.com doubles guide, Men's Health UK station time reporting, and Brandt et al.
