          "snippet": "### The Pull Phase\n\n**Initiate with your lats**, not your arms\u2014imagine pulling your elbows down to your hips\n\n- Simultaneously hinge at the hips, driving your weight slightly back\n\n- Pull the handles down past your thighs in a smooth arc\n\n- Keep your core braced throughout\n\n### The Recovery Phase\n\n- Allow arms to rise naturally with the handles\n\n- Return to standing position with controlled momentum\n\n- Don't rush\u2014let the flywheel do some work\n\n- Reset at the top before the next stroke\n\n\u2026\n\n### Mistake #2: Starting Too Fast\n\n**The Problem:** Sprinting the first 200m at race pace and dying by 500m.\n\n**The Fix:** The SkiErg is **Station 1 of 8**. You have seven more workouts plus eight 1km runs ahead. Start at 75% effort and build. Your target should be **negative splitting**\u2014faster second half than first.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Mistake #4: Choppy, Short Strokes\n\n**The Problem:** Taking rapid, abbreviated pulls that generate minimal power.\n\n**The Fix:** **Long, powerful strokes** beat short, frantic ones. Aim for approximately 30-35 strokes per minute at race pace. Quality over quantity.\n\n### Mistake #5: Holding Your Breath\n\n**The Problem:** Forgetting to breathe during the effort, causing early fatigue.\n\n**The Fix:** Conscious, rhythmic breathing. One breath cycle per stroke. Set a breathing pattern early and stick to it.\n\n## SkiErg Pacing Strategy for HYROX\n\nPacing on the SkiErg is crucial. Here's a smart approach:\n\n### Conservative Start (0-300m)\n\n**Effort:**70-75% **Goal:**Let your heart rate settle from the run **Splits:**1:55-2:05/500m\n\n### Build Phase (300-700m)\n\n**Effort:**80-85% **Goal:**Find your sustainable race rhythm **Splits:**1:50-2:00/500m\n\n### Finish Strong (700-1000m)\n\n**Effort:**90%+ **Goal:**Empty the tank knowing the sled push is next **Splits:**1:45-1:55/500m\n\n**Pro Tip:** Don't look at the monitor constantly. Check every 250m to assess your pace and adjust accordingly.\n\n\u2026\n\n## SkiErg Training Workouts for HYROX\n\n### Workout 1: Pacing Practice\n\n- 4 x 500m SkiErg\n\n- Rest 2 minutes between sets\n\n- Goal: Hit the same split (within 3 seconds) on all four rounds\n\n### Workout 2: Race Simulation\n\n- 1km Run\n\n- 1000m SkiErg\n\n- 1km Run\n\n- Track your transition times\n\n### Workout 3: Endurance Builder\n\n- 2000m SkiErg at conversational pace\n\n- Every 500m: 10 push-ups\n\n- Focus on maintaining technique when fatigued\n\n### Workout 4: Interval Power\n\n- 8 x 250m SkiErg\n\n- Rest 1:1 (work:rest ratio)\n\n- Build speed each round\n\n\u2026\n\n## SkiErg Benchmarks: Where Do You Stand?\n\n|Level|1000m Time|Pace/500m|\n|--|--|--|\n|Elite (Pro Division)|Under 3:00|Under 1:30|\n|Advanced|3:00-3:30|1:30-1:45|\n|Intermediate|3:30-4:15|1:45-2:07|\n|Beginner|4:15-5:00|2:07-2:30|\n|First-Timer|5:00+|2:30+|\n**Note:** These times are for the SkiErg in isolation. In a HYROX race, expect your times to be 10-20% slower due to accumulated fatigue.",

          "snippet": "## Optimal Sled Pull Technique\n\nYour pulling technique will depend on the weight of the sled and your strength. Below are the techniques that can be used in both the open and pro divisions to ensure maximum efficiency.\n\n### 1. Take the Slack Out of the Rope\n\nBefore beginning your pull, make sure to eliminate any slack in the rope. The ropes used in Hyrox races are slightly stretchy, so starting with slack will lead to wasted effort. Position yourself, grab the rope, and pull until all slack is gone before you begin exerting force to move the sled.\n\n\u2026\n\n### 3. Hand-Over-Hand Method\n\nThe\n\n**hand-over-hand method** is primarily used by athletes with strong upper bodies. In this technique, you pull the rope by moving your hands one over the other, relying heavily on your biceps. **Short, Choppy Pulls**: Avoid large, sweeping arm movements. Instead, use short, quick pulls to keep the sled moving steadily. **Frequent Reps**: Since each pull moves the sled only a small distance, expect to perform many reps. This technique is effective but can fatigue the arms quickly, so practice is essential if you want to use it during the race.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Final Tips for Sled Pull Success\n\n**Practice Multiple Techniques**: It\u2019s a good idea to practice all three techniques (hand-over-hand, hip extension, and walk-back) to find the one that works best for you, especially as the weight increases. **Work on Grip Strength**: The sled pull is one of the few Hyrox movements that relies heavily on your grip.\nMake sure your grip strength is up to the task, particularly if you\u2019re planning to use the hand-over-hand method. **Use Your Body Weight**: In the walk-back method, don\u2019t underestimate the power of leveraging your body weight. Leaning back effectively will save you energy while moving the sled faster.\n\nBy refining your technique and avoiding common faults, you\u2019ll be able to move the sled efficiently, saving valuable energy for the rest of the race.",

Repeat this, alternating arms until you have completed your desired distance.\n\nBecause you want to maximize inertia and therefore never allow the sled to come to a stop make the pulls fast even if it means slightly shortening each pull.\n**Step 2**\n\nSet up will be similar but this time your arms will be holding the rope almost completely extended and NOT bent. Once you are in position, you will press through the floor with your legs while explosively extending your hips.\n\n**Step 3**\n\nThe inertia created by the explosiveness of Step 2 will give you enough momentum to finish the pull through the arms so that you can maximize every centimeter of each pull.",

          "snippet": "### Fix #1: Stop Pushing from Too High\n\n**\u274c MISTAKE:** Upright torso, arms extended high, pushing down into the sled instead of forward.\n\n**\u2705 FIX:** Hips below shoulders, 45-degree body angle, weight driving forward not down.\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf WHY IT WORKS:** Lower position creates horizontal force vector. When you stand too tall, gravity works against you\u2014you're pushing down into the carpet, creating more friction. A 45-degree lean channels your power horizontally, moving the sled forward with less resistance.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Fix #2: Bent Arms, Not Straight Arms\n\n**\u274c MISTAKE:** Locked-out arms, pushing from shoulders, treating the sled like a bench press.\n\n**\u2705 FIX:** Elbows bent 90-120 degrees. Arms act as connectors, not pushers. Your legs do the work.\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf WHY IT WORKS:** Your legs generate 4x more power than your shoulders. Straight arms force your delts and triceps to engage heavily\u2014they fatigue fast. Bent arms simply transmit leg power to the sled. You're a conduit, not the engine.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Fix #3: Short, Choppy Steps\u2014Not Long Strides\n\n**\u274c MISTAKE:** Taking big running strides, treating it like a sprint.\n\n**\u2705 FIX:** Rapid 6-8 inch steps, maintaining 120+ steps per minute cadence.\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf WHY IT WORKS:** Momentum is everything. Long strides create a stop-start pattern\u2014you decelerate between steps. Short, rapid steps keep constant forward pressure on the sled. Think of it like pedaling a bike in low gear versus high gear up a hill.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Fix #10: Wrong Starting Position\n\n**\u274c MISTAKE:** Starting from standing, then leaning into the sled as you begin pushing.\n\n**\u2705 FIX:** Set position BEFORE first push\u2014already at 45-degree angle, hands placed, core braced.\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf WHY IT WORKS:** The first 3 steps are the hardest\u2014you're breaking static friction. You need maximum power output immediately. Starting from a standing position wastes that crucial first push. Set your position with intention, then explode.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Hand Position Setup\n\n\n\n**Hands shoulder-width apart**(not too narrow)\n\n\n\n**Firm grip**but not death-grip (save forearm energy)\n\n\n\n**Arms bent 90-120 degrees**(elbows in, ready to transmit power)\n\n### Body Position Check\n\n\n\n**Hips below shoulders**(45-degree torso lean\u2014this is critical)\n\n\n\n**Weight on midfoot**ready to drive through heels\n\n\n\n**Core braced hard**(360-degree tension)\n\n\n\n**Glutes engaged**before first step\n\n\n\n**Head neutral**eyes 6 feet ahead on ground\n\n\u2026\n\n### Phase 2: Progressive Load (Weeks 3-4)\n\n**Goal:** Combine multiple fixes as you build to race weight. **Load:**70% race weight \u2192 100% race weight over 2 weeks **Volume:**4-5 sets of 25 meters **Focus:**Combine 2-3 fixes per session (e.g., body angle + arm position + step cadence) **Rest:**2 minutes between sets **Standard:**Maintain form even when tired\n\n**Why:** Technique must scale with load. If form breaks down under race weight, you need more time here.",

A higher damper setting allows more air in, making it harder to spin.\n- Lower settings (1-4): to work on speed and stroke rate, requires higher cadence\n\n- Medium settings (5-7): balanced approach for most athletes during Hyrox rowing\n\n- Higher settings (8-10): increased resistance but can lead to early fatigue\n\nA damper setting of around 5-7 is ideal for balancing power generation with the ability to keep going for 1,000m, so start with this and use your training to find which setting works best for you.",

          "snippet": "## The Sandbag Paradox: High Variability, Low Impact\n\nLet's start with a surprising finding from our analysis of HYROX Utrecht results.\n\nThe sandbag lunges show one of the\n\n**highest time variabilities** of any station. Among athletes finishing between 1:27-1:33 (a tight 6-minute window), sandbag times averaged **5:22 for men** and **4:41 for women**, but ranged dramatically - some athletes completed it in under 3 minutes, while others took over 9 minutes (extreme outliers excluded from analysis).\nWhen comparing across finish-time brackets (1:20, 1:30, 1:40), the sandbag lunges show\n\n**87 seconds of variance for men** and **88 seconds for women** - significantly higher than SkiErg (22 seconds) or Row (28 seconds). This massive variance means it's a **high-leverage training target** with serious time-gain opportunity.\n\nBut here's where it gets interesting.\n\n\u2026\n\n### The Sweet Spot: 0.9-1.1m Steps\n\n**For men (aiming for 1:30 or faster):**\n\n- Target:\n\n**100-110 total steps**\n\n- Step length: 0.9-1.0m\n\n- Expected time: 4:30-5:30\n**For women (aiming for 1:30 or faster):**\n\n- Target:\n\n**110-120 total steps**\n\n- Step length: 0.85-0.95m\n\n- Expected time: 4:00-5:00\n\nFrom our analysis:\n\n**Men's median sandbag time**: 5:18 (1:27-1:33 bracket) **Women's median sandbag time**: 4:39 (1:27-1:33 bracket)\n\nIf you're slower than these targets, step length is your first lever to pull.\n\n\u2026\n\n**The strategic implication:** Your lunge technique directly impacts wall ball capacity. Going quad-dominant on lunges (short steps, upright torso) leaves you with destroyed quads for 100 wall balls. Using longer steps that recruit glutes/hamstrings preserves quad capacity.\n\n**Practical example:**\n\n- Athlete A: 140 short steps (0.7m) on lunges \u2192 quad-dominant loading \u2192 wall balls at 7:30\n\n- Athlete B: 100 longer steps (1.0m) on lunges \u2192 posterior chain emphasis \u2192 wall balls at 6:15\n\n\u2026\n\n### Progression Targets\n\nBy week 6, you should see:\n\n**Time improvement**: 30-60 seconds faster than week 1 **Step count reduction**: -10 to -20 steps (longer steps) **Technique consistency**: Able to maintain form under fatigue **Confidence**: Sandbag station no longer feared\n\n\u2026\n\n- Target: 0.9-1.1m per step (100-110 total reps)\n\n- Longer steps = more glute/hamstring, less quad\n\n- Quad preservation matters for wall balls (r = 0.738 correlation)\n\n**3. Technique Under Fatigue**\n\n- Practice weighted lunges AFTER metabolic work\n\n- Maintain form when quads are screaming\n\n- Foot spacing discipline (30cm width) prevents distance waste\n\n\u2026\n\n### During Farmers Carry (Station 6)\n\n- Shake out quads during walk (dynamic muscle relaxation)\n\n- Spot the lunge course - identify centerline to follow\n\n- Mental prep: \"Next station is my time to gain\"\n\n### RoxZone (Farmers \u2192 Lunges)\n\n- Position sandbag HIGH on traps, NOT low on shoulders\n\n- Secure grip on bag, adjust before starting\n\n- One deep breath, commit to aggression\n\n### During Lunges (100m)\n\n- First 3 steps: Establish line, rhythm, and step length\n\n- Steps 4-90: Lock into autopilot, trust technique\n\n- Final 10 steps: Push pace, smell wall balls\n\n- Constant movement - touch and go on back knee\n\n### Post-Lunges RoxZone\n\n- Don't panic about leg fatigue (it's normal, won't affect run)\n\n- Walk purposefully to wall balls\n\n- Remind yourself: quads preserved by posterior-chain emphasis\n\n- Wall balls first 20 reps will feel hard - push through\n\n\u2026\n\n### What's a good sandbag lunge time for HYROX?\n\nFor athletes targeting 1:30 finish times: men should aim for 4:30-5:30, women 4:00-5:00. The median times from our analysis were 5:18 (men) and 4:39 (women) for the 1:27-1:33 finish bracket.",

          "snippet": "Burpee Broad Jumps (BBJ) is the fourth station in a HYROX event. You need to complete 80meters of BBJs in total during the race.\n\nBy the time you start these, you will have already run 4km and have completed 3 functional stations (SkiErg, sled push, sled pull). Following the BBJs, you have rowing, farmers carries, sandbag lunges and the wall balls station left to complete, with a 1km run in between each station.\n\nBelow is a video (from HYROX) outlining the burpee broad jumps and some training tips\u2026\n\n**HYROX Burpee Broad Jump Standards**\n\nYou must start the BBJ station from the bottom position, chest to floor, with your hands behind the line.\n\nWhen standing back up, the feet cannot pass the previous position of where your hands were placed. You may step back up, or leap back up with both feet at the same time (most, not all, athletes tend to prefer to step up).\n\nFeet must be parallel on take off and landing \u2013 no staggered take offs.\n\nDuring each BBJ your chest must touch the ground in the lower position.\n\nYou may not take any steps forward between reps.\n\nWhen placing your hands on the floor, they must be placed no more than 30cm in front of your feet.\n\nAny violations will lead to a warning. 2 warnings lead to a 15 second time penalty. For more information on the rules and movement standards, please familiarise yourself with rulebook for your event.\n\n**HYROX Burpee Broad Jump Standards**\n\nIn the below video, Rox Lyfe coach Paul Gillingham looks at 2 different techniques for the Burpee Broad Jump movement\u2026\n\n**HYROX Burpee Broad Jump Tips**\n\nBurpee Broad Jumps are an all over body workout, and differs from a traditional burpee as you need to jump forwards with each rep. For most people, they can be very tough and spike your heart rate, especially if you don\u2019t pace them appropriately.\n\nYou want to ideally, if possible, aim for solid consistent pacing throughout the station (as opposed to going really fast for a while, then having to take long breaks while you catch your breath). To help do this, most people benefit from not taking excessively long jumps with each rep; that might seem like the way to get the distance covered as quickly as possible, but it can be very taxing on your legs and heart.\n\nIf you do need to rest while performing the exercise I personally prefer to rest lying on the floor, as opposed to in a standing up position. There will be an element of personal preference with that (so test both options out yourself) but I feel that my heart rate lowers more quickly if I\u2019m lying down than when standing up.\n\nMost people will tend to prefer to step up from the bottom of the burpee, one leg at a time, as opposed to jumping up with both legs together. The latter approach would be quicker if you were able to do it consistently for the full 80 meters, but it does tend to hike your heart rate up a lot more and most of the top athletes will use the step up method.\n\nIf you need any help with training for your next race, check out our personalised coaching options, or our Individual or Doubles 12 week training plan.\n\n",

          "snippet": "The Rowing station is the 5th station in a HYROX event. By the time you get here, you will have run a total of 5km, and completed 4 other functional stations (including ski erg, sled push, sled pull, and burpee broad jumps).\n\nWhilst there are certainly no \u201ceasy\u201d stations in HYROX, the rowing is the one time in the event where you get to sit down. I personally am not a huge lover of rowing, but I do find it quite a nice \u201cbreak\u201d (that really is for want of a better word) during the race. However, if you don\u2019t tackle it appropriately, with appropriate technique and technique, it can really slow you down and sap all of your energy for the remainder of the race. This article will help ensure that doesn\u2019t happen to you!\n\n**HYROX Rowing Requirements**\n\nAll divisions must cover a total distance of 1km on the rowing machine. The machines are made by Concept2.\n\nPrior to starting the workout, the monitor must be (re)set by a judge / volunteer. It\u2019s likely that, as you enter the station, there will be several rowers free, and you\u2019ll be able to get on any one of them (or be guided to one by a judge). Once you\u2019ve started rowing, your feet are not allowed to touch the ground until you\u2019ve finished (unless you are switching over with your partner in a HYROX Doubles).\n\nAfter completing the required distance, the rulebook states that you must raise your arm to call over a judge to confirm the required distance has been completed (hopefully there will already be one nearby). Only after receiving the referee\u2019s confirmation of completion should you leave the machine.\n\n**Damper Settings**\n\nThe damper setting on the ergometer is preset to the following:\n\nWOMEN 5\n\nWOMEN PRO / MEN 6\n\nMEN PRO 7\n\nNote: Each athlete is allowed to adjust the damper setting to their own preferences, as many times as needed. In a Doubles race, only the working doubles team member may adjust the setting.\n\nJohn Steventon does a great job of explaining damper settings (and drag factor) in this video\u2026\n\n**HYROX Rowing Technique**\n\nTechnique is incredibly important on the rower. Not only will the right technique help you go faster, but it will also help you save a lot of energy. Check out this video for a fantastic explainer on what an appropriate technique looks like\u2026\n\nThe only thing I would add to this video is that within HYROX your legs can become very fatigued. After this station, you still have plenty of running to do, as well as sandbag lunges and wall balls. Therefore, some athletes like to use their legs a touch less than might be considered optimal by an expert rower, and a little more upper body, to help avoid too much fatigue for the rest of the race. This comes down to personal preference but it is worth understanding and bearing in mind.\n\n**Stroke Rate**\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is your stroke rate. The Concept2 rower screen will show your stroke rate per minute. The rate you should row at will differ from person to person but, generically speaking, stronger, more powerful athletes will tend to prefer a lower stroke rate (with harder, more powerful strokes), and less strong / more aerobic athletes might prefer a higher number of strokes per minute. This is something to test out in training if possible.\n\n**Breathing**\n\nKeeping control of your breathing, as much as possible, is important throughout the whole of a HYROX event. This can be especially the case on the rower though where it\u2019s easy to lose rhythm with your breathing, and make yourself more fatigued than necessary.\n\nIn general, it\u2019s worth trying to align your breathing with your strokes \u2013 breathing out on the pull, and in on the return. That might not work for everyone, and will depend on your stroke rate to some extent, but it can be a useful cue to be thinking about.\n\n**Rowing Hacks**\n\n**Getting In and Out the Rower**\n\nIt\u2019s possible to waste valuable seconds by not getting on and off the rower as effectively as possible. This is probably the one station which needs a small amount of set up before you can get going. Essentially you want to get your feet tightened under the straps quickly and effectively, adjust the damper setting (if need be), and get rowing as soon as you can. And then once you\u2019ve finished rowing, get your feet out the straps and off the machine as quickly as you can. This is worth a little practice in training (if possible).\n\n**Pacing Yourself**\n\nPacing yourself appropriately is a very important, often underappreciated, element to racing effectively in HYROX. For example, this article shows how important consistent pacing is on the running. It\u2019s not just running though \u2013 appropriately pacing yourself during the row is critical\u2026\n\nYou almost certainly don\u2019t want to row the 1km as fast as you possibly can. That would take so much out of you, and you\u2019ll struggle for the rest of the race. Just going a touch slower on the rower can save you a lot of energy, but not cost too much time. I know, for example, if I cover the 1km maybe 15-20 seconds slower than I\n\n*could* row it, it leaves me enough energy to be effective for the remainder of the race \u2013 and has only \u201ccost\u201d me 15-20 seconds (though, in reality, has actually saved me a lot of time overall).\n\n**What If I Don\u2019t Have Access to a Rowing Machine?**\n\nIf you don\u2019t have access to a rowing machine for your training, it\u2019s obviously not ideal but also far from being the end of the world. Rowing takes up a relatively small portion of a HYROX event. Also, there also isn\u2019t a huge variability in the times that athletes complete this in. You might be drastically worse than someone else on the machine but only end up taking 1 minute longer, for example, than them on the station. Therefore, if you are struggling on the rower, or struggling to get access to train on one, you really shouldn\u2019t worry too much (unless you aspire to win the event!).\n\nThat all said, there are some things you can be doing if you don\u2019t have access to a rowing machine. First and foremost, ensure you\u2019ve watched the above technique video so you have an idea in your mind of what a good technique should look like when race day comes around. In terms of training without a rower, using things such as seated rows, bent over dumbbell rows, deadlifts, and plenty of squat / leg pressing work (rowing is plenty of lower body work, not just upper body) will stand you in good stead. Using resistance bands for your upper body work may also help.\n\n**Podcast Tips**\n\nFor additional tips on the row, check out the below episode of the Rox Lyfe podcast, where I sit and chat with Jane Erbacher from Erg Army. Jane has coached some of the best athletes in the world, including James Newbury and Tia Claire Toomey, and shares a lot of great advice in this chat (you can watch in the YouTube video or listen on the \u201cRox Lyfe Podcast\u201d wherever you get your pods)\u2026\n\nI hope this has helped. Special thanks goes to John Steventon for his help with this article. Check out his brilliant YouTube channel for more videos on helping you to become a better rower.\n\nFinally, I can also recommend this book from Cat Trentham which very clearly explains rowing technique and how to use and understand the machine. Cat has helped to coach, amongst many others, HYROX Elite athlete Rebecca Mason, on her rowing.\n\nMain photo credit to sportograf.com\n\nTo be kept up to date on the new articles on the site, enter your email address in the box below and we\u2019ll keep you posted with our weekly HYROX email that will help you save time / improve your performance in your next race!\n\nAnd if you need any help with a training plan for your next event, check our our HYROX coaching options.\n\n",

          "snippet": "The Wall Ball station is the last station in a HYROX event. By the time you get here, you will have run a total of 8km, and completed 7 other functional stations (including ski erg, sled push, sled pull, burpee broad jumps, rowing, farmers carries and walking lunges). So, you\u2019ll likely be feeling a bit fatigued! I can only assume that the idea to require 100 wall balls at the end of what is already a gruelling event was some kind of crazy joke by whoever thought it up!\n\nIt is an important station where there is a large variability in the times that athletes complete it in. But, unlike with other stations where that applies, you can push yourself to your absolute limit to get them done because it\u2019s the end of the race. This is where leaving something in the tank goes out the window \u2013 by the time you reach the wall balls your tank will likely be almost empty, and you should use the wall balls to fully empty it!\n\nLet\u2019s find out all about this final station in HYROX, and how to finish strongly\u2026\n\n**HYROX Wall Ball Requirements (reps, weights, and target height)**\n\nThe wall ball requirements, by category, in HYROX are as follows:\n\nWomen: 100 Reps * 9lbs (4kg) ball \u2013 to 9-foot target\n\nWomen Pro: 100 Reps * 14lbs (6kg) ball \u2013 to 9-foot target\n\nMen: 100 Reps * 14lbs (6kg) ball \u2013 to 10-foot target\n\nMen Pro: 100 Reps * 20lbs (9kg) ball \u2013 to 10-foot target\n\nMixed Doubles: 100 Reps * 14lbs (6kg) ball \u2013 to 9-foot target\n\nWomen Doubles: 100 Reps * 9lbs (4kg) ball \u2013 to 9-foot target\n\nMen Doubles: 100 Reps * 14lbs (6kg) ball \u2013 to 10-foot target\n\n**HYROX Wall Ball Standards**\n\nFor each rep, you must throw the ball up to strike the centre of the designated target (9 feet high for women, 10 feet for men). Female athletes must hit the bottom of the two targets, male athletes must strike the top target.\n\nBefore the participant starts with the Wall Balls, the ball must be picked up from the ground and the athlete should stand in an upright position with hips and knees extended. He/she may then initiate the movement.\n\nAt the bottom of the squat, the participant\u2019s knees must go below 90\u00b0. To help with this, the athlete can use a box that is placed behind them, and the judge will ensure that the athlete makes contact with the box, for each rep, to determine if the athlete is squatting deep enough.\n\nAt most HYROX events now there will be a screen showing your wall ball count. It will register a rep if you accurately hit the target with the ball, but the judge (who will be watching) can override that, and may give a \u201cno rep\u201d if for whatever reason you have not met the standard (such as lack of inappropriate squat depth).\n\nBelow is a HYROX video covering the wall ball standards. It is very important you understand these and can comply with them. If not, you may get a number of \u201cno reps\u201d on the day which will make everything a whole lot harder and longer.\n\n**HYROX Wall Ball Training Tips**\n\nWhen training for the HYROX wall balls there are a lot of things to consider\u2026\n\nFirst things first, you want to ensure you have a ball of an appropriate weight to train with. My recommendation would be for most of your training to be with a ball that is at least the weight you\u2019ll be using at HYROX. Anything less and it could be too much of a shock to the system, especially at the end of a long race. You can buy balls here (in the UK).\n\nYou\u2019ll also want to make sure you are throwing the ball to an appropriate height. Your gym may already have wall ball targets set up, but if not, you will want to measure the target you are throwing to and ensure it is preferably the same as which you\u2019ll be throwing to at HYROX (9/10 feet, depending on category). This website sells the targets if you wanted to buy one for your home or gym.\n\nA large number of wall balls repetitions will test many muscles of your body. For example, you\u2019ll be using your quads and glutes, with all the squatting, as well as your triceps and delts for the ball throwing element of the exercise. And obviously you\u2019ll also be getting tested aerobically with so many reps required at the end of a long race. It really is the ultimate finisher. It\u2019s worth adding at this point, because of all the muscles tested, that practising wall balls isnt the only way to train for them. Other exercises such as thrusters, over head pressing, and squats, can all carry over very well to the wall ball movements.\n\nWhen training for wall balls in isolation, there are obviously a variety of options in terms of sets, reps, and weight of ball you could use. Periodisation and progression in your training is important. An example session might be to do 5 sets of 20 reps with the heaviest ball you can manage that for (unbroken each set), with a 2-minute rest between each set. This can then progress over time (perhaps in terms of rep, sets, or less rest) over time.\n\nYou\u2019ll also want to be doing some compromised training with your wall balls. As you need to do these at the end of the race \u2013 when you\u2019ll be fatigued \u2013 it is worth practicing your wall balls under fatigue as that\u2019s when your technique is more likely to go out the window.\n\nAs you get closer to the event itself, it can be worth having some sessions where you try to work out how you want to break down the reps for the race itself (if you\u2019re unable to do them completely unbroken \u2013 which applies to most people). Many people make the mistake of doing as many as they can at the start, but end up needing to take a lot of rest between sets after that initial blast (which eats into their finishing time). Instead, more frequent, but very quick rests, may help your overall time. For example, if you can complete 40 reps unbroken from the start, but that leaves you exhausted and unable to complete the remaining 35 / 60 reps (depending on your category), you should have paced yourself a bit better. 15 reps each set with a short rest in between might be a better strategy. This is an exercise you mustn\u2019t let ego get in the way. Everyone is different obviously with what they can manage so your training sessions should be a time when you work out the best approach for you. You may then find, with the adrenaline of the day, that you don\u2019t need a planned rest as you get close to the total rep target, but you are better off to start a bit slower and finish strongly, than vice versa.\n\nFor further HYROX training tips, check out this article.\n\n**HYROX Wall Balls Technique**\n\nYour technique with the wall balls can be very important. At a minimum you\u2019ll need to ensure you are adhering to the standards and, in particular, are squatting deep enough with each rep. As already mentioned, if you struggle with this in the event, they can provide a box for you to make contact with on each rep. However, this is obviously something you want to be working on in training as much as possible if you do struggle with a deep squat.\n\nAside from the depth of squat you should:\n\n\u2013 try to maintain neutral spine position.\n\n\u2013 position yourself approximately the length of one arm away from the rig\n\n\u2013 widen your stance to give you a nice strong base to work from and allow for a deeper squat\n\n\u2013 aim to not move your arms more often, or higher, than they need to for you to hit the target with the ball (the thinking here being that, for many people, the arms and shoulders are the weak points of the movement and likely to fail before the legs, though this will vary by athlete).\n\n\u2013 with each rep, on the concentric part of the movement, rather than just straightening your legs, also go up on to your toes slightly, lifting your heels off the floor. This adds a little extra power and preserves energy elsewhere in the body. Note \u2013 this is a personal preference \u2013 I\u2019ve heard other people say they don\u2019t like this \u2013 so test it out in training.\n\n\u2013 when you have the ball in your hands, you want to keep it as close to the body as possible. Holding it out away from you will put extra pressure on the shoulders, and waste valuable energy.\n\n\u2013 when catching the ball, try to have already just started the squat movement downward. This is much more efficient than catching the ball with straight legs, and then beginning your squat.\n\n\u2013 do your best to control your breathing throughout. I like to breath in at the bottom of the squat (which almost happens fairly naturally), and then breath out at the top of the rep, as you release the ball.\n\n**What Balls are Used?**\n\nThe weights of the balls are shown above. The actual ones used are similar to these.\n\nI really hope that helps.

          "snippet": "Sandbag Lunges is the seventh station in a HYROX event. You need to complete 100m of lunges in total.\n\nYou will have already run 7km and have completed 6 functional stations (SkiErg, sled push, sled pull, burpee broad jumps, rowing and farmers carries). Following the sandbag lunges, you will have a 1km run and the wall balls station left to complete.\n\nThe sandbag lunges primarily target the glutes and thighs. At this late stage in the race, they can feel particularly brutal (as can running 1km straight afterwards!).\n\nThe sandbags used for the lunges in HYROX are produced by Centr.\n\nBelow is a video from HYROX outlining the exercise\u2026\n\n**HYROX Sandbag Lunges Requirements ( weights and distance)**\n\nThe sandbag lunges requirements, by category, in HYROX are as follows:\n\nWomen: 100m with a 10kg sandbag\n\nWomen Pro: 100m with a 20kg sandbag\n\nMen: 100m with a 20kg sandbag\n\nMen Pro: 100m with a 30kg sandbag\n\nMixed Doubles: 100m with a 20kg sandbag\n\nWomen Doubles: 100m with a 10kg sandbag\n\nMen Doubles: 100m with a 20kg sandbag\n\nWomen Relay: 100m with a 10kg sandbag\n\nMen Relay: 100m with a 20kg sandbag\n\nMixed Relay: Female members 100m with a 10kg sandbag / Male members 100m with a 20kg sandbag\n\n**HYROX Sandbag Lunges Standards**\n\nDuring each lunge, the rear knee MUST touch the ground and lunges must be carried out using alternate knees. You cannot take any steps in between repetitions; however, you may stop after each lunge with both feet on the ground if you prefer this to continuous lunges.\n\nAny violations will receive a warning, and a second warning will result in a 5 second penalty.\n\nThe athlete\u2019s foot must completely cross all white lines, including the turning points and finishing line.\n\nThe sandbag MUST always remain on both shoulders. If you put the sandbag down, you will incur a 5 second penalty. If you put the sandbag down a second time, you will be disqualified. This is worth appreciating; while the exercise is obviously extremely tough on the legs, it can also be quite tough on the arms / elbows, as its quite a lot of weight to be carrying for a period of time.\n\n**Doubles** \u2013 The resting partner walks behind the working partner. If the walking partner obstructs other participants, the team will be issued with a 10m distance penalty.\n\nFor more information on the rules around the lunges, you can check the HYROX rulebook for your division.\n\n**Training for the HYROX Sandbag Lunges**\n\nSandbag lunges are one of the most misunderstood stations in HYROX. They aren\u2019t especially technical, but they demand a mix of leg strength, aerobic fitness, joint tolerance, pacing, and the ability to keep moving under fatigue (which can be high this late into the race).\n\nTraining them appropriately is important but also a balancing act. Too little work and it costs you significant time and energy in the race, but too much (or incorrect) work and it can wreck recovery and lead to joint issues. The best approach is steady, progressive exposure with the right supporting work around it.\n\n### Nail the Movement Standard Early\n\nA lot of fatigue in the lunges during HYROX comes from inefficient reps (not to mention potential lost time from time penalties if applied) Key cues include ensuring back knee touches the floor every rep, you don\u2019t drop the bag at all (which can require grip strength), your front foot stays planted / stable, and you stay tall through the torso (don\u2019t fold forward). Efficiency may feel unimportant for a simple lunge, but over 100m it adds up.\n\n### Progress Volume Gradually\n\nHYROX lunges are mostly a muscular endurance problem (as opposed to an issue of pure strength). You need to be able to repeat quality steps for a long time without your legs shutting down. Rather than jumping straight into full race-distance sets, build volume over weeks. Overdoing it can lead to injury risk but also can have an impact on the rest of your training \u2013 too many lunges one day, for example, might impact your ability to run the next).\n\n### Race Specificity\n\nFresh lunges and HYROX lunges are two completely different things. They come late, after sleds, carries, and plenty of running. Therefore, some practice of lunging when in a fatigued state will be important so it\u2019s not a huge shock on race day.\n\nIt\u2019s also likely worth mentioning at this point that you still need to run 1km AFTER completing the lunges. So, practice in training, during certain sessions, moving from running into lunges and back into running.\n\nRegarding fatigue, remember that pacing your race up to the lunges will be an important factor in your lunge performance, as will overall aerobic fitness. If you arrive at the lunge station too cooked, your lunge performance will be impacted regardless of how strong or how much muscular endurance you have. Solid aerobic work (Zone 2, threshold running, compromised intervals) supports better lunges more than many people realise.\n\n### Train the Upper Body Position\n\nPeople often think lunges are \u201clegs only,\u201d but posture can be a factor too. If your trunk collapses under the sandbag, every step costs more. Therefore, useful accessories include front rack holds, Zercher carries, and heavy goblet holds while walking.\n\nYou also need to grip on to the sandbag for the duration of the station. Therefore, exercises such as farmers carries can actually carry over to help you to some extent here.\n\n### Build Joint Tolerance\n\nLunges load the knees, hips, and ankles through a long range of motion. If you don\u2019t have good tolerance here, the movement can feel brutal and difficult to recover from.\n\nIncluding a small amount of knee-friendly prep work each week can make a big difference:\n\n- Deep range split squats or controlled lunges\n\n- Heel-elevated squat patterns\n\n- Step-up variations to strengthen the knee through range\n\nAdditionally, isometric work can be beneficial an underrated tool for lunges. Consider wall sits, holds in the bottom lunge position under load, and short\n\n__hard__ pushes against an immovable object (3 to 5 seconds).\n\n### Potential Weekly Structure\n\nA realistic approach might look like:\n\n- 1 strength session with split squat work + isometrics\n\n- 1 muscular endurance lunge session (progressive volume)\n\n- Occasional compromised lunges inside HYROX-specific workouts\n\nThat can be enough to build confidence and consistency without destroying your legs every week, but obviously every person is different and you\u2019ll need to assess how you feel, perform and recover to come up with an appropriate level for you.

          "snippet": "The Farmer\u2019s Carry is the sixth station in a HYROX event. You need to complete a distance of 200m with the kettlebells in your hands.\n\nWhen you reach the Farmer\u2019s Carry station, you will have already have completed 6km of running and 5 functional stations (SkiErg, sled push, sled pull, burpee broad jumps and rowing).\n\nFollowing this station you have 2km of running and 2 remaining functional stations (Sandbag Lunges and Wall Balls).\n\nThis exercise engages your upper back and core. Good grip strength is required. You may place the kettlebells down without receiving a penalty.\n\nBelow is a video from HYROX outlining the Farmer\u2019s Carry and some training tips\u2026\n\n**HYROX Farmer\u2019s Carry Requirements (Weights and Distance)**\n\nThe Farmer\u2019s Carry requirements, by category, in HYROX are as follows:\n\nWomen: 200m with 2 x 16kg kettlebells\n\nWomen Pro: 200m with 2 x 24kg kettlebells\n\nMen: 200m with 2 x 24kg kettlebells\n\nMen Pro: 200m with 2 x 32kg kettlebells\n\nMixed Doubles: 200m with 2 x 24kg kettlebells\n\nWomen Doubles: 200m with 2 x 16kg kettlebells\n\nMen Doubles: 200m with 2 x 24kg kettlebells\n\nWomen Relay: 200m with 2 x 16kg kettlebells\n\nMen Relay: 200m with 2 x 24kg kettlebells\n\nMixed Relay: Female members 200m with 2 x 16kg kettlebells / Male members 200m with 2 x 24kg kettlebells\n\n**Completing the Farmer\u2019s Carry Station**\n\nThe station is completed when you cross the finish line and return the kettlebells to the marked area. The kettlebells must be placed back in their position with the handles up.\n\nWith many of the stations in HYROX, you should pace them a little so you have the energy to continue for the remainder of the race. My personal belief with the Farmers Carry, however, is that you should complete it as quickly as you possibly can. The longer you hold on to the kettlebells the more taxing it will be on you. You want to get the 200m done as quickly as possible, minimise the amount of time you need to put them down for (if you do at all), and get on with your race.\n\nTarget times:\n\nElite men: ~1:10 to 1:30\n\nElite women: ~1:20 to 1:40\n\nCompetitive age-groupers: ~1:30 to 2:30\n\nIf you are over 3 minutes, this station needs work.\n\n**Training for the Farmer\u2019s Carry**\n\nGrip strength is obviously a factor when it comes to the Farmers Carry in HYROX. Anything that challenges your grip is, in some way, preparing you for this station. Pull-ups, heavy holds, dead hangs and carries all help.\n\nThat said, a fast Farmers Carry time is not just about grip\u2026\n\nIn a conversation with Dr Adam Storey, exercise physiologist and HYROX Sports Science Advisory Council member, on the Rox Lyfe podcast, he said:\n\n*\u201cI would actually classify the farmer\u2019s carry as a postural endurance test. How long can you maintain good posture before things start to crumble?\u201d*\n\nThat changes how you should think about this station.\n\nWhen you watch athletes start to struggle in the Farmers Carry in HYROX, what usually happens first? The shoulders round forward, the upper back collapses, the chest drops, and the torso starts swaying.\n\nOnce posture goes, efficiency goes with it. Your metabolic cost rises, your grip starts to fatigue faster, and your speed drops.\n\nAdam explained that the trap complex plays a huge role here:\n\n\u2013 Upper traps help stabilise the shoulders under load\n\n\u2013 Mid traps maintain scapular retraction\n\n\u2013 Lower traps support thoracic extension\n\nIf you lose scapular control and your shoulders drift forward, your arms move into a weaker mechanical position. The kettlebells feel heavier. Energy leaks increase. Grip fatigue accelerates.\n\nIn other words, your hands might not be the weak link. Your posture might be.\n\nSo instead of only hammering dead hangs and heavy holds, you should also build:\n\n\u2013 Upper back strength\n\n\u2013 Posterior chain endurance\n\n\u2013 Core stability under load\n\n\u2013 The ability to maintain tall, efficient posture while moving\n\nThe fastest Farmers Carry athletes in HYROX do not just have strong hands. They look rock solid from shoulders to hips. No collapse. No wasted motion. That might, therefore, mean including exercises such as Romanian deadlifts, heavy shrugs, barbell rows, single-arm carries, and front rack carries in your training.\n\nThat does not mean specificity is irrelevant.\n\nYou still need to practise moving quickly with kettlebells in your hands. Farmers Carry is a skill under load. The more comfortable you are at race pace, the less it will spike your heart rate and disrupt your rhythm.\n\nOver time, build both:\n\n\u2022 Distance at race weight\n\n\u2022 Heavier carries over shorter distances\n\nFor example:\n\n\u2022 3 rounds of 150m at race weight\n\n\u2022 Or 3 rounds of 60 to 80m at a load above race weight\n\nFarmers Carry is often overlooked because there is always more running to do, more sled work to fit in, more wall balls to survive.\n\nBut it can shape how you enter the final stages of your HYROX race.\n\nAdam Storey described it as a hugely underrated exercise. If you want to improve your Farmers Carry in HYROX, it deserves deliberate training, not leftovers at the end of a session.\n\nShould you need any help with your training for the event, then you may be interested in our personalised coaching options, our 12 week HYROX training plan or our 12 Week Doubles plan.\n\n",

Your 5K PR won't directly predict your HYROX time. The strength stations level the playing field between runners and strength athletes.\n\n### Common Athlete Profiles\n\n**The Runner**\n\n- 5K: 18-20 min\n\n- Strength training: Minimal\n\n- Expected HYROX: 1:30-1:40 (men), 1:50-2:00 (women)\n\n**Bottleneck:**Sled push (152kg/102kg), sled pull, wall balls\n\n**The CrossFitter**\n\n- 5K: 22-24 min\n\n- CrossFit: 3+ years\n\n- Expected HYROX: 1:25-1:35 (men), 1:40-1:50 (women)\n\n**Bottleneck:**Running endurance, pacing the 8km\n\n**The Balanced Athlete**\n\n- 5K: 20-22 min\n\n- Strength training: 2-3x/week\n\n- Expected HYROX: 1:20-1:30 (men), 1:35-1:45 (women)\n\n**Advantage:**No major weaknesses\n\nPure runners often overestimate their HYROX performance by 10-15 minutes, while CrossFitters underestimate theirs by 5-10 minutes. Train both equally for best results.\n\n## What Makes an Elite HYROX Time?\n\nBreaking into elite territory (\n\n**sub-1:15 men**, **sub-1:24 women**) requires four key elements:\n\n### Sub-5:00/km Running Pace\n\nElite athletes average\n\n**4:30-4:50/km** across all 8km of running, even when fatigued from stations.\n\n### Station Efficiency\n\n|Station|Elite Time (Men)|Elite Time (Women)|\n|--|--|--|\n|SkiErg (1000m)|3:50-4:20|4:30-5:00|\n|Sled Push (152kg/102kg)|2:50-3:26|2:50-3:25|\n|Sled Pull (103kg/78kg)|3:50-4:37|4:15-4:59|\n|Burpee Broad Jumps|4:00-4:37|5:15-5:57|\n|Row (1000m)|4:00-4:33|4:45-5:11|\n|Farmers Carry (48kg/32kg)|1:45-1:59|2:00-2:15|\n|Lunges (20kg/10kg)|3:50-4:24|4:00-4:30|\n|Wall Balls (100 reps)|5:30-6:04|5:20-5:53|\nOne bad station can cost you 5-10 minutes. Elite athletes have NO stations slower than 80th percentile\u2014they're well-rounded, not specialists.\n\n### Minimal RoxZone Time\n\nElite athletes average 4-5 minutes total RoxZone time. Intermediate athletes average 7-8.5 minutes, while beginners may take 9-12 minutes or more.\n\n**RoxZone includes:**\n\n- Running from finish line to station\n\n- Running from station to next start line\n\n- Brief mental prep and equipment setup\n\n### Mental Toughness\n\nThe ability to maintain pace when everything hurts. Elite athletes don't slow down\u2014they manage discomfort better.\n\n## How to Improve Your HYROX Time\n\nBased on your current level:\n\n### Beginners (1:40-2:10)\n\n**Focus:** Finish strong, build base fitness\n\n**Training priorities:**\n\n- Run 3-4x per week at conversational pace\n\n- Practice all 8 stations 1x per week\n\n- Focus on technique before speed\n\nDon't worry about speed yet. Learn proper form on all stations\u2014especially sled push/pull technique with the heavy weights (152kg/103kg for men, 102kg/78kg for women).\u2705\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf Ready to train smarter?** Our 12-Week HYROX Training Program takes you from beginner to race-ready with structured workouts, station technique guides, and proven pacing strategies. Just **$29.99** \u2014 less than a single PT session. Start training smart today.\n\n### Intermediate (1:25-1:40 / 1:37-1:54)\n\n**Focus:** Identify weak stations, improve pacing\n\n**Training priorities:**\n\n- Track your split times\u2014find your slowest 2 stations using our race analyzer tool\n\n- Add 1-2 specific station workouts per week\n\n- Practice negative splitting (running faster as race progresses)\n\n- Use our pacing calculator to set realistic split targets\n\n**Example weakness work:**\n\n- Slow at sled push? Add 2x/week heavy sled work\n\n- Slow at wall balls? Practice 100-rep sets 2x/week\n\n### Advanced (1:15-1:25 / 1:24-1:37)\n\n**Focus:** Fine-tune pacing, maximize efficiency\n\n**Training priorities:**\n\n- Interval training 2x per week (tempo runs, VO2 max)\n\n- Station-specific drills 2-3x per week at race weight\n\n- Practice race-pace RoxZone transitions (sprint between stations)\n\n- Mental toughness training (running under fatigue)\n\n- Analyze your performance data with our race analyzer tool\n\n**Want to break through to the next level?** Our structured 12-week program includes progressive periodization, race simulation protocols, and advanced pacing strategies designed to take intermediate athletes to sub-1:20 performance.\n\n### Elite (under 1:15 / 1:24)\n\n**Focus:** Marginal gains, competition strategy\n\n**Training priorities:**\n\n- Periodized training blocks (build, peak, taper)\n\n- Race simulation workouts every 2-3 weeks\n\n- Video analysis of technique on all stations\n\n- Strategic pacing per course (elevation, heat, competition)\n\n## Realistic Time Improvement Expectations\ud83d\udca1\n\nMost athletes improve 15-25% from their first to second race simply by understanding pacing, knowing the stations, and better race-day nutrition.\n\n**First year:** 15-25% improvement\n\n**Year 2-3:** 5-10% annual improvement with consistent training\n\n**Plateau:** Most athletes plateau after 3-5 years unless they significantly change training\n\n### Example Progression (Male, 30-34):\n\n**First race:**1:55:00 (beginner) **6 months later:**1:40:00 (intermediate) \u2192 13% improvement **1 year later:**1:25:00 (advanced) \u2192 15% improvement **2 years later:**1:15:00 (elite) \u2192 12% improvement **3+ years:**1:10-1:14 (peak elite performance)\n\n## Station Benchmarks: Where Are You Losing Time?\n\nHere's what \"good\" looks like for each station (Men / Women, Intermediate level):\n\n|Station|Intermediate (M/W)|Advanced (M/W)|\n|--|--|--|\n|SkiErg|4:27 / 5:11|4:20 / 5:00|\n|Sled Push|3:41 / 3:42|3:26 / 3:25|\n|Sled Pull|5:06 / 5:34|4:37 / 4:59|\n|Burpee Broad Jumps|5:19 / 6:50|4:37 / 5:57|\n|Row|4:44 / 5:24|4:33 / 5:11|\n|Farmers Carry|2:10 / 2:25|1:59 / 2:15|\n|Lunges|4:56 / 5:01|4:24 / 4:30|\n|Wall Balls|7:01 / 6:51|6:04 / 5:53|\nIf any of your stations are slower than the \"Intermediate\" column, that's your biggest opportunity for improvement. Focus 50% of your training on your weakest 2 stations.\n\n## Your Next Steps\n\nNow that you know where you stand:\n\n**Log your last race splits**\u2014 Find your weak stations **Set a realistic goal**\u2014 Aim for 1 category improvement (Beginner \u2192 Intermediate) **Train specifically**\u2014 Dedicate 2x per week to your weakest station **Track progress**\u2014 Retest stations every 4-6 weeks\n\n#### Key Takeaway\n\nA \"good\" HYROX time is relative to your age, gender, and training background. Focus on improving YOUR time, not comparing yourself to elites. Every PR is worth celebrating.\n\n## FAQs\n\n**Q: What's the average HYROX finish time?**\n\nA: Men average around 1:40:00, women average around 1:54:00 across all age groups and divisions. The median (50th percentile) is slightly faster at 1:33-1:38 for men and 1:47-1:52 for women.\n\n**Q: Is sub 1:30 good for a first race?**\n\nA: Absolutely! Sub 1:30 for men puts you in the advanced category (top 30%). For women, sub 1:45 is also advanced level.\n\n**Q: How long does it take to go from beginner to elite?**\n\nA: Most athletes need 3-5 years of consistent, structured training. Expect 10-20% annual improvement in your first 2 years.\n\n**Q: Do pros use different weights?**\n\nA: No. Pro and Open athletes use the same weights (152kg sled push for men, 102kg for women). Only age group 60+ uses modified weights.\n\n**Q: Why are the sleds so heavy?**\n\nA: HYROX uses 152kg (men) and 102kg (women) for sled push to test strength-endurance. The heavy sleds separate pure runners from hybrid athletes.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions About HYROX Times\n\n### What is a good HYROX time for beginners?\n\nFor beginners, a good HYROX time is 1:40-1:54 for men and 1:54-2:10 for women. If you finish your first race in this range, you're performing better than about 50% of HYROX athletes. Focus on completing the race and building a baseline\u2014you can improve your times with targeted training.\n\n### What is the average HYROX time?\n\nThe average HYROX time for men is approximately 1:35, while women average around 1:50. However, this varies significantly by age group, with younger athletes (25-35) typically finishing 5-10 minutes faster than those in the 45-55 age bracket.\n\n### What HYROX time is considered elite?\n\nElite HYROX times are under 1:15 for men and under 1:26 for women. These times put you in the top 10% of all HYROX finishers globally and typically require years of focused training in both running and functional fitness.\n\n### How do HYROX times vary by age?\n\nHYROX times typically slow by 2-3 minutes per decade after age 35. A 1:30 time for a 25-year-old male would be equivalent to approximately 1:37 for a 45-year-old athlete with similar training. Our age group analysis shows detailed breakdowns by age bracket.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYour best time is one you're proud of. Whether you're chasing a PR, trying to beat a friend, or just finishing your first race\u2014every HYROX time represents hours of hard work.\n\nUse these benchmarks to set realistic goals and train smarter, not to judge your worth as an athlete.\n\n**Related Articles:**\n\n- Age Group Performance Analysis \u2014 Detailed age breakdown\n\n- Average Split Times by Age Group \u2014 Realistic benchmarks\n\n- First HYROX Race Guide \u2014 Complete beginner guide\n\n- How to Beat 1:30 \u2014 Complete training requirements\n\n",

          "snippet": "# HYROX Rowing Strategy: How to Pace 1000m and Recover for the Second Half\n\nAfter four stations and five kilometers of running, you finally get to\n\n**sit down**. The Concept2 rower at Station 5 is both a blessing and a trap.\n\nHere's the trap: athletes see sitting and think \"recovery.\" They take it easy, row at 2:30/500m pace, and waste 5+ minutes getting nowhere. Or they do the opposite\u2014sprint at 1:40/500m pace because they finally feel okay, only to implode during the farmer's carry.\n\n**1000 meters of rowing** demands strategy. Done right, it's active recovery that doesn't cost you time. Done wrong, it's a momentum killer or an energy burner that haunts you for the final three stations.\n\nIn this guide, you'll learn how to row efficiently, pace strategically, and use Station 5 as a tactical advantage instead of a liability.\n\n## What is the Rowing Station in HYROX?\n\nThe rowing station is\n\n**Station 5** in HYROX\u2014the first station of the race's second half. After your fifth 1km run (following burpee broad jumps), you complete **1000 meters** on the Concept2 rowing machine.\n\n**Race Standards:** **Distance:**1000 meters **Machine:**Concept2 RowErg (Damper setting at athlete discretion) **Position in Race:**Station 5 (after fifth 1km run) **Average Completion Time:**3:30-5:00 (depending on fitness and pacing strategy)\n\n**Strategic Position:** The row comes at the race's midpoint when fatigue is highest. It's also the last \"seated\" station\u2014everything after requires standing and loaded movement.\n\n## Rowing Muscles Worked: The Full-Body Engine\n\nThe rowing stroke is\n\n**85% legs, 10% core, and 5% arms**. Most people get this ratio completely wrong.\n\n### Primary Muscles\n\n**Quadriceps:**Drive the initial push phase\u2014the most powerful part of the stroke. **Glutes:**Extend the hips during the drive. **Latissimus Dorsi:**Pull the handle during the finish phase. **Hamstrings:**Assist in the drive and control the recovery.\n\n### Secondary Muscles\n\n**Core (Rectus Abdominis, Obliques):**Transfers power from legs to arms and maintains posture. **Biceps:**Assist in the pulling motion. **Forearms:**Control handle grip throughout the stroke. **Calves:**Push off the foot stretchers. **Erector Spinae:**Maintains spine stability during the layback.\n\n### The Leg Drive Advantage\n\n**Key Insight:**Elite rowers generate 70% of their power from legs, not arms. In HYROX, your arms are already fatigued from SkiErg, sled pull, and burpees. **Leg drive is your advantage.**Use it.\n\n## Perfect Rowing Technique: The HYROX-Optimized Stroke\n\nRowing efficiency matters more than raw power. Here's the stroke breakdown:\n\n### The Catch (Start Position)\n\n- Shins vertical, knees bent\n\n- Arms extended, shoulders forward\n\n- Core engaged, back straight\n\n- Grip relaxed\u2014hooks, not death grip\n\n### The Drive (Power Phase)\n\n**Push with your legs first**\u2014the handle doesn't move until your legs extend\n\n- Once legs are almost straight,\n\n**lean back slightly**(to 1 o'clock position) **Pull handle to lower chest**as the final motion\n\n- Sequence: Legs \u2192 Back \u2192 Arms (always in that order)\n\n### The Finish\n\n- Legs straight\n\n- Slight layback\n\n- Handle at lower chest/upper stomach\n\n- Brief pause\u2014don't rush the recovery\n\n### The Recovery (Return to Catch)\n\n**Arms extend first** **Body rocks forward** **Legs bend last**as you slide back to the catch\n\n- Recovery should take twice as long as the drive\n\n- Sequence: Arms \u2192 Back \u2192 Legs (reverse of drive)\n\n### Stroke Rate for HYROX\n\n**Target:**24-28 strokes per minute for most athletes **Too slow (under 22):**You're leaving time on the table **Too fast (over 32):**You're probably getting sloppy and wasting energy\n\n## Common Rowing Mistakes (And How to Fix Them)\n\n### Mistake #1: Arms Before Legs\n\n**The Problem:** Pulling with your arms before your legs extend, losing power.\n\n**The Fix:** Drill it: \"Legs. Back. Arms.\" Say it out loud during training. The handle shouldn't bend until your legs are almost straight.\n\n### Mistake #2: Hunching Forward\n\n**The Problem:** Rounding your back at the catch, straining your lower back.\n\n**The Fix:** Keep your **chest proud** throughout the stroke. Engage your lats at the catch to maintain posture.\n\n### Mistake #3: Rushing the Recovery\n\n**The Problem:** Sliding back to the catch at the same speed as the drive, creating jerky strokes.\n\n**The Fix:** The recovery is **controlled rest**. Slow slide forward, explosive drive back. 2:1 ratio.\n\n### Mistake #4: Damper Setting Too High\n\n**The Problem:** Setting the damper to 10 thinking it makes you faster. It doesn't.\n\n**The Fix:** Set damper between **4-6** for most athletes. It's not a resistance machine\u2014it controls airflow. Higher settings fatigue your muscles faster without improving speed.\n\n### Mistake #5: Pulling to Your Chin\n\n**The Problem:** Finishing with the handle at neck level, straining arms and shoulders.\n\n**The Fix:** Handle finishes at **lower chest or upper stomach**. Elbows should pull straight back, not up.\n\n### Mistake #6: Death Grip on the Handle\n\n**The Problem:** Squeezing the handle like it owes you money, frying already-fatigued forearms.\n\n**The Fix:** Loose hook grip. Fingers over the handle, relaxed grip. Your back does the pulling, not your hands.\n\n## HYROX Rowing Pacing Strategy\n\nThe 1000m row is a strategic puzzle. Here's how to solve it:\n\n### Option 1: Conservative \"Recovery\" Pace\n\n**Best For:** Athletes who struggled in the first half and need to regroup.\n\n**Splits:**\n\n- 0-250m: 2:05-2:10/500m\n\n- 250-500m: 2:05-2:10/500m\n\n- 500-750m: 2:00-2:05/500m\n\n- 750-1000m: 1:55-2:00/500m\n\n**Total Time:** ~4:00-4:15\n\n**Benefit:** Lowers heart rate, catches breath, preserves legs for farmer's carry.\n\n### Option 2: Steady State \"Time Saver\" Pace\n\n**Best For:** Athletes who are racing for time and feeling okay.\n\n**Splits:**\n\n- 0-250m: 1:55-2:00/500m\n\n- 250-500m: 1:50-1:55/500m\n\n- 500-750m: 1:50-1:55/500m\n\n- 750-1000m: 1:45-1:50/500m\n\n**Total Time:** ~3:40-3:50\n\n**Benefit:** Solid time without burning out.\n\n### Option 3: Aggressive \"Send It\" Pace\n\n**Best For:** Elite athletes who can recover on the run.\n\n**Splits:**\n\n- 0-250m: 1:45-1:50/500m\n\n- 250-500m: 1:42-1:47/500m\n\n- 500-750m: 1:42-1:47/500m\n\n- 750-1000m: 1:40-1:45/500m\n\n**Total Time:** ~3:20-3:30\n\n**Benefit:** Maximum time savings, but requires fitness to recover.\n\n### The Golden Rule\n\n**Negative split your row.** Start conservative, finish fast. A 2:00 first 500m and 1:45 second 500m is better than blowing up at 1:40 and crawling to a 2:10 finish.\n\n## Rowing Alternatives for Training\n\nNot everyone has a Concept2 rower at home. Here are alternatives that build rowing fitness:\n\n### 1. Dumbbell Rows (High Rep)\n\n**Why It Works:**Builds back endurance and mimics the pulling pattern **Protocol:**4 sets of 20-25 reps each arm\n\n### 2. Resistance Band Rows\n\n**Why It Works:**Low-impact back and core work **Protocol:**100 reps for time with medium band\n\n### 3. Bent-Over Barbell Rows\n\n**Why It Works:**Develops back strength and core stability **Protocol:**3 sets of 15 at moderate weight\n\n### 4. Good Mornings\n\n**Why It Works:**Strengthens the posterior chain used in the rowing drive **Protocol:**3 sets of 12\n\n### 5. Kettlebell Swings\n\n**Why It Works:**Hip drive power that transfers to leg drive in rowing **Protocol:**5 rounds of 20 swings\n\n### 6. Bike Erg or Assault Bike\n\n**Why It Works:**Similar aerobic demand with seated position **Protocol:**3km bike for time\n\n### 7. Deadlifts + Pull-Ups (Superset)\n\n**Why It Works:**Combines the hip hinge and pulling patterns **Protocol:**5 rounds: 8 Deadlifts + 10 Pull-Ups\n\n## Rowing Training Workouts for HYROX\n\n### Workout 1: Pacing Practice\n\n- 4 x 500m Row\n\n- Rest 2 minutes between\n\n- Goal: Negative split each 500m AND the overall set\n\n### Workout 2: Race Simulation (Stations 4-6)\n\n- 1km Run\n\n- 80m Burpee Broad Jumps\n\n- 1km Run\n\n**1000m Row**\n\n- 1km Run\n\n- 200m Farmer's Carry\n\n- Track all splits\n\n### Workout 3: Endurance Builder\n\n- 3000m Row\n\n- Every 500m: Get off and do 10 push-ups\n\n- Goal: Maintain consistent split despite interruptions\n\n### Workout 4: Interval Power\n\n- 8 x 250m Row\n\n- Rest 1:00 between\n\n- Goal: Hold target split across all 8 pieces\n\n### Workout 5: Leg Drive Focus\n\n- 5 x 500m Row\n\n- Stroke rate cap: 22 SPM\n\n- Goal: Hit fast splits with slow strokes (forces leg drive efficiency)\n\n## The Strategic Advantage: Row to Recover\n\nHere's the HYROX secret: the row is the\n\n**only station where you sit down**. Smart athletes use this strategically.\n\n**What Recovery Looks Like:**\n\n- Controlled breathing returns\n\n- Heart rate drops 10-15 BPM\n\n- Legs get brief relief from impact\n\n- Mental reset before the final push\n\n**What Recovery Does NOT Look Like:**\n\n- Going so easy you waste 5+ minutes\n\n- Stopping mid-row to catch your breath\n\n- Ignoring technique and letting form fall apart\n\nThe row should feel like you're\n\n**working but sustainable**. If you can't talk in short sentences, you're going too hard. If you could read a book, you're going too easy.\n\n## Train Like You Race\n\nHere's the problem: most people train rowing fresh. They hop on the Concept2 with rested legs and pull a great 1000m time. Then race day comes, and they're rowing after burpee broad jumps with legs full of lead.\n\n**OnlyGains.ai fixes this disconnect.** The platform creates unlimited free HYROX simulations that put rowing where it belongs\u2014after stations 1-4, with accumulated fatigue. You train the row in context, not in isolation.\n\nWhen you know what 1000m feels like after 5km of running and 4 brutal stations, you can pace race day confidently. No surprises, no blow-ups, just smart execution.\n\n## Rowing Benchmarks: Where Do You Stand?\n\n|Level|1000m Time|Pace/500m|\n|--|--|--|\n|Elite|Under 3:10|Under 1:35|\n|Advanced|3:10-3:40|1:35-1:50|\n|Intermediate|3:40-4:15|1:50-2:07|\n|Beginner|4:15-5:00|2:07-2:30|\n|First-Timer|5:00+|2:30+|\n**Note:** These times are for fresh rowing. Expect 10-20% slower in a HYROX race due to fatigue.\n\n## Mental Game: The Halfway Turning Point\n\nStation 5 is psychologically critical. You're done with the hardest station (burpees), but you've still got three loaded carries and three runs ahead.\n\n**Winning the mental game:** **Celebrate the midpoint:**You're halfway done. Acknowledge the accomplishment. **Enjoy the seat:**Seriously\u2014this is the only time you get to sit. Appreciate it. **Visualize success:**During the row, picture yourself finishing strong at wall balls. **Trust your pacing:**Don't panic if you're not the fastest rower. Stick to your plan.\n\n## Final Thoughts: Row Smart, Finish Strong\n\nThe rowing station separates athletes who race strategically from those who wing it. It's not about being the fastest rower\u2014it's about using the row to set up a strong finish.\n\n**Key Takeaways:** **Legs drive the stroke**\u2014not arms **Pace conservatively**\u2014negative split your row **Use it for recovery**\u2014lower heart rate and breathe **Don't waste it**\u20145-minute rows cost you podium spots **Train in context**\u2014row fatigued, not fresh\n\nThe athletes who crush HYROX treat the row as tactical recovery. They come off the rower ready for farmer's carries, not gasping for survival.\n\n**Ready to build your race strategy?** OnlyGains.ai generates personalized HYROX training programs that teach you how to row under fatigue. Unlimited free simulations mean you can practice race pacing without guessing.\n\n",

          "snippet": "###### Movement\u2022\n\n###### Centr Team\n\n# HYROX station guides: Wall balls\n\nThis is it \u2013 the final station. You\u2019ve pushed sleds, pulled weight, rowed hard, and carried heavy. Now all that stands between you and the finish line is 100 Wall Balls. Simple, right? Not quite.\n\nThe wall ball station is the ultimate test of full-body fatigue, movement efficiency, and mental toughness. Nail your pacing and technique here, and you\u2019ll cap off your race with strength and confidence.\n\nWant to nail your form on every HYROX station? Get dialed in with our full series:\n\nLooking for a complete training solution? Centr is the only place to find HYROX-certified programs to help you prep, recover, and stay race-ready.\n\n*Get race-ready with our HYROX-certified training programs \u2013 only available on the Centr App.*\n\n## Why Wall Balls make you a better athlete\n\nWall Balls are a deceptively challenging movement that tax your muscular endurance, coordination, and aerobic capacity \u2013 all while demanding near-perfect squat mechanics. They\u2019re a compound, cyclical movement that leaves no room for sloppy reps, especially under race-day pressure. But they deliver big athletic benefits:\n\nStrengthens legs, glutes, and shoulders\n\nTrains hip-to-shoulder power transfer\n\nDemands proper squat depth and posture under load\n\nEnhances movement rhythm and breathing control\n\n## HYROX Wall Balls reps\n\nWall balls are measured in reps \u2013 not distance \u2013 and there\u2019s only one number you need to focus on: 100.\n\n100 reps for all divisions\n\nWomen Open: 4kg ball (white marking)\n\nWomen Pro, Men Open: 6kg ball (grey marking)\n\nMen Pro: 9kg ball (black marking)\n\nYou\u2019ll also be throwing your ball to a different height depending on your division. This is good to know so your training can replicate race-day conditions.\n\nAll Women\u2019s divisions: 2.7 meters\n\nAll Men\u2019s divisions: 3 meters\n\n## Official HYROX Wall Ball rules\n\nThis close to the finish line, it\u2019s tempting to speed through. But every no-rep costs time and energy. You\u2019ll be running on fumes, your brain might not be as sharp as it was on the start line \u2013 so lock in on these standards to avoid heartbreak at the final hurdle.\n\nIt is the racer\u2019s responsibility to ensure they have selected the correct weight of wall ball relevant to their division.\n\nThe racer must start by standing tall (hips and knees extended), holding the wall ball with both hands i.e. it is not permitted for racers to pick the wall ball up from the ground and immediately throw it at the target.\n\nThe racer then squats below parallel and throws the ball (with both hands) as they stand up, striking the correct target on the wallball rig \u2013 this is counted as one repetition.\n\nEach wall ball throw must strike the designated target i.e. female racers must hit their target in the strike zone, male racers must hit their target in the strike zone.\n\nAfter the ball touches the target, the racer either catches the ball and initiates the movement again or alternately, the racer allows the wall ball to hit the ground before starting the movement again i.e. standing tall, hips and knees extended before commencing the squat. Racers are not permitted to catch the ball after it bounces and continue with the next repetition.\n\nAt the bottom position of the squat, the racer\u2019s hips must descend lower than their knees (also known as; below parallel or below 90\u00b0)\n\nWhere no digital targets are in use, racers may only proceed to the Finisher Stage once their Judge confirms that 100 valid Wall Ball repetitions have been completed.\n\nRacers are permitted to remove their shoes once they arrive at their designated target. The racer must place the shoes under the rig. After completing 100 valid wall balls the racer is required to take their shoes with them to the Finisher Stage \u2013 racers are not permitted to return to the wall ball area after completing their race.\n\nRacers must NOT run underneath the wall ball rig when making their way to the Finisher Stage \u2013 they must go via the outside of the wall ball rig.\n\n**Penalties:**\n\nBreaching any of the above rules will result in a \u2018no rep\u2019 call.\n\n## How to nail your Wall Balls form\n\nForm matters more than ever. These are the final reps of your race \u2013 fatigue is high, focus is critical. Smart, efficient technique keeps you moving.\n\n**Setup:**\n\nStand facing the target with feet shoulder-width apart\n\nHold the ball at chest height with elbows tucked\n\nEyes on the target to maintain posture\n\n**Movement:**\n\nInitiate with a full-depth squat\n\nDrive up through heels, extending hips and knees\n\nUse momentum to throw the ball to the target\n\nCatch smoothly, absorb the force, and cycle into the next rep\n\nStay smooth, not rushed. The more rhythm you build, the easier the volume feels.\n\n## Best exercises to improve Wall Balls performance\n\nThis is a high-volume, high-fatigue movement. Your prep should build leg stamina, shoulder endurance, and squat mechanics.\n\nDumbbell thrusters\n\nDumbbell front squats\n\nWall ball EMOMs (every minute on the minute) \u2013 aim for large volumes of unbroken reps with short rests\n\nOverhead med ball tosses\n\n## Pacing tips for the HYROX Wall Balls\n\nWhen you\u2019re gassed, wall balls can feel never-ending. Break them up intelligently and stay strict with form to avoid penalties.\n\n**Our tip:** Break it down \u2013 25, 15, 10, 5 \u2013 and stay sharp with your form, ensuring your thighs hit parallel on each squat. No one wants a 'no rep' call from the judges when you're this close to the finish line.\n\nFocus on breathing every rep or two\n\nKeep elbows tight to avoid shoulder burnout\n\nUse short, intentional breaks \u2013 don\u2019t wait for failure\n\n## Common Wall Balls mistakes to avoid\n\nEven one no-rep this close to the finish can be demoralizing. Clean technique and mental focus matter here more than ever.\n\nRushing and cutting squat depth\n\nLetting the ball fall out of your hands between reps\n\nMisjudging target height under fatigue\n\nTaking too long to reset between sets\n\n## How to work Wall Balls into your training\n\nBuild volume and form under fatigue by including wall balls in conditioning pieces, finishers, and race-simulation workouts.\n\nHigh-rep AMRAPs with wall balls as the base\n\nCouplet workouts like wall balls + rowing or burpees\n\nTabata-style intervals for sprint sets\n\nPyramid sets (10-20-30-20-10) to train pacing\n\n*Centr is the official HYROX equipment provider \u2013 train with the same gear you\u2019ll use on race day.*\n\n## Get race-day ready: Wall Balls workout\n\nThis descending ladder keeps intensity high while training control under fatigue. Stack this burner onto the end of your workout \u2013 simulate race-day conditions by performing Wall Balls when your body is fatigued.\n\n**For time:**\n\n40 wall balls\n\n30 wall balls\n\n20 wall balls\n\n10 wall balls\n\nRest 60 seconds between sets. Focus on clean reps, deep squats, and no dropped balls. Time yourserlf for the full 100 so you have a point of reference for race day pacing.\n\n## The best HYROX training program\n\nCentr is your one-stop shop for certified HYROX training.

          "snippet": "In this article, we will look at the sled pull station in HYROX, and how to appropriately train for it.\n\nThe sled pull has caught out many athletes competing at HYROX. It\u2019s certainly an area where it\u2019s very easy to lose a lot of time. Along with the wall balls and sled push, the sled pull is one of the stations which has the largest variability in completion time. That means, however, that\u2019s it\u2019s an area where you can make up a lot of time, relative to others in the race, if you manage to nail it. It is, therefore, worthy of your focus.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look\u2026\n\n**HYROX Sled Pull Weights**\n\nThe sled pull weights, by category, in HYROX are as follows:\n\nWomen: 78kg incl. sled\n\nWomen Pro: 103kg incl. sled\n\nMen: 103kg incl. sled\n\nMen Pro: 153kg incl. sled\n\nMixed Doubles: 103kg incl. sled\n\nWomen Doubles: 78kg incl. sled\n\nMen Doubles: 103kg incl. sled\n\nRelay: 78kg / 103kg (F/M) incl. sled\n\n**Sled Pull Standards**\n\nYou must cover 50 meters in total. This is broken up into 4 lengths of 12.5meters.\n\nThe sled pull is the third station in a HYROX race. By the time you reach it you will have run a total of 3km, completed 1km on the Ski Erg, and a 50 meter sled push (plus any time in the \u201cRoxzone\u201d).\n\nWhen you enter the sled pull zone, you must use the lane assigned to you by a judge. Both the sled and participant should be completely behind the line prior to beginning. You must then pull the sled the length of your lane, past the line, walk back to the other end of your lane and pull the sled back. You then need to repeat this process to make up the 50 meters. Resting at any time during this process is fine if you wish. It is important, whilst pulling the sled, that you do not step outside of your designated area at the end of your lane. Athletes must not step on the solid white line at the end of the athlete\u2019s box.\n\nHere is a HYROX video covering the sled pull standards:\n\n**Sled Pull Standards**\n\nYou must cover 50 meters in total.

Depending on your category, this does take a good amount of strength. It likely won\u2019t be possible \u2013 at least for the full 50 meters \u2013 for most competitors, especially in the Pro division.\n\nThe second option is to reach for the rope with your hands, then pull the sled towards you using a hip extension but keeping your feet planted on the floor.\n\nThe third option is to hold the rope and use your legs to pull, stepping back in the small amount of area that you have.\n\nAnd the final option is a combination of the first 3 techniques (hip extension, and step back while using your arms as much as possible as you do).\n\nCheck out the video below for a demonstration the 3 main techniques\u2026\n\n**Sled Pull Difficulties**\n\nThere are a few reasons that the sled pull causes problems for HYROX competitors:\n\n\u2013 The flooring (i.e. carpet) on which you need to push the sled has seemingly been designed to be about as difficult to pull a sled on as possible! It is far less smooth than the flooring found in most gyms. This makes the sled feel MUCH heavier than it actually is. If there\u2019s one piece of advice I could give to someone entering their first HYROX competition, it\u2019s to expect the sleds to feel heavier than you\u2019re imagining.\n\n\u2013 In some cases, the carpet can bunch up whilst you are pulling the sled along it, thus adding even more resistance.\n\n\u2013 The competitor hasn\u2019t trained\n\n*compromised* sled pulling. Pulling a heavy sled for 50 meters is one thing. Doing it having already run a total of 3km, covered 1km on the Ski erg, and pushed a heavy sled for 50 meters is quite another.\n\n\u2013 The rope used to pull the sled at HYROX is particularly long (the length of the 12.5m track) and does have some give / elasticity in it. This can make the first few pulls of the sled, in particular, feel a little odd if you aren\u2019t used to it.\n\n\u2013 You have a pretty small area in which you can stand / move when pulling the sled (roughly 1.8m long). Once the rope is bunching up behind you, stepping back can become much tricker. Many athletes find themselves tripping over.\n\n\u2013 The sled pull is one of the stations in HYROX where some skill / technique is particularly helpful. Learning to pull the sled in an appropriate way, whilst managing the rope around you, and staying in the small box you are allowed in, does take some practice and experience.\n\n**Sled Pull Training Tips**\n\n**Get the Weight Right**\n\nWhen training for the HYROX sled pull, you\u2019ll want to ensure you are using an appropriate amount of weight. To achieve an equivalent feel to that which you\u2019ll experience at HYROX, you\u2019ll need to consider the flooring that you are training on. If it\u2019s anything smoother than a VERY resistant carpet, then you\u2019ll likely want to add weight over and above your race day weight. Speaking from personal experience, when training at my gym I need to add an additional 35kg to the sled for it to feel equivalent to race weight (but this will vary depending on your rope, sled and flooring!).\n\n**Get the Timing and Effort Right**\n\nYou never truly know how the sleds at HYROX are going to feel until you\u2019re actually there, in the race. But in training, you can aim to replicate the effort you put into the pull, and the time you want to spend pulling for. That doesn\u2019t mean you need to spend 4 minutes (or however long it will be) each time you do a set in the gym, but rather just aim for a hard effort, for X amount of time, for a number of sets. In some sessions that length of time might be shorter than other sessions (in which case the weight might be heavier). Focusing on your time in the set, as opposed to whether you\u2019ve replicated the weight of the event, is a much better use of your mental energy.\n\n**Example Sled Pull Training Sessions**\n\nWhen training the sled pull in isolation, there are obviously a variety of options in terms of sets, length of push, and weight used. Periodisation and progression in your training is important.\n\nAn example session might be to pick a heavier weight than what you\u2019ll be competing with and completing 5 sets of 20 meters as quickly as possible, with 2 minutes rest between each set.\n\nYou\u2019ll also want to be doing some compromised sled pulls so you can practice pulling the sled under fatigue. A simplistic example of what this might look like could be a 500-meter run at your approximate race pace, followed by a 30-meter sled pull (at race weight). And repeating this for 4 rounds, with no rest in between. This helps to train both the sled pull in a compromised state, as well as your compromised running.\n\nThere are obviously numerous options in terms of what a training session might look like. However, using heavier weights, fine tuning your technique, and practicing compromised sled pulls are all important considerations.\n\n**Sled Pull Training Without a Sled**\n\nAside from sled work, you can, and likely should, spend time on pull strength. This will involve incorporating exercises such pull ups, bent over rows, single arm dumbbell rows, and possibly rope grip pull ups.\n\nIt\u2019s not all just pulling though; your lower body will be working to help move that sled, so posterior chain exercises \u2013 such as deadlifts \u2013 can also be important. These exercises become even more important if you don\u2019t have a sled that you can regularly train with.\n\n**Race Day Tips**\n\nThe sled pull is just the third station in an eight-station event. By the time you reach it you\u2019ll likely be only 30% (ish) into your total race time. If you fatigue yourself too much on the sled pull, there is a LONG way still to go. You can\u2019t really win the race by doing well on the sleds, but you can certainly lose it. Therefore, it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that you don\u2019t necessarily want to get the 50-meters done as quickly as you possibly can. Of course, you don\u2019t want to go too slow, but pushing yourself to your max, and leaving nothing in the tank for the rest of the race, can be a mistake. That said, it tends not to be quite as taxing on the legs as the sled push, so you can normally push yourself a little more here.\n\nI\u2019ve already mentioned it above, but it\u2019s well worth reiterating, especially if you\u2019ve never done a HYROX before, that the first few pulls on the rope can feel a little strange as the rope is so long (and a little elastic).\n\nAlso, be careful when you step back in your box area, especially as the rope starts to bunch up around you. It can often cause competitors to trip over. Moving out of your area before you have completed the pull can result in a penalty.\n\nFinally, try to minimise time between pulls of the rope, and when you are walking to the other end of your lane. Of course, some rest may be needed but you want to be conscious of letting too much time slip by when you aren\u2019t actually moving the sled.\n\nI really hope that helps.

          "snippet": "As I write this, in April 2022, Hunter McIntyre has just broken the HYROX world record in an incredible time of 55mins 09secs (update \u2013 he has since beaten that \u2013 you can see the list of up to date HYROX World Records here).\n\nAfter picking my jaw up off the floor at just how impressive this was, I started to wonder \u2013 considering all the data we have available to us \u2013 is there anything we can learn from the best of the best in the sport, other than just \u201cget fitter\u201d.\n\nIn the same way a non-league footballer might watch clips of Harry Kane to work out how he positions himself on the pitch, or a 28-handicap golfer might watch the type of shots Rory McIlroy plays around the green, all in an attempt to improve their performance, could there be anything that the average HYROX competitor might be able to pick up from the Elites of the competition?\n\nIs it just running they are primarily better at? Which of the functional exercises do they really excel at, and which are worthy our focus over and above some of the others? Are the Elites noticeably better on run 5 than run 8, or something along those lines?\n\nSo, I started to gather some data\u2026\n\n__The Method__\n\n__The Method__\n\nI\u2019ll say upfront, I\u2019m not a mathematician. There\u2019s a chance that any mathematicians reading this will have heart palpitations at just how flawed my methodology is. Maybe I should have used means instead of medians, or greater sample sizes. Maybe I lack statistical significance.\n\nI\u2019m also not at the Elite level in HYROX.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry as I\u2019m not going to be making any conclusions or giving any specific advice. If you want specific advice for your situation, check out our coaching options. Rather I\u2019ll just make some observations and raise some questions, that will hopefully help you in your own performance, training and race planning.\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s what I\u2019ve done\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve taken, from the HYROX leaderboard, 15 of the best HYROX performances ever \u2013 for both female and male at Pro level. I\u2019ve then taken the median of their times for each run and functional station. This group I\u2019m calling \u201c\n\n**Elite**\u201d.\n\nI repeated this for a sample of athletes who achieved a time broadly similar to what HYROX have said is the average time achieved at Pro level (roughly 90mins). This group I\u2019m calling \u201c\n\n**Average**\u201d.\n\nI\u2019ve deliberately avoided including any athlete more than once. For example, Hunter McIntyre has 5 of the top 10 times ever, at the time of writing, but I\u2019ve only included the fastest of those. I\u2019ve also avoided anyone who got a time penalty to avoid skewing the data.\n\n__The Findings__\n\n__The Findings__\n\nHere were the results\u2026\n\n|Men|Women|\n|--|--|\n|Elite|Average|Difference|Elite|Average|Difference|\n|Running 1|00:03:24|00:03:44|00:00:20|00:03:38|00:04:46|00:01:08|\n|Running 2|00:03:40|00:04:43|00:01:03|00:04:07|00:05:14|00:01:07|\n|Running 3|00:03:54|00:05:37|00:01:43|00:04:22|00:05:28|00:01:06|\n|Running 4|00:03:50|00:05:37|00:01:47|00:04:24|00:05:29|00:01:05|\n|Running 5|00:03:55|00:05:33|00:01:38|00:04:28|00:05:39|00:01:11|\n|Running 6|00:03:50|00:05:21|00:01:31|00:04:22|00:05:37|00:01:15|\n|Running 7|00:03:58|00:05:32|00:01:34|00:04:23|00:05:39|00:01:16|\n|Running 8|00:04:15|00:06:19|00:02:04|00:04:43|00:06:17|00:01:34|\n|Run Total|00:30:46|00:42:26|00:11:40|00:34:27|00:44:09|00:09:42|\n|1000m SkiErg|00:03:47|00:04:17|00:00:30|00:04:12|00:04:51|00:00:39|\n|2x25m Sled Push|00:02:45|00:03:40|00:00:55|00:03:00|00:03:48|00:00:47|\n|2x25m Sled Pull|00:03:14|00:06:31|00:03:17|00:03:54|00:06:36|00:02:42|\n|80m Burpee Broad Jump|00:02:21|00:05:15|00:02:54|00:03:11|00:04:53|00:01:42|\n|1000m Row|00:03:58|00:04:35|00:00:37|00:04:29|00:05:12|00:00:43|\n|200m Farmers Carry|00:01:37|00:02:32|00:00:55|00:01:57|00:02:45|00:00:48|\n|100m Sandbag Lunges|00:03:03|00:05:22|00:02:19|00:03:35|00:05:25|00:01:50|\n|Wall Balls|00:04:25|00:07:38|00:03:13|00:03:50|00:06:20|00:02:30|\n|Roxzone Time|00:02:54|00:06:58|00:04:04|00:03:47|00:06:12|00:02:25|\n|Total|00:58:50|01:29:14|00:30:24|01:06:22|01:30:11|00:23:49|\nYou can draw your own conclusions from that data if you wish but here\u2019s some of what I thought were potentially the most useful findings\u2026\n\n__Running__\n\n__Running__\n\nRunning is a large part of HYROX (it takes up 52% of the average elite race) and, surprise surprise, the Elites are better at running than the Average. Over the 8km in a HYROX race the men are nearly 12mins quicker and women nearly 10 mins quicker. Most people will have expected this, so I won\u2019t dwell on advising you just to become a faster runner. But it is, of course, important.\n\nI do, however, think it\u2019s worth pointing out that the Elites sampled run at an average pace of 3.51mins/km (men), or 4.18mins/km (women). I feel almost embarrassed to say this as I\u2019m nowhere near the standard of these athletes, but it is a running pace that I personally can get my head around. It\n\n*feels* achievable to do that (at least if I just look at the running portion in isolation).\n\nWhen Eliud Kipchoge ran a marathon in under 2 hours, his average splits were a pace of 2.51mins per km \u2013 for the length of a marathon. That I simply can\u2019t get my head around. But the Elites running pace in HYROX I (perhaps deludedly) can.\n\nIf we look at it in the context of world records for the Marathon, Half Marathon, and half distance Ironman (where the running portion is a half marathon, after a 1.9km swim and 90km bike ride), you can see the running split times are longer in HYROX, despite it being a shorter event\u2026\n\nOf course, that may not be a completely fair comparison. They are different events, HYROX has not been going for a long time (and we may eventually see much quicker running splits), and I\u2019m comparing World Records with an average of 15 Elite HYROX competitors. But I still think it has some relevance. And what I\u2019m really trying to stress is that you can still be very good at HYROX without being one of the world\u2019s best runners \u2013 there is more than just running for you to think about.\n\n**I suspect though that the Elite HYROX athletes are world class at compromised running.** To run that pace consistently through the race, after all the functional exercises, is very impressive. I wonder if Kipchoge could do that. Or even if Kipchoge could have got to the end of the race. Maybe he\u2019d have had to bail out at the sled push?! Who knows.\n\n**To summarise from a running perspective, improving your running is likely important if you want to move yourself closer to the Elite HYROX standard. But I don\u2019t think you need to be world class at running to be world class at HYROX. You do, however, need to be very good at compromised running, and have the endurance to sustain a solid running pace over an event that lasts 54mins+. In this article we talk more about compromised running and how to train for it.**\n\n__Pacing__\n\n__Pacing__\n\nIt feels to me as if the Elites may be better at pacing themselves than the average athlete, especially on the first run. This is certainly the case if we just look at the men \u2013 women don\u2019t seem to suffer so much with this problem.\n\nYou can see that the blue line is much flatter for the Elite men, indicating their run times are more consistent across the race. The first 1km run for the Average men (orange line), in particular, is much quicker than their average splits.\n\n** What impact could this be having on the rest of their race? Should they be conserving their energy better? **\n\nThe fact that women seem to be better at pacing themselves than men is no surprise. This study showed that women were 18.33% better than men at keeping an even pace in a marathon.\n\nIs pacing even important? In an event as long as HYROX, almost certainly. The consensus seems to be that for longer events (such as HYROX) not starting out too quickly is a sensible decision. For shorter distances, a faster start (to an extent) can be ok, but as most competitors are taking 60mins+ for HYROX, it is likely you want to be holding yourself back a little on the first couple of runs.\n\n**Could this be why the Average woman is much closer in time to an Elite Woman (23mins 49secs in our data), than an Average Man is to an Elite Man (30mins 24secs)? Click here to read our article on how to appropriately pace the running at HYROX. **\n\n__Ski Pace__\n\n__Ski Pace__\n\nIt\u2019s harder to gauge but I suspect the men are going a touch too quick on the SkiErg too, relative to their overall ability. The SkiErg has the smallest difference in times between Elite and Average competitors. This might be expected. However, as we know the men are almost certainly starting out too quickly on their first run, it\u2019s quite possible this is carrying over to the Ski as well (which is the first of the functional stations).\n\nThe men are 30 seconds slower on the Ski, and women are 39 secs slower. I know personally if I go maybe 5 secs/500m slower on the SkiErg, it significantly lowers my heart rate, even though that only equates to 10 seconds slower over 1km.\n\nIf you are able, I would suggest experimenting with your ski split times in training, and see how much better you feel if you go a little slower than you\u2019re planning to for your next race. What impact does an extra, say, 10 seconds on your 1km time do for your heart rate and how you feel afterwards? 10 seconds in the context of a HYROX, is a pretty small number, and could save you a greater amount of time in the remainder of the race.\n\n__Sled Push / Sled Pull__\n\n__Sled Push / Sled Pull__\n\nThe sled-based events at HYROX are the 2 main areas that benefit from an athlete\u2019s strength. So, you might expect the difference in times between the Average and Elite to be broadly similar on both the sled push and sled pull. But it\u2019s not. Average men are 55secs slower on push, and a whopping 3.17mins slower on the pull. The women are 47secs slower on push, and 2.42mins slower on the pull.\n\nLooked at another way, Elite men spend 18% longer on sled pull than their sled push, and Elite women spend 30% longer. But the Average spend 78% (men) or 74% (women) longer on the pull than the push!\n\nAs I see it, there are a few things to think about here:\n\n\u2013 Are Average athletes pushing too hard on the sled push, relative to their strength levels? And if so, could that be screwing them up for the rest of the race?\n\n\u2013 Or are the Average just much worse at the sled pull? In which case, working on technique, pull strength and posterior chain is very important.\n\n**For most people reading this, what the Average athlete is doing doesn\u2019t really matter. But could something similar be happening in your performance? Is your sled pull to sled push ratio similar to that of an Elite athlete? If not, could you be pushing too hard on the sled pull, or neglecting the work needed to improve your sled pull times?**\n\n__Roxzone__\n\n__Roxzone__\n\nAs hesitant as I\u2019ve been to give advice in this article, I will now break that and say one thing; If you want a good time, don\u2019t f*** about in the Roxzone!\n\nThe difference between the Elites and Averages in time spent in the Roxzone is quite startling. Average men spend 4.04mins longer in there, and Average women 2mins 25secs. That seems far too long.\n\nThe size of the Roxzone does vary by venue but I would roughly estimate it to be 800m on average. Therefore, it\u2019s a reasonable expectation for your Roxzone time to broadly be 80% of your average 1km split times. For Elites the data shows 75% (men) and 88% (Women). But for Average athletes it is 131% (men) and 112% (women)!\n\nThe Roxzone was certainly a bigger area than I\u2019d been expecting prior to my first event. Personally speaking, I suspect I subconsciously started to relax a little after each run as soon as I entered the Roxzone. It wasn\u2019t a conscious thing, but my Roxzone time of 6 minutes in my first race suggests that it was happening. That is something that the Elites never do. They stop running as soon as they are about to start the next exercise. And as soon as they\u2019ve finished it, they start again. Roxzone or running track are treated the same; for running on.\n\nOne enticing thing about the Roxzone is the drinks provided there. In a hot HYROX race it becomes very tempting to stop at the water table and sip on a cool drink before setting off again. The Elites may grab a water on the way past, but I doubt they are stopping for a relaxing beverage and a chat.\n\nTo be fair, as the Elites complete the race in a faster time, they have less need to take on as much water, so that may be a factor here, but it can\u2019t explain the difference entirely.\n\n**If you\u2019ve entered a HYROX in the past, have you spent too long in the Roxzone? How could you speed that up? Does the time you spent in the zone reasonably compare to how quickly you might run 800m(ish)? **\n\nGoing forward, I plan to think of the Roxzone as just another functional exercise but one I want to win. Rather than relax as I enter the Roxzone, its game on. In fact, as I write this, I\u2019m wondering if in I\u2019ll have a game of \u201cfloor is lava\u201d with myself where I imagine the floor in the Roxzone is lava and I have to get out of there as quickly as I can. Of course, it may mean I end up doing the runs or functional stations slower, but it\u2019s worth a go!\n\n__Summary__\n\n__Summary__\n\nThe data I\u2019ve gathered does show that Elites are better than the Average at\n\n__all__ the stations, and __all __the runs. That\u2019s probably to be expected. All areas are important in improving your times.\n\nAside from what\u2019s already been mentioned above, there is a particularly large difference in times on the Wall Balls and Burpee Broad Jumps, meaning these should likely be prioritised, for most people, over and above working on SkiErg and Rowing, for example (where the differences are much smaller).\n\nIt will obviously be different for each person, as we all have our own strengths and weaknesses, but to summarise where I think some of the\n\n*lowest hanging fruit* is in bringing an Average athlete closer to Elite level it would be:\n\n\u2013 Working on compromised running\n\n\u2013 Improved pacing (men especially)\n\n\u2013 Improved performance on the sled pull (with an aim to get your sled pull to sled push ratio more closely aligned with that of the Elites)\n\n\u2013 Reduced time in the Roxzone (bringing your Roxzone time to somewhere around 75-90% of your average 1km running time across the event)\n\nIf you\u2019d like any help with your performances in HYROX, we can\u2019t promise to make you Elite but we\u2019ll do our best to maximise your potential.

Let me compile the full document.\n\n---\n\n# HYROX Workout Stations: Complete Tactical Breakdown for AI Coach Knowledge Base\n\n> **Purpose:** This document serves as the definitive tactical reference for an AI-powered Hyrox coach. It covers optimal technique, common mistakes, target times, muscle group impact, and training progressions for all eight workout stations. Data is sourced from Hyrox race analytics (700,000+ results via HyroxDataLab), coaching platforms (Rox Lyfe, TheProgrm, Hybrid Athlete Club, OnlyGains.ai), Centr (official Hyrox equipment provider), and elite athlete insights.\n\n---\n\n## Station 1: SkiErg (1000m)\n\nThe SkiErg is the first functional station you encounter after your opening 1km run. It sets the tone for the entire race. Because it's Station 1, many athletes make the critical error of going out too hard\u2014burning through glycogen and spiking heart rate before seven more stations and seven more 1km runs remain.\n\n### Optimal Technique\n\nThe SkiErg stroke consists of two phases: **the pull** and **the recovery**.\n\n**The Pull Phase:**\n- **Initiate with your lats**, not your arms. Think about pulling your elbows down toward your hips rather than yanking the handles with your biceps (OnlyGains.ai).\n- Simultaneously **hinge at the hips**, driving your weight slightly back. The hip hinge generates the majority of your power\u2014your arms are merely transmitting force.\n- Pull the handles down past your thighs in a smooth arc.\n- Keep your core braced throughout to maintain power transfer from upper body to handles.\n\n**The Recovery Phase:**\n- Allow arms to rise naturally with the handles.\n- Return to a standing position with controlled momentum.\n- Don't rush\u2014let the flywheel do some work on the return.\n- Reset at the top before initiating the next stroke.\n\n**Breathing Rhythm:**\nAdopt one breath cycle per stroke. Exhale forcefully on the pull (as you hinge down), inhale on the recovery (as you stand back up). Establish this pattern within the first 10 strokes and maintain it throughout. Holding your breath is one of the fastest ways to spike heart rate unnecessarily (OnlyGains.ai).\n\n**Stroke Rate:**\nTarget approximately **30\u201335 strokes per minute** at race pace. Long, powerful strokes beat short, frantic ones. Quality over quantity\u2014each stroke should feel like a controlled, powerful movement rather than rapid arm-flailing.\n\n### Common Efficiency Mistakes and How to Fix Them\n\n1. **Arms-first pulling:** Athletes yank the handles with biceps/shoulders instead of engaging lats and hip hinge. **Fix:** Cue \"elbows to hips\" and think of a deadlift motion. The arms connect; the hips power.\n\n2. **Starting too fast:** Sprinting the first 200m at max effort and dying by 500m. **Fix:** Remember this is Station 1 of 8. Start at 70\u201375% effort and build. Target a negative split\u2014faster second half than first (OnlyGains.ai).\n\n3. **Standing too tall:** Not hinging at the hips, losing power from the core and posterior chain. **Fix:** Exaggerate the hip hinge. Your torso should reach roughly 45\u00b0 of forward lean at the bottom of each stroke.\n\n4. **Choppy, short strokes:** Rapid abbreviated pulls generating minimal power per stroke. **Fix:** Slow down, extend the range of motion, and aim for 30\u201335 SPM, not 45+.\n\n5. **Holding your breath:** Causes early fatigue and heart rate spikes. **Fix:** Conscious, rhythmic breathing\u2014one breath cycle per stroke, established in the first few reps.\n\n### Target Times by Performance Level\n\n| Level | 1000m Time (Isolated) | Pace/500m | In-Race Estimate (+10\u201320%) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Elite (Pro Division) | Under 3:00 | Under 1:30 | 3:30\u20134:20 |\n| Advanced | 3:00\u20133:30 | 1:30\u20131:45 | 3:30\u20134:15 |\n| Intermediate | 3:30\u20134:15 | 1:45\u20132:07 | 4:15\u20135:00 |\n| Beginner | 4:15\u20135:00 | 2:07\u20132:30 | 5:00\u20136:00 |\n| First-Timer | 5:00+ | 2:30+ | 6:00+ |\n\n*Data from OnlyGains.ai and competitive.fit. Elite male race averages: ~4:25; average male HYROX finisher: ~6:19 (competitive.fit). Elite Pro men have recorded sub-3:50 in race conditions. Rox Lyfe elite Pro data shows median of 3:47 for top-15 men.*\n\n### Pacing Strategy\n\n- **0\u2013300m (70\u201375% effort):** Let heart rate settle from the run. Splits around 1:55\u20132:05/500m.\n- **300\u2013700m (80\u201385% effort):** Find sustainable race rhythm. Splits around 1:50\u20132:00/500m.\n- **700\u20131000m (90%+ effort):** Push knowing you're finishing soon. Splits around 1:45\u20131:55/500m.\n\nDon't stare at the monitor constantly\u2014check every 250m (OnlyGains.ai).\n\n### Muscle Groups Taxed and Impact on Subsequent Run\n\n**Primary:** Latissimus dorsi, posterior deltoids, triceps, core (rectus abdominis, obliques), hip extensors (glutes, hamstrings).\n**Secondary:** Forearm flexors (grip on handles), erector spinae.\n\n**Carryover to Run 2:** The SkiErg primarily taxes the upper body and core, with moderate hip flexor/extensor fatigue from the hinge pattern. Most athletes find their legs relatively fresh for Run 2, but their heart rate and breathing can be elevated. The key is managing effort so cardiovascular stress doesn't tank your second run pace.\n\n### Training Benchmarks and Drills\n\n- **Pacing Practice:** 4 \u00d7 500m SkiErg, 2 min rest. Goal: hit the same split (within 3 sec) on all four rounds.\n- **Race Simulation:** 1km run \u2192 1000m SkiErg \u2192 1km run. Track transition times.\n- **Endurance Builder:** 2000m SkiErg at conversational pace, every 500m do 10 push-ups.\n- **Interval Power:** 8 \u00d7 250m SkiErg, 1:1 work:rest, build speed each round (OnlyGains.ai).\n\n---\n\n## Station 2: Sled Push (4 \u00d7 12.5m = 50m Total)\n\nThe sled push is the first truly heavy strength station. Weights are significant: **Women Open 102kg, Men Open/Women Pro 152kg, Men Pro 202kg** (all including sled weight). The Hyrox competition carpet creates substantially more friction than typical gym floors, meaning the sled feels heavier than athletes expect. This station has one of the highest time variabilities and can easily cost several minutes if technique is poor.\n\n### Optimal Body Angle, Arm Position, Foot Placement, and Driving Technique\n\n**Body Angle:** Achieve a **45-degree lean** with hips below shoulders. This creates a horizontal force vector, pushing the sled forward rather than down into the carpet. When you stand too tall, gravity works against you\u2014you push down into the floor, creating more friction (HyroxTrainingPlans.com).\n\n**Arm Position:** Elbows bent at **90\u2013120 degrees**. Arms act as connectors, not pushers. Your legs generate 4\u00d7 more power than your shoulders. Straight, locked-out arms force deltoids and triceps to engage heavily\u2014they fatigue fast. Bent arms transmit leg power to the sled (HyroxTrainingPlans.com).\n\n**Hand Position:** Hands shoulder-width apart, firm grip but not a death grip (save forearm energy for sled pull and later stations).\n\n**Foot Placement:** Take **rapid 6\u20138 inch steps** maintaining 120+ steps per minute cadence. Long strides create a stop-start pattern\u2014you decelerate between steps. Short, rapid steps maintain constant forward pressure (HyroxTrainingPlans.com).\n\n**Starting Position:** Set your position BEFORE the first push\u2014already at 45\u00b0 angle, hands placed, core braced. The first 3 steps are the hardest (breaking static friction). Starting from standing wastes the crucial first push.\n\n**Head Position:** Neutral, eyes 6 feet ahead on the ground. Don't look up\u2014it pulls you into an upright position.\n\n### Continuous Push vs. Reset Between Lengths\n\nThe 50m is split into 4 \u00d7 12.5m legs with turns. At the turn, you must reposition. **Elite athletes minimize time at turns** by maintaining sled contact and immediately resetting body angle. The sled stops at each turn regardless, so the key is minimizing the time between the sled stopping and your next push beginning. Pre-set your body angle before driving again. Don't stand up fully at the turns\u2014stay low, reposition your feet, and go.\n\n### Common Mistakes\n\n1. **Standing too upright:** Pushes force downward into carpet instead of horizontally. **Fix:** 45-degree lean, hips below shoulders.\n2. **Locked arms / pushing from shoulders:** Treats the sled like a bench press. **Fix:** Bend elbows 90\u2013120\u00b0, let legs drive.\n3. **Long strides:** Creates stop-start pattern, losing momentum. **Fix:** Short, rapid 6\u20138 inch steps.\n4. **Not using legs:** Upper body pushing instead of leg driving. **Fix:** Think \"sprinter stance\"\u2014power comes from quads, glutes, and calves.\n5. **Grip too tight:** Burns forearms needed for sled pull. **Fix:** Firm but relaxed grip\u2014the sled isn't going anywhere.\n6. **Wrong starting position:** Standing then leaning in. **Fix:** Set 45\u00b0 position before first push.\n\n### Target Times by Performance Level\n\n| Level | Men (152kg) | Women (102kg) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Elite | 2:30\u20133:00 | 2:30\u20133:00 |\n| Advanced | 3:00\u20133:30 | 3:00\u20133:25 |\n| Intermediate | 3:30\u20134:30 | 3:30\u20134:30 |\n| Beginner/Recreational | 4:30\u20136:00+ | 4:30\u20136:00+ |\n\n*Elite data from HyroxDataLab: men 2:50\u20133:26, women 2:50\u20133:25. Rox Lyfe Pro elite median: men 2:45, women 3:00. Average HYROX finisher: men ~3:54, women ~4:13 (competitive.fit).*\n\n### Muscle Groups Taxed and Carryover to Next Run\n\n**Primary:** Quadriceps, glutes, calves, core (anti-extension).\n**Secondary:** Deltoids, triceps, erector spinae.\n\n**Carryover to Run 3:** The sled push is heavily quad-dominant. Athletes often experience significant quad burn and elevated heart rate entering Run 3. The first 200\u2013400m of the subsequent run typically feels sluggish. Training \"compromised running\" (running immediately after sled work) is critical. Expect Run 3 pace to be 10\u201320 seconds/km slower than Run 1.\n\n### Training Progressions\n\n- **Weeks 1\u20132 (Technique Focus):** 50% race weight, 4\u20135 sets of 25m, 2 min rest. Focus on body angle + arm position.\n- **Weeks 3\u20134 (Progressive Load):** 70\u2013100% race weight, 4\u20135 sets of 25m. Combine multiple technique cues.\n- **Weeks 5\u20138 (Race Specificity):** Full race weight, 4 \u00d7 12.5m (race format). Add 500m run before each set.\n- **Speed Work:** Lighter weight (60%), focus on maximizing step cadence.\n- **Overload:** 110\u2013120% race weight for shorter distances (2 \u00d7 12.5m) to build strength reserve.\n\n*Note: Gym floors are almost always smoother than Hyrox carpet. Add 20\u201335kg to match race-day feel (Rox Lyfe recommendation).*\n\n---\n\n## Station 3: Sled Pull (4 \u00d7 12.5m = 50m Total)\n\nThe sled pull is one of the most time-variable stations in Hyrox and the area where average athletes lose the most time relative to elites. Rox Lyfe data shows **elite Pro men at ~3:14 median vs. average Pro men at 6:31\u2014a 3:17 gap**, the largest of any station. Weights: **Women Open 78kg, Men Open/Women Pro 103kg, Men Pro 153kg** (including sled).\n\n### Hand-Over-Hand Technique vs. Hip Extension vs. Walk-Back\n\nThree primary techniques exist (TheProgrm, Hybrid Athlete Club):\n\n1. **Hand-Over-Hand (Arms Only):** Stand relatively upright, pull the rope hand over hand using biceps and back. Short, choppy pulls keep the sled moving. Best for athletes with **strong upper bodies** but can fatigue arms quickly. More suited to lighter sled weights (Open Women).\n\n2. **Hip Extension Method:** Grab the rope with arms nearly fully extended, then explosively extend hips (like a kettlebell swing/deadlift) while pulling through with arms. The hip extension creates inertia that the arms can then finish. **Most efficient for heavier weights** as it recruits the entire posterior chain. This is the preferred technique for most competitive athletes.\n\n3. **Walk-Back Method:** Hold the rope and physically walk backward in the small ~1.8m athlete box, using body weight and leg drive. Effective but space-limited\u2014you can only take 2\u20133 steps before hitting the boundary line.\n\n4. **Combination (Recommended for most):** Initiate with hip extension, finish with arm pull, and incorporate small backward steps. This distributes work across the most muscle groups and is the most sustainable over 50m.\n\n### Rope Management and Grip Strategies\n\n- **Take the slack out first:** The Hyrox rope is the full 12.5m length and has slight elasticity. Before your first pull, grab and tension the rope so the first real pull moves the sled immediately (Hybrid Athlete Club).\n- **Manage rope pile:** As you pull, rope accumulates behind/around you. Be deliberate about where it falls to avoid tripping\u2014a common race-day disaster (Rox Lyfe).\n- **Grip:** Use a firm but not death-grip hold. Chalk is permitted and strongly recommended. Alternate which hand leads if using hand-over-hand to distribute fatigue.\n- **Stay in your box:** Athletes must not step on the solid white line at the end of the athlete's box\u2014penalties apply.\n\n### Common Mistakes and Fixes\n\n1. **Long, sweeping arm pulls:** Wastes energy and creates a stop-start pattern. **Fix:** Short, quick, choppy pulls to maintain sled momentum.\n2. **Not using hips/legs:** Pulling purely with arms. **Fix:** Lean back and drive hips, using body weight as leverage.\n3. **Tripping on rope:** Rope piles behind feet. **Fix:** Practice rope management; step to the side of the pile, not on it.\n4. **Letting sled stop between pulls:** Static friction is much greater than kinetic friction. **Fix:** Keep pulls rapid enough that the sled never fully stops.\n5. **Underestimating the friction:** The Hyrox carpet makes sleds feel dramatically heavier than gym training. **Fix:** Train with added weight to simulate race-day friction (Rox Lyfe suggests +35kg on typical gym floors).\n\n### Target Times by Performance Level\n\n| Level | Men (103kg Open / 153kg Pro) | Women (78kg Open / 103kg Pro) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Elite | 3:00\u20133:50 | 3:30\u20134:15 |\n| Advanced | 3:50\u20134:45 | 4:15\u20135:00 |\n| Intermediate | 4:45\u20136:00 | 5:00\u20137:00 |\n| Beginner/Recreational | 6:00\u20138:00+ | 7:00\u20139:00+ |\n\n*HyroxDataLab elite: men 3:50\u20134:37, women 4:15\u20134:59. Average HYROX finisher: men ~6:12, women ~7:03 (competitive.fit). Rox Lyfe Pro elite median: men 3:14, women 3:54.*\n\n### Muscle Groups Taxed and Carryover to Next Run\n\n**Primary:** Biceps, forearm flexors (grip), latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, posterior deltoids, glutes, hamstrings (hip extension), erector spinae.\n**Secondary:** Quadriceps (walk-back method), core (anti-flexion).\n\n**Carryover to Run 4:** The sled pull hammers grip, biceps, and posterior chain. Forearm fatigue begins accumulating here and won't fully recover before farmers carry (Station 6). The posterior chain work can make the subsequent run feel surprisingly okay for the legs, but upper body tightness and elevated heart rate are common. The grip fatigue created here has a long tail effect across the remaining race.\n\n---\n\n## Station 4: Burpee Broad Jumps (80m)\n\nThis is widely regarded as **the most systemically fatiguing station** in Hyrox. It combines a full chest-to-ground burpee with a forward broad jump, repeated over 80 meters. Most athletes need **40\u201360 reps** to cover the distance, depending on jump length. It comes after 4km of running and three strength stations, and the physiological demand is enormous\u2014full-body muscular work combined with repeated impact and cardiovascular stress.\n\n### Optimal Technique\n\n**The Burpee Portion:**\n- Chest MUST touch the ground. Hands must be placed no more than 30cm in front of feet.\n- **Step-up method (recommended):** Step one leg up at a time after the chest-to-ground position. This is what most top athletes use because it conserves energy and keeps heart rate lower. Hyrox coach Meg Jacobi confirms: *\"Use the step-up method to conserve energy and keep your heart rate lower. Maintaining steady movement with fewer breaks will yield a better time overall\"* (Centr).\n- **Jump-up method:** Both feet jump forward simultaneously. Faster per rep, but dramatically spikes heart rate and is unsustainable for most over 80m.\n- Feet must be parallel on takeoff and landing\u2014no staggered takeoffs.\n\n**The Broad Jump Portion:**\n- Jump **forward**, not up. Vertical height is wasted energy that doesn't count toward the 80m.\n- Moderate jump distance (1.3\u20132.0m per rep) is more sustainable than maximum-effort jumps. If your max broad jump is 2.5m, aim for 1.5\u20131.8m per rep. This conserves leg power dramatically.\n- Land softly with bent knees to absorb impact and reduce cumulative joint stress.\n\n**Efficiency of Movement:**\n- Minimize the transition between landing and going down for the next burpee. The faster you establish a rhythm (land \u2192 hands down \u2192 chest down \u2192 step up \u2192 jump), the better.\n- No forward steps between reps are allowed.\n\n### Pacing Strategy\n\n**Steady tempo is king.** Rox Lyfe, Centr, and virtually every experienced Hyrox coach emphasize consistent pacing over a push-and-rest strategy. Going fast for 20m then resting 30 seconds is far worse than maintaining a sustainable rhythm throughout.\n\n- **Know your rep count:** Before race day, measure how many BBJs it takes you to cover 80m. If it takes 50 reps, break it into mental chunks (5 groups of 10, or 10 groups of 5).\n- **RPE target:** 7\u20138/10. You should feel like you're working hard but could sustain the pace for the full distance.\n- **If you must rest:** Rest lying chest-down on the floor, not standing. Heart rate lowers faster when lying down (Rox Lyfe). Short 5\u201310 second rests are better than one long 30-second break.\n\n### Common Mistakes\n\n1. **Jumping too high (not forward):** Wastes energy without gaining distance. **Fix:** Think \"long jump\" not \"high jump.\" Focus on forward distance.\n2. **Inefficient get-ups:** Struggling to stand from chest-to-ground. **Fix:** Practice the step-up: plant one foot close to your hands, drive up with that leg.\n3. **Starting too fast:** Going all-out for the first 20m, then crashing. **Fix:** Set a metronome-like rhythm from rep 1. Aim for the same effort on rep 1 and rep 50.\n4. **Too-long jumps:** Max-effort jumps fatigue quads and spike heart rate. **Fix:** Use 60\u201370% of your max jump distance.\n5. **Hands too far from feet:** Placing hands far forward before the burpee wastes distance and energy. **Fix:** Hands placed no more than 30cm in front of feet (this is also the rule).\n\n### Target Times by Performance Level\n\n| Level | Men | Women |\n|---|---|---|\n| Elite (Pro) | 2:21\u20134:00 | 3:11\u20135:15 |\n| Advanced | 4:00\u20135:00 | 5:00\u20136:00 |\n| Intermediate | 5:00\u20136:30 | 6:00\u20137:30 |\n| Beginner/Recreational | 6:30\u20139:00+ | 7:30\u201310:00+ |\n\n*HyroxDataLab elite: men 4:00\u20134:37, women 5:15\u20135:57. Average HYROX finisher: ~5:23 for both genders (competitive.fit). Rox Lyfe Pro elite median: men 2:21, women 3:11\u2014note these are the absolute best in the world. 2026 average Men's Open: 5:45, Women's Open: 7:09 (hyroxy.com/TheRoxZone data).*\n\n### Muscle Groups Taxed\n\n**Primary:** Quadriceps (jumping, standing), chest/pectorals (lowering to ground), hip flexors, glutes, hamstrings.\n**Secondary:** Triceps (push-up portion), shoulders, core (stabilization), calves.\n**Systemic:** This is the station that creates the highest cardiovascular demand. Heart rate will reach near-maximal levels. It taxes both the aerobic and anaerobic systems heavily.\n\n**Carryover to Run 5:** Run 5 (after BBJ) is often the slowest run of the race. Legs are heavy from jumping, heart rate is elevated, and there's a psychological weight of knowing you're only halfway through. Elite athletes manage compromised running here; recreational athletes often walk portions of Run 5. Training compromised running after BBJ sets is essential.\n\n---\n\n## Station 5: Rowing (1000m)\n\nThe rowing station is the **only station where you sit down** in the entire Hyrox race. It comes at the race's midpoint\u2014after five 1km runs and four functional stations. Smart athletes treat it as tactical recovery. Foolish athletes either waste it by going too easy (5+ minutes) or blow up by sprinting it and imploding during the farmer's carry. The Concept2 RowErg is the machine used at all events.\n\n### Optimal Technique: Drive Sequence, Stroke Rate, Damper Setting\n\n**The Drive Sequence (Power Phase):**\nThe rowing stroke is **85% legs, 10% core, 5% arms** (OnlyGains.ai). The sequence is always: **Legs \u2192 Back \u2192 Arms.**\n\n1. **The Catch (start):** Shins vertical, knees bent, arms extended, shoulders forward, core engaged, back straight.\n2. **Leg drive:** Push with your legs FIRST. The handle doesn't move until your legs extend.\n3. **Back swing:** Once legs are almost straight, lean back slightly (to 1 o'clock position).\n4. **Arm pull:** Pull handle to lower chest as the final motion.\n\n**The Recovery (Return):**\nReverse sequence: **Arms \u2192 Back \u2192 Legs.**\n- Arms extend first, body rocks forward, then legs bend last as you slide back.\n- Recovery should take **twice as long as the drive**. This is your micro-rest.\n\n**Stroke Rate:** Target **24\u201328 strokes per minute**. Below 22 SPM you're leaving time on the table; above 32 SPM you're likely getting sloppy and wasting energy. Stronger/more powerful athletes can use a lower stroke rate with more power per stroke; more aerobic athletes may prefer 26\u201328 SPM (Rox Lyfe).\n\n**Damper Setting:** The damper is preset by division: Women = 5, Women Pro/Men = 6, Men Pro = 7. Athletes can adjust. **Optimal range is 4\u20136 for most athletes.** The damper controls airflow to the flywheel, not \"resistance\" in the traditional sense. Higher settings fatigue muscles faster without improving speed. Recommended drag factors: ~130\u2013135 for women, ~145 for men/women pro, ~165 for men pro (John Steventon via Rox Lyfe). Set your drag factor in training to match race conditions.\n\n### Pacing: Even Split vs. Negative Split\n\n**Negative split is the gold standard.** Start conservative, finish fast.\n\n| Strategy | 0\u2013250m | 250\u2013500m | 500\u2013750m | 750\u20131000m | Total |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Conservative (\"Recovery\") | 2:05\u20132:10 | 2:05\u20132:10 | 2:00\u20132:05 | 1:55\u20132:00 | ~4:00\u20134:15 |\n| Steady State (\"Time Saver\") | 1:55\u20132:00 | 1:50\u20131:55 | 1:50\u20131:55 | 1:45\u20131:50 | ~3:40\u20133:50 |\n| Aggressive (\"Send It\") | 1:45\u20131:50 | 1:42\u20131:47 | 1:42\u20131:47 | 1:40\u20131:45 | ~3:20\u20133:30 |\n\n*Pacing data from OnlyGains.ai.*\n\n**Rox Lyfe's wisdom:** Going 15\u201320 seconds slower than your absolute max 1000m row saves enormous energy and \"costs\" only seconds in context of a 75\u2013100 minute race\u2014but likely saves minutes on subsequent stations.\n\n**Hyrox-specific consideration:** Because your legs are heavily fatigued by Station 5 and you still need them for farmers carry, sandbag lunges, and wall balls, some athletes intentionally bias slightly more toward upper body pulling and less extreme leg drive than a pure rower would. This preserves quad/glute capacity for the race's second half (Rox Lyfe).\n\n### Common Mistakes\n\n1. **Pulling with arms first:** Loses the most powerful part of the stroke (legs). **Fix:** Cue \"Legs. Back. Arms.\" Say it out loud during training.\n2. **Damper too high:** Setting to 10 thinking it's harder = faster. **Fix:** Use 4\u20136. It's not a resistance dial.\n3. **Rushing the recovery:** Sliding forward at the same speed as the drive. **Fix:** 2:1 recovery-to-drive ratio. Slow slide forward, explosive drive back.\n4. **Hunching forward:** Rounds back at the catch, straining lower back. **Fix:** Chest proud, engage lats.\n5. **Death grip on handle:** Fries already-fatigued forearms. **Fix:** Loose hook grip\u2014fingers over handle, relaxed.\n6. **Pulling to chin:** Handle finishes at neck level. **Fix:** Handle to lower chest/upper stomach. Elbows pull back, not up.\n\n### Target Times by Performance Level\n\n| Level | 1000m Time (Isolated) | Pace/500m | In-Race Estimate |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Elite | Under 3:10 | Under 1:35 | 3:30\u20134:33 |\n| Advanced | 3:10\u20133:40 | 1:35\u20131:50 | 3:40\u20134:15 |\n| Intermediate | 3:40\u20134:15 | 1:50\u20132:07 | 4:15\u20135:00 |\n| Beginner | 4:15\u20135:00 | 2:07\u20132:30 | 5:00\u20136:00 |\n\n*HyroxDataLab elite: men 4:00\u20134:33, women 4:45\u20135:11. Average HYROX finisher: men ~6:30, women ~7:06 (competitive.fit). Rox Lyfe elite Pro median: men 3:58, women 4:29.*\n\n### Muscle Groups Taxed and Carryover to Next Run\n\n**Primary:** Quadriceps (leg drive), glutes (hip extension), latissimus dorsi (pull), hamstrings.\n**Secondary:** Biceps, forearms, core, erector spinae, calves.\n\n**Carryover to Run 6:** The row, when paced correctly, should **lower** your heart rate relative to the burpee broad jumps. Run 6 can actually feel relatively good if you used the row strategically. However, if you over-row, quads and grip will be compromised heading into the farmer's carry.\n\n### Training Drills\n\n- **Pacing Practice:** 4 \u00d7 500m, 2 min rest. Negative split each piece AND the overall set.\n- **Stroke Rate Cap:** 5 \u00d7 500m at 22 SPM cap. Forces leg drive efficiency.\n- **Race Simulation:** 1km run \u2192 80m BBJ \u2192 1km run \u2192 1000m row \u2192 1km run \u2192 200m farmer's carry.\n- **Endurance:** 3000m row, every 500m get off for 10 push-ups. Maintain consistent split despite interruptions (OnlyGains.ai).\n\n---\n\n## Station 6: Farmers Carry (200m)\n\nThe farmers carry is the most deceptive station in Hyrox. It looks simple\u2014pick up two kettlebells and walk 200 meters. But after six runs and five brutal stations, it becomes a test of grip endurance, postural integrity, and mental toughness. Weights: **Women Open 2\u00d716kg, Men Open/Women Pro 2\u00d724kg, Men Pro 2\u00d732kg.** You may put the kettlebells down without penalty, but every drop costs time.\n\n### Grip Strategies\n\n**Chalk:** Use it. It's permitted and makes a significant difference, especially if your hands are sweaty from previous stations.\n\n**Hook grip:** Some athletes use a hook-style grip (thumb wrapped under fingers) for added security. Test this in training\u2014it can be uncomfortable but reduces the chance of the kettlebell slipping.\n\n**Forearm endurance:** Grip is important but, according to Dr. Adam Storey (HYROX Sports Science Advisory Council member, via Rox Lyfe podcast), the farmer's carry is better classified as a **\"postural endurance test.\"** When athletes start failing, it's usually the upper back and shoulders that collapse first, not the hands. Once posture goes, grip fatigue accelerates because the kettlebells hang in a mechanically disadvantaged position.\n\n**Training grip specifically:** Dead hangs, heavy holds, farmer's carries at heavier-than-race weight over shorter distances (60\u201380m), and pull-ups all build grip capacity.\n\n### Walking Pace and Stride Length Optimization\n\n- **Walk as fast as possible.** Rox Lyfe's recommendation: complete this station as quickly as you possibly can. The longer you hold the kettlebells, the more they tax you. A 90-second carry is dramatically less fatiguing than a 3-minute carry\u2014it's not linear.\n- **Stride length:** Moderate, brisk strides\u2014not running, but aggressive walking. Overly long strides can create trunk sway that wastes energy.\n- **Posture:** Shoulders retracted, chest up, tall spine. Think \"military posture.\" The trap complex (upper/mid/lower traps) stabilizes the shoulders under load. If scapular control is lost and shoulders drift forward, the kettlebells feel heavier and grip fatigue accelerates (Dr. Adam Storey, Rox Lyfe podcast).\n\n### When to Set Down vs. Push Through\n\n- **Elite strategy:** Complete 200m unbroken. Period.\n- **Competitive strategy:** One planned rest at 100m if needed. Set down for no more than 5\u201310 seconds\u2014shake hands, reset grip, go.\n- **Recreational strategy:** Rest every 50\u201375m. Use the \"traffic light\" approach\u2014when grip feels like it's about to fail (yellow light), set down immediately BEFORE you drop them (red light). Picking up from a drop is harder than a planned set-down.\n- **Key insight:** Short, frequent rests beat pushing to failure and needing a long recovery. If you carry for 150m then drop with fried forearms, you might need 20\u201330 seconds to recover. Two brief 5-second pauses at 75m and 150m would have been faster overall.\n\n### Common Mistakes\n\n1. **Rushing and dropping:** Going too fast, losing grip, then needing extended recovery. **Fix:** Find a fast but sustainable pace with planned rest points.\n2. **Poor posture:** Shoulders rounded, upper back collapsed, trunk swaying. **Fix:** Retract shoulder blades, brace core, stand tall. Train upper back strength (barbell rows, shrugs, RDLs).\n3. **Death grip from the start:** Squeezing maximally from meter 1. **Fix:** Firm but not maximum grip\u2014gradually increase squeeze as fatigue builds.\n4. **Looking down:** Drops chest and encourages shoulder rounding. **Fix:** Eyes forward, chin level.\n\n### Target Times by Performance Level\n\n| Level | Men (2\u00d724kg / 2\u00d732kg Pro) | Women (2\u00d716kg / 2\u00d724kg Pro) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Elite | 1:10\u20131:45 | 1:20\u20132:00 |\n| Advanced | 1:45\u20132:10 | 2:00\u20132:15 |\n| Intermediate | 2:10\u20132:45 | 2:15\u20133:00 |\n| Beginner/Recreational | 2:45\u20134:00+ | 3:00\u20134:30+ |\n\n*Rox Lyfe targets: elite men ~1:10\u20131:30, elite women ~1:20\u20131:40, competitive age-groupers 1:30\u20132:30. Over 3 minutes = needs work. HyroxDataLab elite: men 1:45\u20131:59, women 2:00\u20132:15. Average HYROX finisher: men ~2:34, women ~2:49 (competitive.fit). Rox Lyfe elite Pro median: men 1:37, women 1:57.*\n\n### How Grip Fatigue Affects Remaining Stations\n\nThis is a critical strategic consideration. After the farmer's carry, you still face:\n- **Sandbag Lunges (Station 7):** Holding a 10\u201330kg sandbag on your shoulders. Dropping the sandbag incurs a **5-second penalty** on the first drop and **disqualification** on the second. Fatigued forearms/grip from the carry can make holding the sandbag brutal.\n- **Wall Balls (Station 8):** Holding and throwing a 4\u20139kg ball 100 times. Shoulder and forearm fatigue from the carry directly impacts wall ball performance.\n\n**Implication:** Don't over-grip the farmer's carry at the expense of the final two stations. Manage grip fatigue as a resource across Stations 6, 7, and 8.\n\n---\n\n## Station 7: Sandbag Lunges (100m)\n\nSandbag lunges are the seventh station and come brutally late in the race\u2014after 7km of running and six functional stations. Weights: **Women Open 10kg, Men Open/Women Pro 20kg, Men Pro 30kg.** The sandbag must remain on both shoulders at ALL times. Dropping the bag incurs a 5-second penalty; a second drop results in **disqualification.** This station shows one of the **highest time variabilities** of any station\u2014HyroxDataLab found 87\u201388 seconds of variance between athletes in the same finish-time bracket, making it a high-leverage training target.\n\n### Front-Loaded vs. Shoulder-Carry Position\n\nThe sandbag is positioned **across both shoulders** (a yoke-style carry). Key positioning:\n- **HIGH on traps, NOT low on shoulders.** Position the sandbag securely on the upper trapezius muscles, almost behind the neck.\n- Grip the bag firmly with both hands/forearms to prevent sliding.\n- Maintain a tall, upright torso. If your trunk collapses under the sandbag, every step costs more metabolically (Rox Lyfe).\n- Some athletes prefer a more \"front rack\" style hold\u2014sandbag resting on upper chest and anterior deltoids. This shifts load to the quads more but can be easier to manage the bag. Experiment in training.\n\nThe HyroxDataLab analysis recommends positioning the bag to enable a more **posterior chain\u2013dominant lunge** (longer steps, slight forward lean) rather than a quad-dominant pattern (short steps, very upright torso). This preserves quadriceps for wall balls.\n\n### Step Length and Tempo Optimization\n\n**The Sweet Spot: 0.9\u20131.1m steps (HyroxDataLab data analysis):**\n- **Men (targeting 1:30 finish):** 100\u2013110 total steps, step length 0.9\u20131.0m, expected time 4:30\u20135:30.\n- **Women (targeting 1:30 finish):** 110\u2013120 total steps, step length 0.85\u20130.95m, expected time 4:00\u20135:00.\n\n**Why not shorter steps?** Short steps (0.7m, ~140 total steps) are quad-dominant and destroy your quads before wall balls. HyroxDataLab found a **r = 0.738 correlation** between lunge technique and wall ball performance\u2014athletes who went quad-dominant on lunges averaged 75 seconds slower on wall balls.\n\n**Why not longer steps?** Excessively long steps (>1.2m) create balance issues, slow tempo, and increase injury risk on fatigued legs.\n\n**Tempo:** Aim for continuous \"touch-and-go\" lunges\u2014rear knee touches ground, immediately drive up into the next step. Avoid pausing in the standing position between reps. Set a metronome-like rhythm within the first 3 steps and maintain it.\n\n### Breathing Pattern During Lunges\n\n- **Inhale** as you lower into the lunge (eccentric phase).\n- **Exhale** as you drive up (concentric phase).\n- Alternatively, some athletes prefer exhaling at the bottom of the lunge to engage core bracing, then inhaling during the transition. Test both approaches in training.\n- The key is consistency\u2014irregular breathing under a loaded sandbag creates core instability and wastes energy.\n\n### Common Mistakes\n\n1. **Too-long steps:** Causes balance issues and slows tempo. **Fix:** Target 0.9\u20131.1m per step.\n2. **Losing balance / lateral drift:** Lunging offline wastes distance. **Fix:** Maintain a ~30cm foot-width between left and right feet (not lunging on a tightrope). Follow the centerline of the lane.\n3. **Poor posture / folding forward:** Trunk collapses under sandbag, increasing metabolic cost. **Fix:** Chest up, squeeze shoulder blades, strong upper back. Train front rack holds and Zercher carries.\n4. **Dropping the sandbag:** First drop = 5-second penalty. Second drop = DQ. **Fix:** Secure grip before starting; train holding the bag under fatigue. Forearm endurance from farmer's carry training pays dividends here.\n5. **Quad-dominant lunges (short steps, very upright):** Destroys quads before wall balls. **Fix:** Slightly longer steps with controlled forward lean to recruit glutes/hamstrings.\n6. **Resting between reps in standing position:** Standing pauses add up significantly over 100m. **Fix:** Touch-and-go rhythm\u2014knee touches, immediately drive into next step.\n\n### Target Times by Performance Level\n\n| Level | Men (20kg / 30kg Pro) | Women (10kg / 20kg Pro) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Elite | 3:00\u20134:00 | 3:30\u20134:30 |\n| Advanced | 4:00\u20134:45 | 4:00\u20134:30 |\n| Intermediate | 4:45\u20136:00 | 4:30\u20135:30 |\n| Beginner/Recreational | 6:00\u20138:00+ | 5:30\u20137:00+ |\n\n*HyroxDataLab elite: men 3:50\u20134:24, women 4:00\u20134:30.

Rox Lyfe Pro elite median: men 3:03, women 3:35.*\n\n### Quad and Glute Fatigue Management Heading into Wall Balls\n\nThe lunge-to-wall-ball connection is the most important inter-station relationship in the second half of Hyrox. HyroxDataLab's analysis found:\n- Athletes using **posterior chain\u2013dominant lunges** (longer steps, glute/hamstring emphasis) performed wall balls an average of **75 seconds faster** than athletes who used short, quad-dominant steps.\n- **Practical example:** Athlete A: 140 short steps (0.7m) \u2192 quad-dominant \u2192 wall balls at 7:30. Athlete B: 100 longer steps (1.0m) \u2192 posterior chain emphasis \u2192 wall balls at 6:15.\n\n**During Run 8 (after lunges, before wall balls):** Shake out quads during the run. Use dynamic muscle relaxation\u2014consciously relax quad muscles during each stride's swing phase. Mental prep: \"My quads are preserved. Wall balls will be hard but I'm ready.\"\n\n---\n\n## Station 8: Wall Balls (100 Reps \u2014 All Divisions)\n\nThe final station. The last obstacle between you and the finish line. 100 reps of wall balls\u2014a full-depth squat into an explosive overhead throw\u2014after 8km of running and 7 other functional stations. Weights: **Women Open 4kg to 9ft target (2.7m), Women Pro 6kg to 9ft, Men Open 6kg to 10ft target (3m), Men Pro 9kg to 10ft.** This station has one of the largest time variabilities (Rox Lyfe data shows a 3:13 gap between elite and average Pro men) and is where races are won or lost.\n\n### Optimal Technique\n\n**Setup:**\n- Stand facing the target with feet **shoulder-width apart** (or slightly wider for a stable base and deeper squat).\n- Position yourself approximately **one arm's length from the wall/rig**.\n- Hold the ball at chest height with elbows tucked. Thumbs behind/under the ball.\n- Eyes on the target to maintain upright posture.\n\n**The Squat:**\n- Initiate with a full-depth squat\u2014**hips must descend below knees** (below parallel). A box is placed behind you at most events; the judge checks that you make contact with it each rep. Shallow squats result in **no-reps**, which are devastating at this stage.\n- Drive up through heels, extending hips and knees explosively.\n- Maintain neutral spine throughout. Don't let the ball pull you forward.\n- Widen your stance if needed\u2014a wider stance allows for deeper squats with less ankle mobility demand.\n\n**The Throw:**\n- Use the **momentum from your squat drive** to power the throw. The ball should leave your hands as your legs reach full extension.\n- Some athletes add a slight **heel raise (calf raise) at the top** for extra power\u2014this is a personal preference that Rox Lyfe recommends testing in training.\n- Don't over-throw. Aim for the ball to **just** hit the target. Throwing excessively high wastes arm and shoulder energy.\n- Keep the ball **close to your body** throughout. Holding it away from your chest puts extra load on shoulders.\n\n**The Catch and Cycle:**\n- Catch the ball on its descent and **immediately begin squatting** as you absorb the ball. Don't catch with straight legs and then start squatting\u2014that's two separate movements instead of one.\n- This \"catch-and-squat\" technique dramatically improves efficiency and cycle time (George Edwards, HYROX coach).\n- If the ball falls, you must stand tall with hips and knees extended before starting the next rep\u2014you cannot catch a bounced ball and continue.\n\n### Break Strategy: What's Optimal by Fitness Level\n\nThis is one of the most common coaching queries: \"How should I break up wall balls?\"\n\n**Elite/Unbroken (Target: <5:30):**\n- 100 reps unbroken. Requires exceptional fitness and specific training. Only viable for athletes who can complete 100 unbroken reps in training under fatigue.\n\n**Competitive/Large Sets (Target: 5:30\u20137:00):**\n- Sets of 25\u201325\u201325\u201325 with 5\u201310 second rests. Or 30\u201330\u201320\u201320.\n- Rest is brief and **planned before failure**. Set the ball down, shake arms, 3\u20135 deep breaths, pick up and go.\n\n**Intermediate/Medium Sets (Target: 7:00\u20139:00):**\n- Sets of 15\u201320 with 10\u201315 second rests.\n- Centr (official Hyrox equipment provider) recommends: **25\u201315\u201310\u20135** descending pattern, staying sharp with form.\n- Alternative: Sets of 10 with very short rests (5 seconds). This keeps you moving and avoids the psychological challenge of staring down 25+ reps.\n\n**Beginner/Small Sets (Target: 9:00+):**\n- Sets of 10 with 15\u201320 second rests.\n- Or sets of 5 if needed\u2014just keep moving.\n- Key principle: **Don't go to failure.** If you can do 15 unbroken, break at 10. Failed reps (ball slipping, no-reps) cost far more time than planned rests.\n\n**Critical insight from Rox Lyfe:** \"Many people make the mistake of doing as many as they can at the start, but end up needing to take a lot of rest between sets after that initial blast. Instead, more frequent, but very quick rests, may help your overall time.\" Start conservatively and finish strong. With race adrenaline, you may find you can push through those final 20 reps without the planned rest.\n\n### Breathing Rhythm and Pacing\n\n- **Breathe in** at the bottom of the squat (this happens somewhat naturally).\n- **Breathe out** at the top of the rep as you release the ball.\n- One breath per rep is the target rhythm.\n- If doing large sets (25+), you may need to add a second breath cycle: inhale on the way down, exhale at the bottom, inhale on the way up, exhale on release. Find what works in training.\n\n**Cadence matters:** The speed at which you drop into the squat and drive back up (your \"cycle time\") makes an enormous difference over 100 reps. An elite athlete completing each rep in 3 seconds finishes in 5:00. A recreational athlete at 5 seconds per rep (plus rests) takes 9\u201310 minutes. Practice increasing cadence specifically.\n\n### Common Mistakes\n\n1. **Shallow squats (no-reps):** The single most devastating mistake. Each no-rep costs you the energy of the rep PLUS the rep doesn't count. **Fix:** Practice squat depth obsessively. Use the box touch cue. Go slightly deeper than required to build a margin.\n2. **Throwing too high:** Wastes arm and shoulder energy. **Fix:** Aim to just hit the target. Accuracy over power.\n3. **Ball too far from body:** Holding the ball away from your chest during the squat. **Fix:** Keep elbows tucked, ball at chest.\n4. **Catching with straight legs then squatting:** Two movements instead of one. **Fix:** Begin squatting as you catch\u2014absorb and descend simultaneously.\n5. **Taking too long between sets:** Long rests cool the muscles and make restarting harder. **Fix:** Planned, brief rests (5\u201310 seconds max). Set the ball down, shake arms, pick up.\n6. **Ego pacing:** Going for a big unbroken set to start and blowing up. **Fix:** Start with conservative sets and assess how you feel. You can always go bigger on the final set.\n\n### Target Times by Performance Level\n\n| Level | Men (6kg/9kg Pro, 10ft) | Women (4kg/6kg Pro, 9ft) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Elite | 4:25\u20135:30 | 3:50\u20135:20 |\n| Advanced | 5:30\u20136:30 | 5:20\u20136:00 |\n| Intermediate | 6:30\u20138:00 | 6:00\u20137:30 |\n| Beginner/Recreational | 8:00\u201310:00+ | 7:30\u201310:00+ |\n\n*HyroxDataLab elite: men 5:30\u20136:04, women 5:20\u20135:53. Average HYROX finisher: men ~7:08, women ~7:20 (competitive.fit). Rox Lyfe Pro elite median: men 4:25, women 3:50.*\n\n### Mentality and Finishing Strategies\n\n**This is the LAST station.** Everything you've saved, everything you've reserved\u2014spend it now.\n\n- **Empty the tank:** Rox Lyfe states: *\"By the time you reach the wall balls your tank will likely be almost empty, and you should use the wall balls to fully empty it!\"* There's nothing after this except the finish line sprint.\n- **Count down, not up:** Mentally, counting from 100 to 0 is more motivating than 0 to 100. \"Only 30 left\" hits different than \"I've done 70.\"\n- **Break it into micro-goals:** Don't think about 100. Think about the next 10. Then the next 10.\n- **Crowd energy:** The wall ball station is typically near the finish area and spectators can see you. Feed off that energy in the final 20\u201330 reps.\n- **The final kick:** From about 5 minutes before the finish (roughly the wall ball station for competitive athletes), go into full \"race kick\" mode. This is where the HYROX version of a \"finishing sprint\" happens\u2014on wall balls, not on the track.\n- **Visualization:** During the row (Station 5) or farmer's carry (Station 6), picture yourself completing your last wall ball rep. Build a mental image of crossing the finish line. This isn't woo-woo coaching; elite athletes consistently report using visualization to manage the final push.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table: All 8 Stations at a Glance\n\n| Station | Elite Time (M/F) | Competitive Time (M/F) | Recreational Time (M/F) | Key Muscle Groups | #1 Mistake |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **1.
