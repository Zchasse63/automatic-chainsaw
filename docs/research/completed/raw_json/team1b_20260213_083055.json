Pacing isn't about holding back\u2014it's about distributing effort optimally.\n\n\u2026\n\n**Example (1:45 goal):**\n\n- Runs 1-3: 5:45/km\n\n- Runs 4-6: 5:30/km\n\n- Runs 7-8: 5:15/km\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Lower risk of blowing up\n\n- Mentally satisfying (passing people late)\n\n- Easier to adjust mid-race\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Not the fastest possible time\n\n- Leaves potential on the table\n\n\u2026\n\n- All runs: 5:00-5:15/km\n\n- All stations: race-weight training time \u00b110%\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Maximizes efficiency\n\n- Optimal for most athletes\n\n- Predictable energy expenditure\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Requires discipline (fighting urge to sprint early)\n\n- Less room for error\n\nEven pacing is the gold standard for HYROX. Unless you're elite or a complete beginner, aim for this strategy.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Step 3: Adjust for Your Strengths/Weaknesses\n\n**The calculator gives you a baseline.** Now personalize it:\n\n**If you're a strong runner:**\n\n- Subtract 10-15 seconds from each run split\n\n- Add 15-20 seconds to your weakest 2 stations\n\n**If you're strong at stations:**\n\n- Subtract 15-30 seconds from your fastest 2 stations\n\n- Add 15-20 seconds to run splits\n\n## Breaking Down a 1:30:00 Goal Time\n\n|Segment|Target|Cumulative|Notes|\n|--|--|--|--|\n|Run 1|5:15|5:15|Start controlled|\n|SkiErg|4:30|9:45|Smooth, 70-80%|\n|RoxZone|1:05|10:50|Jog to next run|\n|Run 2|5:20|16:10|Find rhythm|\n|Sled Push (152kg/102kg)|3:30|19:40|Low, fast feet|\n|RoxZone|1:05|20:45|Quick reset|\n|Run 3|5:25|26:10|Slight slowdown OK|\n\n\u2026\n\n|Lunges (20kg/10kg)|5:30|1:15:25|Small steps|\n|RoxZone|1:05|1:16:30|Final push|\n|Run 8|5:40|1:22:10|Last run|\n|Wall Balls (100)|6:30|1:28:40|Unbroken sets|",

Poor pacing in the runs\n\n**Why it\u2019s a problem:** The temptation to hammer the first run is strong (especially when adrenaline is high), but HYROX rewards steady effort, not hero splits.

So why race HYROX without one?\n\n**The problem:** Most athletes show up with a vague goal (\"go sub-1:30\") but no concrete plan for how to get there. They go out too fast, blow up on stations 3-4, and limp through the final wall balls\u2014wondering what went wrong.\n\n**The solution:** A data-driven pacing strategy that breaks your goal time into achievable splits for each segment.\n\nThis guide teaches you\n\n**how to build a smart pacing plan** using our Pacing Calculator\u2014and more importantly, **how to execute it on race day.**\n\n#### Key Takeaway\n\nAthletes who pace evenly (within 10% variance across runs) finish 5-10% faster than those who sprint early and fade late. Pacing isn't about holding back\u2014it's about distributing effort optimally.\n\n## Why Pacing Matters in HYROX\n\nHYROX is unique: it's\n\n**8km of running + 8 stations** done back-to-back with minimal rest.\n\n**The pacing challenge:**\n\n- Start too fast \u2192 blow up by station 4\n\n- Start too slow \u2192 leave time on the table\n\n- Uneven effort \u2192 waste energy on recovery\n\n**The data shows:**\n\nAthletes who pace strategically finish significantly faster than those who \"wing it.\"\n\n## The 3 Core Pacing Strategies\n\nThere are three main approaches to HYROX pacing. Your choice depends on your fitness level and goals.\n\n### Strategy 1: Negative Split (Beginner-Friendly)\n\n**What it means:**\n\nStart conservative, finish strong. Early runs are slower than late runs.\n\n**Who it's for:**\n\n- First-time racers\n\n- Athletes unsure of their fitness\n\n- Anyone prioritizing \"finish strong\" over \"optimal time\"\n\n**Example (1:45 goal):**\n\n- Runs 1-3: 5:45/km\n\n- Runs 4-6: 5:30/km\n\n- Runs 7-8: 5:15/km\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Lower risk of blowing up\n\n- Mentally satisfying (passing people late)\n\n- Easier to adjust mid-race\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Not the fastest possible time\n\n- Leaves potential on the table\n\n### Strategy 2: Even Pacing (The Sweet Spot)\n\n**What it means:**\n\nConsistent effort across all runs and stations. Minimal variance.\n\n**Who it's for:**\n\n- Experienced athletes\n\n- Those targeting a specific time\n\n- Athletes with strong fitness and mental discipline\n\n**Example (1:30 goal):**\n\n- All runs: 5:00-5:15/km\n\n- All stations: race-weight training time \u00b110%\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Maximizes efficiency\n\n- Optimal for most athletes\n\n- Predictable energy expenditure\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Requires discipline (fighting urge to sprint early)\n\n- Less room for error\n\nEven pacing is the gold standard for HYROX. Unless you're elite or a complete beginner, aim for this strategy.\n\n### Strategy 3: Controlled Fast Start (Advanced Only)\n\n**What it means:**\n\nRun the first 3-4 runs slightly faster than target, then hold on.\n\n**Who it's for:**\n\n- Elite athletes (sub-1:15 men, sub-1:24 women)\n\n- Strong runners with excellent fitness\n\n- Competitive racers targeting podiums\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Builds early time cushion\n\n- Works if you're strong at running but weaker at stations\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- High risk of blowing up\n\n- One bad station = race falls apart\n\n**Our recommendation:** Unless you're elite, stick with **Strategy 2 (Even Pacing).**\n\n## How to Use the HyroxDataLab Pacing Calculator\n\nOur Pacing Calculator does the math for you.\n\n### Step 1: Input Your Goal Time\n\nExample:\n\n**1:35:00**\n\n**How to set a realistic goal:**\n\n- First race: Add 10-15% to training simulations\n\n- Returning racer: Aim for 5-10% improvement\n\n- Use our benchmark guide for reference\n\n### Step 2: Review Your Target Splits\n\nThe calculator outputs:\n\n**Run Paces:**Each 1km run target (accounting for fatigue) **Station Times:**Expected times for all 8 stations **RoxZone Budget:**Transition time (aim for 1:00-1:30 per transition)\n\n### Step 3: Adjust for Your Strengths/Weaknesses\n\n**The calculator gives you a baseline.** Now personalize it:\n\n**If you're a strong runner:**\n\n- Subtract 10-15 seconds from each run split\n\n- Add 15-20 seconds to your weakest 2 stations\n\n**If you're strong at stations:**\n\n- Subtract 15-30 seconds from your fastest 2 stations\n\n- Add 15-20 seconds to run splits\n\n## Breaking Down a 1:30:00 Goal Time\n\n|Segment|Target|Cumulative|Notes|\n|--|--|--|--|\n|Run 1|5:15|5:15|Start controlled|\n|SkiErg|4:30|9:45|Smooth, 70-80%|\n|RoxZone|1:05|10:50|Jog to next run|\n|Run 2|5:20|16:10|Find rhythm|\n|Sled Push (152kg/102kg)|3:30|19:40|Low, fast feet|\n|RoxZone|1:05|20:45|Quick reset|\n|Run 3|5:25|26:10|Slight slowdown OK|\n|Sled Pull (103kg/78kg)|4:00|30:10|Steady pulls|\n|RoxZone|1:05|31:15|Mental check|\n|Run 4|5:25|36:40|Halfway point|\n|Burpees (80m)|6:00|42:40|Sets of 10|\n|RoxZone|1:05|43:45|Stay moving|\n|Run 5|5:30|49:15|The grind|\n|Row (1000m)|4:45|54:00|Legs + pull|\n|RoxZone|1:05|55:05|3 left|\n|Run 6|5:35|1:00:40|Maintain|\n|Farmers (48kg/32kg)|2:30|1:03:10|Don't drop|\n|RoxZone|1:05|1:04:15|Almost there|\n|Run 7|5:40|1:09:55|2 stations|\n|Lunges (20kg/10kg)|5:30|1:15:25|Small steps|\n|RoxZone|1:05|1:16:30|Final push|\n|Run 8|5:40|1:22:10|Last run|\n|Wall Balls (100)|6:30|1:28:40|Unbroken sets|\n|RoxZone|1:20|1:30:00|Sprint finish|\n|Finish|\u2014|1:30:00|Done!|\n**RoxZone** includes running from finish line \u2192 station \u2192 next run start.

Here's how to adapt:\n\n### If You're Ahead of Schedule\n\n**Don't celebrate yet.** Being 2 minutes ahead after 3 stations often means you started too fast.\n\n**What to do:**\n\n- Check effort level: Breathing heavily? Legs burning?\n\n- Assess remaining stations: Weakest ones still ahead?\n\n**Decision:**If you feel great, maintain (don't speed up). If working hard, slow 5-10%.\n\nBetter to finish 1 minute ahead than blow up and finish 3 minutes behind your goal.\n\n### If You're Behind Schedule\n\n**Don't panic.** Being 2 minutes behind after 3 stations is recoverable.\n\n**What to do:**\n\n- Identify the problem: Which stations/runs were slow?\n\n- Adjust realistically: Don't try to \"make up 2 minutes\" in one station\n\n**Recovery Strategy:**\n\n- Save 15-20 sec on each remaining run (if possible)\n\n- Shave 10-15 sec off RoxZone transitions\n\n- Go harder on your strongest remaining station\n\n## Common Pacing Mistakes (& How to Avoid)\n\n### Mistake #1: \"I'll Just Go Hard and See What Happens\"\n\n**Why it fails:**\n\nYou blow up by station 4, suffer through 5-8, finish 5-10 minutes slower than potential.\n\n**Fix:**\n\nBuild a plan. Even a rough plan beats no plan.\n\n### Mistake #2: Ignoring Fatigue Accumulation\n\n**Why it fails:**\n\nYou pace run 1 perfectly but don't account for cumulative fatigue. By run 7, you're 30 sec/km slower.\n\n**Fix:**\n\nBuild fatigue into your plan. Expect runs 5-8 to be 10-20 sec/km slower than runs 1-2.\n\n### Mistake #3: Racing on Feeling, Not Data\n\n**Why it fails:**\n\nAdrenaline makes run 1 feel \"easy,\" so you go 30 seconds too fast. By run 4, you're cooked.\n\n**Fix:**\n\nWear a GPS watch. Check pace every 500m. Trust data > feelings.\n\n### Mistake #4: Not Practicing Your Pace\n\n**Why it fails:**\n\nYou've never run 5:15/km pace under fatigue. On race day, you don't know what it feels like.\n\n**Fix:**\n\nDo\n\n**race-pace simulations** in training.\n\n## Sample Pacing Plans by Goal Time\n\n### 2:00:00 Goal (Beginner)\n\n|Segment|Target|\n|--|--|\n|Runs (avg)|6:30/km|\n|SkiErg|6:00|\n|Sled Push (152kg/102kg)|5:00|\n|Sled Pull (103kg/78kg)|6:00|\n|Burpees|9:00|\n|Row|6:00|\n|Farmers (48kg/32kg)|4:00|\n|Lunges (20kg/10kg)|8:00|\n|Wall Balls|8:00|\n|RoxZone|11:00|\n### 1:30:00 Goal (Intermediate)\n\n|Segment|Target|\n|--|--|\n|Runs (avg)|5:25/km|\n|SkiErg|4:30|\n|Sled Push (152kg/102kg)|3:30|\n|Sled Pull (103kg/78kg)|4:00|\n|Burpees|6:00|\n|Row|4:45|\n|Farmers (48kg/32kg)|2:30|\n|Lunges (20kg/10kg)|5:30|\n|Wall Balls|6:30|\n|RoxZone|9:00|\n### 1:10:00 Goal (Elite)\n\n|Segment|Target|\n|--|--|\n|Runs (avg)|4:30/km|\n|SkiErg|3:50|\n|Sled Push (152kg/102kg)|2:30|\n|Sled Pull (103kg/78kg)|3:00|\n|Burpees|4:30|\n|Row|3:50|\n|Farmers (48kg/32kg)|1:55|\n|Lunges (20kg/10kg)|4:15|\n|Wall Balls|4:30|\n|RoxZone|5:00|\n## Your Race Day Pacing Checklist\n\n**1 Week Before:**\n\n- Finalize goal time based on training\n\n- Build pacing plan (use calculator)\n\n- Write splits on your arm or wrist band\n\n**Race Morning:**\n\n- Set lap alerts on GPS watch (every 1km)\n\n- Warm up with pace checks (200m at goal pace)\n\n- Visualize first 3 stations (commit to plan)\n\n**During Race:**\n\n- Check watch every 500m (stay on pace)\n\n- Mental checkpoints: \"How do I feel?

          "snippet": "Understanding the best way to approach the running sections of a HYROX race is not easy. HYROX is very different to pacing something such a normal 5km / 10km running race, for example. In those you are only running, and will likely have a reasonably good idea of how fast you can go from your training sessions. But in a HYROX you have all the functional exercises in-between the runs. This can have a significant impact on your running capabilities.\n\nGo too quick with your runs, and you\u2019ll end up making it harder than it needs to be, suffering later on, and potentially having to walk aspects of the race. Go too slow, and your overall time will suffer (as running is approximately 50% of the race). Getting your pace just right is, therefore, critical.\n\nIn this article, I\u2019ll take you through what I\u2019ve learned about pacing a HYROX, from personal experience, helping our coaching clients, and from diving into the data.\n\n**Keep It Consistent**\n\nIn our \u201cAverage to Elite\u201d article, we highlighted that the best performers in HYROX appeared to pace their runs more consistently than those who achieved an average HYROX time (which is about 90mins). This was particularly the case for the men. That perhaps shouldn\u2019t be a surprise as a study has shown that women were 18.33% better than men at keeping an even pace in a marathon.\n\nOne thing to appreciate in HYROX is that the 1st run, and the last run, in some instances, can be different in length to the other 6 runs. With the first run you need to take into account that the \u201cStart\u201d is in a slightly different place to the \u201cOut\u201d of the Roxzone. This makes the first run shorter, or longer, than subsequent runs. What\u2019s more, the final run is often longer because you need to make it to the Wall Ball station. That can be a reasonably long journey at most HYROX venues. I\u2019d previously assumed this \u2018journey\u2019 was added on to your Roxzone time, as opposed to your run time, but that\u2019s not the case \u2013 it goes on to your run time.\n\nTherefore, when all is considered, it\u2019s really only appropriate to assess runs 2-7 for consistency of pacing.\n\n**2022 HYROX World Championships Running Pace**\n\nUnderstanding this, I decided to take another look at the data. This time I used the 2022 HYROX World Championships in Las Vegas as the starting point.\n\nI took the median run times for the following 3 groups of HYROX athletes:\n\n\u2013 the top 5 Elite race finishers\n\n\u2013 the remainder of the Elite race finishers\n\n\u2013 a sample of athletes competing in the Pro division, on the same day, who achieved around the average finisher time (approximately 85mins)\n\nI then looked at the average differences, for the athletes in these groups, between their fastest 1km run and their slowest 1km run (for runs 2 to 7 only).\n\nHere\u2019s what the graph showed\u2026\n\n**We can see that the top 5 finishers in the Elite race ran much more consistent time splits, on average, than the remainder of the Elite racers. And the average Pro competitors ran much less consistent splits than the Elite racers.**\n\n**Going Out Hot?**\n\nSo that\u2019s runs 2 to 7 analysed. But how about the first run? Anyone who has taken part in a HYROX will know how tempting it is to go out quickly from the start, spurred on by the adrenaline of the race, as well as the fact that everyone else around you seems to also be starting quickly!\n\nIn Las Vegas, the first run was substantially shorter than subsequent runs. So, I looked to see if we could work out if going out too fast was affecting someone\u2019s overall time\u2026\n\nThe graph shows the top 5 Elite finishers spent a\n\n**longer** amount of time on their first run than the rest of the Elite field, relative to their average overall run time. Basically, **they went out a touch slower, relative to their overall running split times, than the rest of the Elites, who in turn went out slower than the average Pro athletes.** Put another way, the athletes with the slower overall times, seem to be going out relatively faster on the first run.\n\n*I should just quickly add here that I am only looking at the World Championships data here. All of the athletes at the World Championships are amazing. They have earned the right to be there and are very good, and likely experienced, at HYROX. This data simply shows that the best of the best appeared to pace their runs more consistently, and went out relatively slower on the first run. My guess is that an average athlete at a non-World Championship event would show an even greater amount of variability in their runs, and would likely go out much faster on their first run. *\n\n**But is it Important?**\n\nIt seems to be reasonably clear, at the HYROX World Championships at least, the fastest competitors paced their runs more consistently than the rest of the field. And they don\u2019t go out as quick (relatively speaking) on the first run either. Of course, we can\u2019t know with any certainty whether that is playing a part in their superior finishing position. However, we can look elsewhere for some clues\u2026\n\n**Kipchoge 2 Hour Marathon**\n\nWhere better to start than one of the greatest running performances of all time? On 12th October 2019, 34-year-old Eliud Kipchoge ran a marathon in under 2 hours. His time of 1:59:40, was set in Vienna and is the fastest any runner has ever covered 26.2 miles. The event had been specifically put on with this goal in mind, and no stone was left unturned in helping to facilitate the incredible feat. As part of that, Kipchoge ran behind a group of pacemakers, and a pace setting car, throughout the race. This meant that every single 1km split time for the whole marathon was between 2:48ins/km and 2:52mins/km. It feels reasonably safe to say if such consistent pacing was not optimal, then Kipchoge and his team would not have gone to such great lengths to achieve it.\n\n**Half Marathon World Record**\n\nBut a marathon is, roughly speaking, twice the length of time of the HYROX world record. Maybe pacing a marathon is more important because it\u2019s longer?\n\nSo, let\u2019s look at the half-marathon world records. At the time of writing, the men\u2019s half marathon WR is held by Uganda\u2019s Jacob Kiplimo, with a time of 57:31. This is much more aligned with a HYROX elite athlete race time.\n\nI don\u2019t have the precise 1km split times for his whole race. However, we can see that for the first 5km he averaged 2:44mins/km, for the next 5km he averaged 2:41mins/km, the next 5km was 2:40mins/km, and the remainder of the race he averaged 2:48mins/km. Not quite as consistent as Kipchoge\u2019s marathon but still incredibly consistent.\n\nThe women\u2019s half marathon WR is held by Ethiopia\u2019s Letesenbet Gidey with a time of 1:02:52. For the first 5km she averaged 3:00mins/km, for the next 5km she averaged 2:57mins/km, the next 5km was 2:57mins/km, and the remainder of the race she averaged 3:01mins/km. Again, very consistent!\n\n**Why is Pacing so Important?**\n\nIf it is the case that consistent pacing is important, and that does appear to be the case, why is that?\n\nThe fact is that if you go out too fast you will more quickly build up lactic acid in the body, use up glycogen stores much sooner, and increase your core temperature too soon.\n\nOver shorter distances / race times, this can be manageable (within reason). But when you are talking about something as long as a HYROX it just makes the latter stages of the race too hard, and you slow too much.\n\nEssentially, you want to just push to the point where you aren\u2019t excessively fatiguing yourself for the latter stages of the race. It\u2019s a difficult thing to manage \u2013 and it comes with training sessions designed with that purpose in mind, as well as experience of the HYROX events themselves.\n\nConsistent pacing will almost certainly mean deliberately slowing yourself towards the start of the race. You will likely feel like you could be going faster (and many athletes around you\n\n*will* be going faster). This can be mentally challenging. However, it is better to slow yourself down deliberately at the start, than be forced to slow down towards the end (or sooner!)\n\n**How Can I Pace Myself at HYROX?**\n\nWithout practice, research has shown that recreational runners incorrectly estimate their pace by 32 to 40 seconds per mile. Accurate, consistent pacing isn\u2019t something you want to leave to chance on race day! Fortunately, there are steps you can take to help \u2026\n\n**Use Your Watch**\n\nThe most effective way I\u2019ve found to pace myself at HYROX is by using the lap functionality on my watch. As I leave the Roxzone, I hit the lap timer button. I then keep a close eye on my time so that I enter the Roxzone again at a\n\n**pre-determined** running split time. This also helps to minimise the chances of the surprisingly common mistake of running too many (or too few) laps of the track.\n\nI\u2019ll also know how my target time translates to the amount of time I need to run\n\n**per lap** of the track. I use the venue floor plan to help do this in the days prior to the race. Let\u2019s say that 1km is 2.5 laps of the track. If I want to hit a running split of 4:30mins/km, it means I need to run 1 lap of the track in about 1:48mins. So, from the moment I leave the Roxzone, to the first time I pass the Roxzone exit, I\u2019ll be aiming to do it in roughly 1:48mins. This is something I will be keeping an eye on during my runs.\n\nThe watch I personally use is the Polar Vantage M2, but many watches will have a lap functionality that would be suitable.\n\n**First Run**\n\nYou also need to consider that the first run can be shorter, or longer, depending on where the Start line is. I will calculate, in advance, how long I want that first run to take. If I estimate the first run to be 100meters shorter, for example, then I\u2019d be looking for my first run to be 90% of my normal running split times. If my 1km time aim is 4:30mins, then that first run at 90%, would be 4:03mins.\n\n**Practice in Training**\n\nI appreciate I am a bit of a numbers geek. Some of this stuff (like working out time per lap, etc) may come more naturally to me than others. I do, though, think it\u2019s a very important, and highly underappreciated, aspect to HYROX. Therefore, it is something that should be practiced in your training sessions. You could literally run some 1km intervals at race pace (perhaps at the athletics track), both with the use of your watch and its lap timing functionality, and on occasions without a watch (in an attempt to get used to proper pacing by feel alone).\n\n**How Do I Know What Pace to Go Though?!**\n\nDetermining your appropriate race pace can largely come down to experience. If you\u2019ve competed in HYROX before you\u2019ll know your total running time. That can be used as a starting point for working out how fast you want to run next time (taking into account any improvements you\u2019ve made since then). Everyone is different so it\u2019s hard for me to give any specific direction as to how fast you should be running. But I\u2019ll try\u2026\n\n**Running Race Paces**\n\nFirstly, if you haven\u2019t done a HYROX before, I wouldn\u2019t expect your 1km running splits to be aligned with your 5km pace. It will almost certainly be slower than that. It will also likely be slower than your 10km running pace. I\u2019m sure there are people who do run at their 10km pace, but in my experience that\u2019s not common. It will likely be more aligned with your half marathon, or even marathon, pace. I know that\u2019s not hugely prescriptive but hopefully it gives you a ballpark pace to be thinking about. If you\u2019ve not run a half or full marathon before, then this race time predictor can provide a rough estimate of your time based on any shorter runs that you\u2019ve done. Again, its rough, but gives a bit of a guide to be thinking about.\n\n**How Long Does it Take to Run 1km?**\n\nHow long it takes to run 1km, on average, is of course a question that many people entering HYROX for the first time will have. The reality is, it depends on a huge number of factors. The fastest in HYROX will run 1km as quick as 3:30m, sometimes even faster. The average though are slower than that. In the Mens Open (generally the most well attended division), the average time per km is just over 5 minutes.\n\n**Heart Rate Test**\n\nOne test I periodically perform to help determine my pace is to run 1km at 155bpm (which is around 85% of my max heart rate).\n\nTo do this I will start to run (on an athletics track) and steadily bring my heart rate up to that level. Then I\u2019ll hit the start timer on my watch, and time how long it takes me to run 1km whilst maintaining my heart rate at an average of 155bpm. You may need to adjust your HR target depending on your age, max heart rate, and how comfortable you feel over extended periods of time at certain heart rates. I have found that the time I take to do this is, roughly speaking, a good pace for me to aim for at HYROX.\n\nIt certainly might not be appropriate for everyone, but it\u2019s good for me. It\u2019s also a reasonably pure way of tracking your running progress as it takes out any pacing experience, trying harder, or anything like that \u2013 it\u2019s all just driven by your heart rate. That said, there are obviously factors that can affect the result such as levels of fatigue, the temperature, etc. So I consider it a rough guide. I ensure I use my\n\n**heart rate strap** for this test as it provides a much great level of accuracy than a heart rate watch does.\n\n**Training Practice**\n\nAside from the above, the best way to determine an appropriate pace is by experimenting in training. This is where a full HYROX run through / simulation can come in handy. To find out what might be considered a good running pace in HYROX check out this article.\n\n**Summary**\n\nBetween my first HYROX and my third, I improved my time by 12 minutes. I attribute a fair portion of the improvement to more appropriately pacing my race. I think it\u2019s a hugely underappreciated aspect to HYROX that can have a real impact on your overall performance. It\u2019s not necessarily an easy thing to do, which is why it\u2019s important to work on in your training sessions.\n\nIf you need more help with all of this, as well as training for the event, and planning your nutrition, check out our coaching plans, where we give you all the tools you need to maximise your potential in HYROX.\n\n",

          "snippet": "While HYROX is a relatively straightforward event, even experienced athletes can make mistakes which cost them time and energy.\n\nHere\u2019s some of the main ones to avoid in your next HYROX\u2026\n\n**1. Starting Out Too Quickly**\n\nIt is crucial to pace yourself during a HYROX event. It\u2019s very easy to start out much quicker than you ideally should \u2013 especially with all the excitement of the day. However, that can mean you make the latter stages of the race very hard for yourself.\n\nI now purposely hold myself back a bit on the first few runs so not to exhaust myself too early. As well as the runs, the Ski and Sled Push are stations where some pacing often makes sense. However, they are also stations that athletes typically try to do as quickly as they can. Slowing down a few seconds on these often pays dividends later in the race.\n\nClick here to find out more about how to improve your performance on the HYROX Sled Push, and this article that takes about how to pace your running at HYROX.\n\n**2. Not Training Compromised Running**\n\nThe running during a HYROX event can feel much harder (and slower) than running a similar distance in isolation. The difference between running 1km on fresh legs, and running 1km after 100 meters of lunges, for example, is significant. Training this type of \u201ccompromised running\u201d, so that it\u2019s less of a shock during the race, is important.\n\nTo read more on compromised running, and how to train for it, check out this article.\n\n**3. Not Tapering Training**\n\nWhen I look on Instagram and see the amount of training certain competitors are still putting in during the week before a HYROX event, it always astounds me. I don\u2019t think we should believe everything we see on Instagram, of course. However, suffice to say, for the majority of people, tapering down your training in the 1-2 weeks prior to the race is usually a great idea if you want to feel fresh during the race.\n\nWe talk more about the important of a taper, and how to do it, as well as some of the main considerations, in this article on \u201cHow to Taper Training for a HYROX\u201d.\n\n**4. Incorrect Laps**\n\nOne mistake made surprisingly often is for a competitor to run too many, or too few, laps of the arena. It varies by venue, but typically you need to run 2-4 laps of the circuit to cover the 1km distance. However, when you\u2019re deep into the race, fatigued, it\u2019s easy to lose count. Too many laps and you cost yourself time and energy. Too few laps and you\u2019ll get a time penalty.\n\nAs well as (obviously) counting the laps in your head, you can, and should, try to use the screen in the venue which tells you what lap you\u2019re on. That\u2019s not always easy to see though, so for additional tips on avoiding this problem refer to our running pace article where I discuss how I use my watch to time my laps.\n\n**5. CrossFit Shoes**\n\nChoosing the most appropriate footwear for HYROX is critical. One mistake many beginners to the sport make is to wear CrossFit type shoes \u2013 such as Nike Metcons or Reebok Nanos \u2013 for the race. They would, in general, be great for the functional exercises, but a huge portion of the race is running, and they simply aren\u2019t as good as most traditional running shoes for that job.\n\nTo read up more on the best footwear for HYROX, check out the linked article.\n\n**6. Not Testing Footwear**\n\nNo matter what shoe you select, you should test it out beforehand, especially on a sled push. There are 2 potential issues that could happen here. One is that a lack of grip on the underside of the shoe could mean that your feet slip when you push the sled. Another is your heel can slip out the back of the shoe, again when pushing the sled. This last issue can often (but not always) be resolved by using \u201cHeel Lock Lacing\u201d.\n\n**7. Slowing in Roxzone**\n\nWe\u2019ve spoken about this plenty on the site (in this article, and this article, for example), but one mistake athletes often make, especially when they are new to HYROX, is they slow down quite considerably in Roxzone (if you aren\u2019t sure what the Roxzone is, watch this video).\n\nAwareness of this is the first step. It\u2019s easy to subconsciously slow down as you enter the zone. I\u2019ve done it myself in the past. But it\u2019s not necessary.\n\nOne reason people spend a lot of time in the Roxzone is because it\u2019s where you can get a drink of water. While this may be necessary to some extent, hydrate well before the race to minimise the amount you need during the race.\n\nIt\u2019s also sometimes possible for people to get a little lost in the Roxzone, and not know the direction they need to be heading for the next stage of the race. To help avoid this issue, familiarise yourself with the layout prior to the race starting. You\u2019ll be sent the floor plan as part of the Athlete\u2019s Guide and technical briefing video in the few days prior to the event to help with this.\n\n**8. Forgetting to Chalk Hands**\n\nChalk is primarily helpful on the sled pull and the farmers carries at HYROX as it provides some added grip. This can be very much needed during a hot, sweaty race.\n\nHowever, when you just want to get on with things as quickly as possible, chalking your hands is an easy thing to forget. It is time well invested though. If you lose your grip on the farmers carries, for example, and need to repeatedly stop to put the kettlebells down as a result, that will eat into your time.\n\n**9. No Reps / Not Knowing Movement Standards**\n\nMaking sure you follow the movement standards described in the HYROX rulebook is very important. If your technique is not where it needs to be, and the judge observing you gives you some \u201cno reps\u201d, this is valuable time that will be added to your finishing time.\n\nThis is especially common on the burpee broad jumps and wall balls, in particular. Ensure you have familiarised yourself with the movement standards on these well in advance, and practiced adhering to them in your training sessions.\n\n**10. Stations in Wrong Order**\n\nAthletes have sometimes been known to complete the functional stations in the wrong order. Doing so results in a time penalty. This is a surprisingly simple mistake to make when you are extremely fatigued in the midst of a race. Again, using the screen at the venue can help here as it tells you where you need to head next. Do also try to ensure you have the correct order very well memorised in your head before starting (check our Beginner\u2019s Guide to HYROX if need be).\n\n**11. Last Minute Panic**\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to think about before a race (checking in your bag, putting timing chip round ankle, going to the toilet at the right time, moving your way around a busy venue, etc). This can often lead to panic. Spiking your heart rate because you\u2019re stressed, before the race has even started, is not good prep for a good performance. In this \u201cPre HYROX Race Routine\u201d article we talk some more about planning the time before a race so start it in a good mental state.\n\n**12. HYROX Simulations**\n\nThe standardisation of a HYROX event can lead many athletes to perform numerous HYROX simulations (or scaled versions of one) in their training. There\u2019s nothing wrong with doing that occasionally but doing them too often may not be the best approach. A full HYROX can be extremely tiring and take a fair few days (for most people) to recover from. Do too many, too often, and you\u2019ll risk injury.\n\nIt\u2019s probably also not optimal from a training perspective. For example, just doing 1 set of 100m lunges each week likely isn\u2019t the best way to improve your 100m lunge time. Splitting up the total you do into more manageable sets, perhaps with heavier weights, and progressively overloading over time, can often be more effective, as well as being easier to recover from.\n\nTo reiterate, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a bad idea to occasionally replicate a HYROX race in your training; I would just be careful of making the mistake of doing it too often. If you do need help with training for the event, check out our personalised coaching options, or our 12 Week Training Plan.\n\n**13. Changing Your Diet**\n\nYou\u2019ve heard about the need for more carbs (for energy) and decide a pre-race pasta party might be in order? Or a supplement company convinced you to buy a box of energy gels which you plan to chug down minutes before the race? Be careful. Dramatically changing what you eat in the days and hours before a race can be a big, all too common mistake. To be clear, I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s something wrong with increased carb intake, or energy gels or anything like that. But don\u2019t leave it until just before the race to find out how you respond to those. Instead, it\u2019s something you should be testing well in advance. For example, energy gels can cause digestive distress for some people. Do you really want to find you\u2019re one of those people mid-HYROX? Probably not, and I\u2019m guessing the other athletes around you don\u2019t either!\n\nHopefully these tips will help you avoid any mistakes for your next HYROX.\n\n",

          "snippet": "Pacing is the difference between a strong finish and hitting the wall in HYROX. While fitness provides the foundation, intelligent pacing strategy determines whether you'll maintain performance across all eight stations or fade in the crucial final segments.\n\nElite athletes understand that HYROX success isn't about going fast\u2014it's about going smart. At the 2022 World Championships, top finishers demonstrated remarkable consistency, with only a 6-second difference between their fastest and slowest 1km runs. This level of control doesn't happen by accident.\n\nThese five proven pacing strategies will help you master your energy distribution, maintain performance across all stations, and finish stronger than ever before.\n\n## Understanding HYROX Pacing Fundamentals\n\n### Why Pacing Matters in HYROX\n\nHYROX demands a unique approach to energy management that differs fundamentally from single-modal endurance sports:\n\n**Multi-Modal Demands:** **8km total running**requires sustained aerobic capacity **8 functional stations**demand anaerobic power and strength **Rapid transitions**between different movement patterns **45-90 minute duration**with minimal recovery opportunities\n\n**Energy System Challenges:** **Aerobic System**: Powers the running segments and recovery **Anaerobic System**: Fuels the high-intensity station work **Neuromuscular System**: Maintains coordination under fatigue **Mental Focus**: Sustains decision-making throughout\n\n**Common Pacing Mistakes:** **Starting too aggressively**and paying later **Inconsistent running splits**creating unnecessary fatigue **Poor station energy management**leading to dramatic slowdowns **Ignoring transition efficiency**and losing precious seconds\n\nPerformance Insight: Athletes with consistent pacing perform significantly better. Elite competitors maintain splits within a 5-second range across all running segments.\n\n## Tip 1: Maintain Steady Running Pace\n\nRunning accounts for approximately 50% of your total HYROX race time, making it the foundation of successful pacing strategy. The goal is finding a sustainable rhythm that conserves energy for station work while maintaining competitive speed.\n\n### The Science of Consistent Running\n\n**Physiological Benefits:** **Reduced lactate accumulation**from avoiding pace surges **Stable heart rate zones**maintaining aerobic efficiency **Preserved glycogen stores**for station demands **Consistent oxygen consumption**avoiding metabolic stress\n\n**Mental Advantages:** **Cognitive preservation**for complex station movements **Confidence building**through controlled execution **Rhythm establishment**reducing decision fatigue **Energy awareness**enabling real-time adjustments\n\n### Target Pace Development\n\n**Training Your Race Pace:**\n\n**Threshold Testing:** **15-20 minute time trial**to establish baseline pace **Account for station fatigue**by adding 10-15 seconds per km **Environmental factors**like temperature and humidity **Course variations**including turns and surface changes\n\n**Pace Range Strategy:** **Early race**: Start 5-10 seconds slower than target pace **Mid-race**: Settle into target pace rhythm **Late race**: Allow natural slight progression if feeling strong **Emergency protocol**: Have backup paces for different scenarios\n\n**Technology Integration:** **GPS watch monitoring**with pace alerts **Heart rate guidance**to prevent early overexertion **Split tracking**for real-time pacing feedback **Post-race analysis**for future strategy refinement\n\n### Adapting to Course Conditions\n\n**Technical Considerations:**\n\n**Turn Management:** **Reduce stride length**approaching tight corners **Maintain effort level**rather than absolute pace **Use banking**to maintain momentum efficiently **Quick acceleration**out of turns without surge\n\n**Elevation Changes:** **Uphill strategy**: Maintain effort, accept pace reduction **Downhill technique**: Use gravity without overstriding **Flat sections**: Return to target pace smoothly **Mental preparation**: Expect pace variations with terrain\n\n**Station Approach Strategy:** **100-200m deceleration**before each station **Controlled finish**avoiding abrupt stopping **Mental transition**beginning station focus **Energy conservation**for upcoming demands\n\n## Tip 2: Efficient Pacing on Erg Machines\n\nErg machines (SkiErg and rowing) require specific pacing approaches that balance power output with energy conservation. Unlike running, these stations demand technical precision combined with metabolic management.\n\n### SkiErg Pacing Strategy\n\n**Distance Breakdown (1000m):**\n\n**Opening 200m (20% of distance):** **Start conservatively**at 60-70% perceived effort **Focus on technique**establishing rhythm and breathing **Avoid early sprint**that creates oxygen debt **Build confidence**with controlled, smooth strokes\n\n**Middle 600m (60% of distance):** **Settle into target pace**based on training benchmarks **Maintain stroke rate**around 45-55 strokes per minute **Monitor split times**ensuring consistent output **Preserve energy**for final push and upcoming stations\n\n**Final 200m (20% of distance):** **Assess energy levels**and upcoming station demands **Increase intensity**only if sustainable for race goals **Maintain technique**preventing efficiency breakdown **Prepare mentally**for transition to next running segment\n\n### Rowing Machine Optimization\n\n**Technique-Driven Pacing:**\n\n**Stroke Rate Management:** **Target range**: 24-28 strokes per minute **Consistency focus**: Avoid rate fluctuations **Power application**: Emphasis on leg drive and back swing **Recovery efficiency**: Smooth return without rushing\n\n**Split Time Targeting:** **Men's guidelines**: Aim for 1:45-2:10 per 500m split **Women's guidelines**: Target 2:00-2:25 per 500m split **Individual variation**: Based on training benchmarks **Energy management**: Sustainable effort for entire distance\n\n**Common Erg Mistakes:** **Starting too fast**and fading dramatically **Inconsistent stroke rates**wasting energy **Poor technique**under fatigue **Ignoring upcoming demands**and overexertion\n\n## Tip 3: Pacing Strategy for Sled Work\n\nSled push and pull stations represent the highest strength demands in HYROX, requiring careful energy management to avoid complete depletion while maintaining competitive times.\n\n### Understanding Sled Demands\n\n**Physiological Challenges:** **High force production**requiring significant power **Anaerobic energy system**stress and lactate production **Neuromuscular fatigue**affecting subsequent performance **Core stability**demands under load\n\n**Strategic Approach:** **Effort management**below 90% maximum heart rate **Rhythm establishment**for consistent power output **Technical focus**maintaining efficient movement patterns **Mental preparation**for sustained difficult effort\n\n### Sled Push Pacing\n\n**Distance Management (50m):**\n\n**First 15m:** **Controlled start**avoiding explosive beginning **Establish rhythm**with consistent step cadence **Monitor technique**maintaining low body position **Build momentum**gradually increasing force application\n\n**Middle 20m:** **Sustain pace**avoiding significant slowdowns **Focus on breathing**preventing oxygen debt **Maintain form**especially core engagement **Mental cues**staying present with current effort\n\n**Final 15m:** **Assess energy**for upcoming sled pull **Maintain effort**avoiding dramatic fade **Prepare transition**mental shift to pulling **Finish strong**without compromising next station\n\n### Sled Pull Technique and Pacing\n\n**Pulling Strategy:**\n\n**Setup Efficiency:** **Quick transition**from push to pull setup **Rope positioning**optimal length and angle **Body angle**efficient pulling mechanics **Grip strategy**sustainable hold for distance\n\n**Execution Pacing:** **Consistent pull rhythm**avoiding jerky movements **Steady backward movement**maintaining momentum **Breathing coordination**with pulling pattern **Mental focus**on technique under fatigue\n\n**Recovery Preparation:** **Controlled completion**avoiding collapse **Immediate movement**toward next running segment **Mental reset**preparing for aerobic transition **Energy assessment**for remaining race demands\n\n## Tip 4: Effective Transition Management\n\nTransitions in HYROX can account for 2-8 minutes of total race time, making efficiency in these moments crucial for competitive performance. Elite athletes master transitions through systematic preparation and execution.\n\n### Transition Fundamentals\n\n**Time Targets:** **Elite level**: 5-10 seconds per transition **Competitive level**: 10-20 seconds per transition **Recreational level**: 15-30 seconds per transition **Efficiency factors**: Equipment familiarity, mental preparation, movement quality\n\n**Energy Management During Transitions:** **Active recovery**: Light movement maintaining circulation **Breathing control**: Steady rhythm supporting recovery **Mental preparation**: Focus shift to upcoming demands **Strategic rest**: Minimal time, maximum recovery benefit\n\n### Systematic Transition Approach\n\n**Pre-Station Preparation:** **Visual scanning**for equipment and setup requirements **Mental rehearsal**of station-specific technique **Pace management**approaching station appropriately **Energy assessment**for upcoming demands\n\n**Station Setup:** **Equipment familiarity**from training preparation **Efficient movement**minimal wasted motion **Quick adjustments**based on available equipment **Mental focus**avoiding distraction and confusion\n\n**Post-Station Recovery:** **Controlled completion**avoiding abrupt stops **Immediate movement**toward next segment **Recovery breathing**during movement **Preparation mindset**for upcoming challenges\n\n### Movement Quality in Transitions\n\n**Physical Considerations:** **Maintain posture**avoiding fatigue-induced slouching **Controlled pace**balancing speed with energy conservation **Joint mobility**preventing stiffness between stations **Coordination preservation**maintaining movement quality\n\n**Mental Strategies:** **Focus management**smooth attention transitions **Stress control**staying calm under time pressure **Decision making**quick, effective choices **Confidence maintenance**trusting preparation and skills\n\n## Tip 5: Building Intensity Throughout the Race\n\nStrategic intensity progression allows you to finish stronger while maintaining competitive performance throughout the race. This approach requires disciplined early restraint combined with systematic progression.\n\n### Heart Rate Zone Management\n\n**Early Race Strategy (Stations 1-3):** **Target zone**: 70-75% maximum heart rate **Purpose**: Establish rhythm and conserve energy **Running pace**: 5-10 seconds slower than goal pace **Station effort**: Controlled, sustainable intensity\n\n**Mid-Race Progression (Stations 4-6):** **Target zone**: 75-85% maximum heart rate **Purpose**: Maintain competitive pace while building **Running pace**: Target race pace **Station effort**: Increased intensity with control\n\n**Late Race Push (Stations 7-8):** **Target zone**: 85-95% maximum heart rate **Purpose**: Access remaining energy reserves **Running pace**: Slightly faster than target if feeling strong **Station effort**: Near maximum sustainable effort\n\n### Progressive Intensity Implementation\n\n**Monitoring Indicators:**\n\n**Physical Markers:** **Heart rate stability**during running segments **Breathing control**remaining conversational early **Movement quality**maintaining technique standards **Energy sensation**awareness of remaining reserves\n\n**Performance Benchmarks:** **Split consistency**in early running segments **Station times**compared to training benchmarks **Transition efficiency**maintaining quick changes **Overall feel**subjective energy and motivation\n\n### Real-World Application: Elite Example\n\n**Case Study - 2022 HYROX World Championships:**\n\n**Tobias Lautwein's Strategy:** **First 6km**: Consistent 3:30/km pace (controlled effort) **Final 2km**: Progression to 3:15/km (strategic acceleration) **Result**: World Championship victory through disciplined pacing\n\n**Key Takeaways:** **Early restraint**created energy reserves for final push **Consistent monitoring**enabled strategic decisions **Progressive intensity**built throughout race **Mental discipline**resisted early competitive pressure\n\n### Final Station Strategy\n\n**Wall Ball Station Approach:** **Energy assessment**: Honest evaluation of remaining capacity **Pacing plan**: Break reps into manageable sets **Mental preparation**: Final push mentality **Technique focus**: Maintain efficiency under fatigue\n\n**Finishing Strong Protocol:** **Last running segment**: Use remaining energy reserves **Mental push**: Access competitive drive **Form maintenance**: Avoid injury-risking deterioration **Celebration preparation**: Finish with strength and pride\n\n## Integration and Race Day Application\n\n### Combining All Five Tips\n\n**Unified Strategy:** **Establish steady running rhythm**(Tip 1) from the start **Apply erg efficiency**(Tip 2) to conserve energy **Master sled work pacing**(Tip 3) for strength stations **Optimize all transitions**(Tip 4) for time savings **Build intensity progressively**(Tip 5) throughout race\n\n**Training Integration:** **Practice each element**separately in training **Combine strategies**in race simulation sessions **Test under fatigue**when tired and stressed **Refine through experience**and post-race analysis\n\n### Technology and Monitoring\n\n**Recommended Tools:** **GPS watch**with pace alerts and heart rate monitoring **Training analysis**software for strategy development **Video review**of technique under fatigue **Post-race data**analysis for continuous improvement\n\n**Key Metrics to Track:** **Running split consistency**across all segments **Heart rate zones**throughout race duration **Transition times**between stations **Overall pacing adherence**to planned strategy\n\n## Conclusion: Mastering HYROX Pacing for Success\n\nEffective pacing in HYROX requires a sophisticated understanding of energy management across multiple movement modalities. The five strategies outlined here provide a comprehensive framework for optimizing performance while managing the unique demands of mixed-modal endurance competition.\n\n**Pacing Mastery Principles:**\n\n**Consistency Over Speed**: Maintain steady effort rather than pursuing aggressive early pace that leads to dramatic fading.\n\n**Energy Conservation**: Preserve capacity for later stations through intelligent early restraint and efficient technique.\n\n**Strategic Progression**: Build intensity systematically throughout the race to finish stronger than you started.\n\n**Technical Excellence**: Use transitions and station efficiency to gain competitive advantages beyond pure fitness.\n\n**Mental Discipline**: Resist competitive pressure and trust your preparation and pacing strategy.\n\n**Your Pacing Development Plan:** **Establish**your individual pace targets through testing and training **Practice**each pacing strategy separately and in combination **Test**your approach during race simulation sessions **Refine**your strategy based on training feedback and race experience **Execute**with confidence and discipline on race day **Analyze**post-race data to continuously improve your approach\n\nRemember: pacing is a skill that improves with practice and experience.

Easy jog, bike, or row. Keep it easy. Your goal is to raise body temperature and begin deep breathing through your nose when possible.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Minutes eight to ten: short pace pickups\n\nDo two to three short efforts that bring you to race pace without going above it. Think twenty to thirty seconds each with easy walking between. This primes your nervous system and makes the first run feel familiar.\n\n### Minutes eleven to twelve: station specific rehearsal\n\nIf you can, touch the SkiErg or rower, and do a few light wall ball reps. The goal is not fatigue. It is coordination. One minute of easy practice is enough.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### How early should I warm up for Hyrox?\n\nStart your warm up about twenty to thirty minutes before your wave. Finish your last pickup five to ten minutes before the start so you feel primed but not tired.\n\n### How long should a Hyrox warm up be?\n\nMost athletes do best with ten to fifteen minutes. Shorter can leave you stiff. Longer can burn energy you need for the race.\n\n### Should I warm up on the SkiErg before Hyrox?\n\nIf you can, yes. A short easy touch helps coordination. Keep it light and stop well before you feel fatigued.",

          "snippet": "HYROX arenas are a sweaty battleground of sled pushes, burpees and athletes who seem to have a t-shirt allergy \ud83d\ude1c In all seriousness, the high intensity effort required to complete a HYROX means it\u2019s vital that you go into your races with a fuel and hydration strategy that\u2019ll help you maintain your performance.\n\nSo, it\u2019s no surprise that a growing number of HYROX competitors are reaching out to our Athlete Support Team for guidance on how to approach fueling their competitions\u2026\n\n### Do you really need to fuel and hydrate a HYROX?\n\nFor the uninitiated, HYROX is a unique blend of endurance and strength, featuring eight rounds that each consist of a one-kilometre run followed by a functional workout station. Finish times range from ~55 minutes for the elites to around three hours for those grinding it out, with the \u2018average competitor\u2019 clocking in at just under 90 minutes.\n\nMel, from our Athlete Support Team, completed a HYROX race in 70 minutes and her average heart rate was 154bpm, which is ~96% of her maximum heart rate of 161bpm. That kind of sustained effort is comparable to running a half marathon or smashing out a sprint-distance triathlon, where glycogen stores are key to performance.\n\nThe constant switch between running and high-intensity efforts forces your body to toggle between aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, making carbohydrate availability crucial. Once your glycogen stores run low, fatigue kicks in, power output drops, and suddenly the rowing station starts to feel like a\n\n*very* long grind...\n\n*Image Credit: Strive \u00a9*\n\nAs well as burning through your glycogen stores, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019re going to be sweating a lot through those high intensity efforts. Inadequate fluid and sodium intake can result in progressive dehydration, leading to increased plasma osmolality, reduced blood volume, and impaired thermoregulation. This in turn can cause muscle cramping, decreased neuromuscular function, and cognitive decline.\n\nSo, replacing an adequate proportion of the fluid you lose through sweat (and the sodium you lose in that sweat) is very important to sustain your performance.\n\nBut before we consider how to approach fueling and hydration\n\n*during* a HYROX, it\u2019s important to ensure you get to the start line in optimal condition\u2026\n\n### How to START your HYROX fueled\n\nStarting well-fueled is critical - providing your body with the energy it needs to sustain the hard efforts and delay fatigue. When fully stocked, your body can store ~500g of glucose as glycogen in your muscles, and ~100g in your liver, which is enough to fuel moderate to high-intensity exercise for ~60-90 minutes.\n\nSo, for most HYROX competitors, your glycogen stores serve as your primary energy source. If your glycogen levels are running low to begin with, fatigue will creep in, your strength and power output will be limited and your recovery between stations slowed down. Research shows that starting with \u201cfull\u201d glycogen stores helps delay these issues so you can maintain a higher intensity across the entire event.\n\n**How to fuel the day before your event:**\n\nOn a regular day, most people consume around 3-6 grams of carbohydrate per kilogram of body weight. However, for an event like HYROX, a more structured approach to carb-loading could be beneficial - especially if you expect to race for over two hours.\n\nFor most athletes, aiming for a minimum of 8g of carbohydrate per kg of body weight in the 24 hours leading up to the event helps ensure your muscle and liver glycogen stores are fully \u2018stocked\u2019.\n\n**How to fuel race morning:**\n\nA high-carb meal a few hours before your race helps maximise glycogen stores and ensures you start well-fueled. When it comes to pre-race food choices, stick to familiar, high-carb, low-fibre, and low-fat foods in the days leading up to and on race day to minimise the risk of GI discomfort.\n\nSince the start time of HYROX competitions varies, the best approach is to work backwards from your start time to plan your pre-race nutrition:\n\n**T- 2-3 hours**: High-carb, low-fibre meal (e.g., toast, rice, porridge) **T- 1-2 hours**: Carb-rich snack (e.g., 1-2 x PF 30 Chew, energy bar, rice) **T- 30 minutes**: Another carb-rich snack (e.g., PF 30 Caffeine Gel, PF 30 Chew, energy bar, banana)\n\nThis approach helps ensure you hit the start line feeling primed, rather than running on fumes by station three.\n\n### How to START your HYROX hydrated\n\nMany athletes unknowingly start events dehydrated, which can negatively affect both performance and perceived effort. A 2019 review found that 40-50% of recreationally active individuals begin exercise in a mildly dehydrated state. To optimise hydration, try preloading with a strong electrolyte drink like PH 1500.\n\nTest out this preloading protocol before your longer and sweatier training sessions, so you\u2019re confident of implementing it on race day:\n\n**The night before**: Drink 1 x PH 1500 tablet or packet with ~500ml (~16oz) of water **90 minutes before** **exercise**: Drink 1 x PH 1500 tablet or packet with ~500ml (~16oz) of water to ensure you start fully hydrated\n\nElectrolytes - especially sodium - play an important role in fluid balance, muscle function, and preventing cramping. Preloading increases plasma volume, which gives you a hydration \u2018buffer\u2019 so you can sweat from a larger 'pool' of fluid, tolerate more sweat loss before performance suffers, and sustain performance for longer..\n\n### Should you eat and drink DURING a HYROX?\n\nGiven HYROX events typically last between 1-3 hours, a strategic approach to your carb intake can help maintain your energy levels by delaying glycogen depletion.\n\n**Fuel Tips:**\n\n- If you\u2019re racing for less than 75 minutes, carry some carb-rich gels or chews for quick energy boosts during the run or less intense moments. These can help top up energy levels without disrupting your rhythm\n\n- Given that HYROX involves high-intensity strength and endurance efforts over an extended period, effectively training your gut to tolerate carbs is crucial. Optimising the gastrointestinal system\u2019s ability to absorb and utilise fuel and fluids efficiently can help maintain hydration, sustain energy levels, and reduce the risk of gut distress. This ensures you can perform at high intensity without the discomfort or performance decline associated with poor nutrient absorption or dehydration\n\n- You may want to consider using caffeine as 3-6mg of caffeine per kilo of body weight has been scientifically proven to enhance performance by reducing perceived effort and delaying fatigue. Given that caffeine has a half life of ~4-5 hours, it\u2019s likely that a cup of coffee or caffeine hit via other means around an hour\n\n*before*your HYROX could give you that extra boost - especially for later start times, when tiredness from the day may already be kicking in\n\n*Image Credit: F45 training \u00a9*\n\n**Hydration Tips:**\n\nWith limited opportunities to grab fluids (and the risk of turning the arena into a slip 'n slide if you have a particularly high sweat rate), starting well-hydrated is your best bet.\n\n- Studies have shown that more than a 2% loss of body weight from dehydration can reduce power output and impair cognitive function\n\n- Where possible, sip water at the aid stations in the Rox Zone to manage thirst and minimise fluid loss\n\n- Carrying a soft flask in your pocket or belt with some electrolytes can help maintain hydration and replenish sodium lost through heavy sweating (plus it\u2019s easy to discard when empty)\n\n##### How to fuel different race durations\n\n**Race duration: <75 minutes**\n\n- Focus on pre-event fueling to carry you through\n\n- Eat a caffeine gel or chew in the final 30 minutes before your competition starts\n\n- Carry an additional gel for a mid-race boost\n\n- Sip water from aid stations if needed\n\n**Race duration: 75 minutes \u2013 2 hours**\n\n- Eat a caffeine gel or chew in the last 30 minutes before the start\n\n- Aim for 30\u201360g of carbs per hour using gels or chews\n\n- Take them during easier sections or rest periods to avoid GI discomfort\n\n- Carry a 500ml (16oz) soft flask of electrolytes to stay hydrated and replace lost sodium\n\n**Race duration: >2 hours**\n\n- Eat a caffeine gel or chew in the last 30 minutes before the start\n\n- Aim for 30\u201360g of carbs per hour to prevent energy dips from glycogen depletion\n\n- Carry a 500ml (16oz) soft flask of electrolytes to stay hydrated and replace lost sodium\n\n- Take on additional fluid from aid stations as needed, particularly in humid environments\n\nBy fine-tuning your fuel and hydration strategy, you\u2019ll keep your energy levels high, your power output steady, and your burpees looking (relatively) strong all the way to the finish.\n\n### Post-HYROX recovery\n\nAs tempting as it can be after a HYROX, recovery isn\u2019t just about lying on the floor. A proactive approach to refueling and rehydrating can have a positive impact on how you\u2019re able to bounce back from an event\u2026\n\n**Fuel: Rebuild and Replenish**\n\nRefueling quickly will help repair damaged muscles and replenish your energy stores. A mix of simple carbohydrates, like glucose and fructose, helps restore both muscle and liver glycogen more efficiently. Delaying carbohydrate intake can negatively impact both recovery and subsequent performance, so don\u2019t wait too long before getting food in.\n\n- Research suggests that muscle damage from eccentric exercise (like those lung-burning sled pulls and wall balls) can impair muscle glycogen replenishment\n\n- To counter this, aim for a high-carb meal with some protein soon after finishing (~60-80g of carbs and ~20-30g of protein)\n\n- Continue prioritising carbs throughout the day and in the next 24 hours to optimise recovery\n\nIf you plan to train again soon, planning a more aggressive refueling strategy will help replace glycogen stores rapidly.\n\n**Hydration: Replace What You Lost**\n\nMost athletes finish HYROX dehydrated. PF&H COO, Jonny Tye carried out some sweat rate testing during his race simulation sessions and found that he loses 2-2.5L of sweat per hour. So, you\u2019re basically leaving a small puddle of yourself behind. Replacing lost fluids with electrolytes, not just water, is key to recovering properly.\n\n- High sweat rates are common in high-intensity events like HYROX, making rehydration with sodium crucial\n\n- If you\u2019re training again soon or have another race coming up, a more aggressive rehydration strategy is needed\n\n- In these cases, drinking PH 1500 within 30-60 minutes post-HYROX will aid fluid retention, restore electrolyte balance, and help you recover faster\n\n*Image Credit: The Revolution Gym, Ringwood*\n\nFinally, to give you an insight into how different athletes have fueled and hydrated their HYROX races, I\u2019ve shared some case studies:\n\nIf you need help tailoring your plan for your HYROX race, you can book a free one-to-one video call with one of our team, or drop us an email at hello@fandh.com.\n\n",

          "snippet": "We recently had the opportunity to speak with George Anderson, a well-being and performance coach, a speaker and a very impressive athlete, about the mental side of competing in HYROX events.\n\nIn our conversation, George spoke about how mindset is a critical factor that can separate the top performers from the rest of the pack. While physical attributes like strength and endurance certainly matter, developing grit and the ability to embrace discomfort is what allows competitors to find their limits and push past them \u2013 especially in a sport such as HYROX.\n\nHere are some of George\u2019s top strategies for getting your mind right as a HYROX athlete\u2026\n\n**Get Out of The Chair**\n\nThis concept comes from George\u2019s experience of running a 100-mile ultra marathon. Around mile 65, exhausted and demoralised in the middle of the night, he made the mistake of sitting down in a chair. As soon as he sat down, it became extremely difficult to motivate himself to get back up and keep going \u2013 even though he still had 35 gruelling miles left.\n\nGeorge realised that the key was not to think about the full 35 miles, but just focus on getting out of the chair first. If he could just stand up, he would be able to take the next step. And eventually, taking those small steps would get him to the finish line.\n\n\n\n*In HYROX, just focus on getting through the next rep, or element, rather than thinking of the whole race,*\u201d George advised. \u201c *Get that first burpee done rather than dwelling on 80 metres of them, for example.*\u201c\n\nThis strategy applies perfectly to the constant surges and transitions in a HYROX workout. When you\u2019re gassed at a station but know you must push through so much more, don\u2019t let yourself get overwhelmed by what\u2019s to come. Just refocus and commit to nailing the first few reps. Maintaining that short-term focus will keep you present, motivated, and moving forward. This is something that the Men\u2019s pro winner in HYROX London, Harry Thompson, also spoke about when we interviewed him.\n\n**No Rep Yourself**\n\nGeorge believes in holding himself to high standards in training when it comes to movement quality. Even when training alone, he does not count sloppy reps.\n\nThis instills an important discipline that helps to minimise the chances of no reps from judges in competition. By thoroughly ingraining proper technique over time, it becomes second nature.\n\nHYROX athletes can apply this mentality of \u201cno repping yourself\u201d in their own training. For example, if you fail to hit the target on a wall ball rep in practice, call yourself out on it and don\u2019t count the rep. This type of discipline prepares you (mentally and physically) to maintain composure if a judge calls you out mid-race. You\u2019ll be ready to shake it off and calmly crank out more perfect reps.\n\n**Create a Race Day Routine **\n\nGeorge recognizes that the atmosphere at HYROX venues can trigger nerves and anxiety for some competitors. He recommends several strategies to harness these nerves as fuel rather than letting them derail your performance\u2026\n\nFirst, remind yourself why you are there \u2013 to challenge yourself, improve your mental toughness, and become better than you were yesterday. Yes the race is hard, but that\u2019s why you\u2019re there.\n\nSecond, have a plan for how you will pace certain elements and transitions in the race. Feeling mentally prepared with a strategy will help calm nerves. There\u2019s nothing like knowing you\u2019re prepared for what lies ahead to help calm you!\n\nThirdly, remember there is nothing to be nervous about, the community is welcoming and supporting, not intimidating or judgmental.\n\nFinally, develop pre-race rituals that settle you into that optimal zone \u2013 pumped up but focused. This might involve listening to certain music, visualising your race, or jumping around to feed off the infectious energy in the venue. Find what works for you.\n\n**Embrace the Suck**\n\nA key mindset shift George recommends is embracing pain and discomfort, rather than fearing it. Remind yourself that HYROX is supposed to be hard \u2013 that\u2019s the whole point! You want to finish feeling like you left it all out on the floor.\n\n\n\n*Those feelings of pain and exertion can be quite unnerving to some if you aren\u2019t used to it. When you instead see them as signals that you\u2019re giving maybe another 5-10%, and that it\u2019s not going to get any worse, and you just need to sustain this for a short period of time, that does something quite fundamental to your motivation and how you perceive the effort you\u2019re putting in*\u201d George explained.\n\nHe\n\n*continued \u201cI remember interviewing Liz Yelling, a world-class half marathon runner, many years ago. She explained that among distance running elites, there is likely very little separating them physically in areas like VO2 max, strength and speed. However, what sets the top performers apart is their willingness to suffer \u2013 their ability to embrace discomfort and simply endure more pain than others. \u201c*\n\nThis willingness to suffer, and sit with physical discomfort, is what separates the good from the great. Adopting this mindset allows you to turn up the intensity when every fibre in your body is telling you to back off. You\u2019ll be able to push into zones you never thought possible.\n\n**Through the Line**\n\nA lesson George learned from his track coach is the importance of running through the finish line rather than slowing down prematurely. This applies to HYROX races too (and training).\n\nOn elements like the walking lunges, in training, it\u2019s common to finish a rep and be a few inches short of your prescribed distance. It would be easy to finish the set there. But George suggests always going through the line \u2013 do one more rep. It\u2019s an important discipline to practice, as that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d need to do come race day.\n\n\n\n*Always think about going beyond the end point, going through the line. Don\u2019t lose that last little bit of performance which could make it or break it,*\u201d George advised.\n\nThis through-the-line mindset ensures you never leave anything on the table by coasting early.\n\n**Overcome and Become **\n\nGeorge believes one of the greatest benefits of HYROX is the opportunity it provides for competitors to discover their true limits and overcome them in a relatively safe environment. This transforms how you see yourself.\n\nHe recommends taking time after each tough training session to reflect on how you were able to push past resistance in your own mind \u2013 when that voice was telling you to slow down or quit. By recognising that you overcame your perceived limits, you start to adopt a new identity as the type of athlete / person who can face adversity head-on and keep grinding.\n\nThis \u201covercome and become\u201d mindset creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you cement your identity as someone who always goes the extra mile, you will be far more likely to replicate that resilience and determination in future challenges. HYROX provides the perfect environment to develop this kind of mentality.\n\n**Summary**\n\nGeorge firmly believes that cultivating your mental game is what transforms good HYROX competitors into great ones on race day. By applying techniques like getting out of the chair, no-repping yourself, and overcoming nerves, you can unlock performance levels you didn\u2019t know were possible. Not only will your race day times improve, but you\u2019ll emerge with a mental toughness that translates far beyond HYROX.\n\nYou can follow George on Instagram.

          "snippet": "Aerobic base training is the foundation of all HYROX performance. It develops the low-intensity engine that allows you to run efficiently, recover faster between stations, and handle long race duration\u2019s without your heart rate drifting too high. Zone 2 training strengthens the cardiovascular system, increases mitochondrial density, improves fat utilisation, and stabilises your pacing ability.\n\n\u2026\n\nOn machines, a 3:1 ratio works well. But unlike VO\u2082 max training, where shorter intervals are ideal, HYROX benefits far more from longer threshold bouts because the event itself is one long grind without significant recovery. Long intervals of 10 minutes or more allow your heart rate to stay elevated, preventing the heart rate dip that comes from short rest periods and forces your body to stay in that sustained discomfort zone that mirrors race conditions.",

          "snippet": "## Why should I use heart rate training?\n\n**Optimised VO2Max Training:**Targeting sessions at 95% of maximum heart rate enables HYROX athletes to effectively enhance their VO2Max. Short, intense intervals within this heart rate zone are crucial for boosting aerobic capacity, essential for the high-energy demands of HYROX. **Effective Threshold Work:**Utilising heart rate monitoring to train at lactate threshold intensity is vital for HYROX.\n\n\u2026\n\n**Tailored Training Intensities:**Heart rate data allows HYROX competitors to customise their training. Using heart rate zones for easy recovery runs ensures proper recovery, while higher zones on interval days align efforts with training goals. **Preventing Overtraining:**Regular heart rate monitoring during different training phases helps HYROX athletes avoid overtraining. By ensuring high-intensity days are truly challenging and rest days are used for recovery, it maintains a balanced training regime.Limitations of Heart Rate Training\n\nDespite these advantages, heart rate training also has its limitations.\n\n\u2026\n\n**How It Works:**The test involves incremental exercise bouts or a steady-state exercise where lactate levels in the blood are measured at different intensities. **Benefits:**Identifying your lactate threshold provides a precise heart rate marker for designing training sessions. Training just below the lactate threshold can enhance endurance, while training just above can improve lactate clearance and high-intensity performance. **Application in Training:**By knowing your lactate threshold, you can tailor your heart rate zones more accurately, ensuring each training session is optimised for maximum efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n\u2026\n\n**Zone 3 - High Aerobic Zone (tempo - 70-80%MHR)**\n\nThe high aerobic zone is just above your aerobic threshold. Training here will see similar benefits of training in zone 2, however you\u2019re also subjecting your body to more stress, which can impede subsequent more important sessions in the week (VO2Max and Threshold work). If the race you are training for lies within this zone (\u00bd marathon/marathon) then you still need to spend some time here to understand your race pace.\n**Zone 4 - Threshold Zone (**80-90% **MHR**)\n\nZone 4 skirts around your second Lactate Threshold (LT2). At this point you become better at withstanding lactic acid and removing it, and you are able to increase your anaerobic threshold closer to your VO2 max. This means you can race harder for longer. Training in Zone 4 can lead to significant performance gains but should be balanced with adequate recovery.",

Long strides create a stop-start pattern\u2014you decelerate between steps. Short, rapid steps keep constant forward pressure on the sled. Think of it like pedaling a bike in low gear versus high gear up a hill.\n\n\u2026\n\n### Fix #4: Never Let the Sled Stop\n\n**\u274c MISTAKE:** Stopping completely to rest, letting the sled become stationary.\n\n**\u2705 FIX:** Slow but constant movement. \"Rest\" by going 70% speed, but never stop.\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf WHY IT WORKS: The Physics of Friction**\nStatic friction (stopping) > kinetic friction (moving). When the sled stops, you need 3-5x more energy to restart it than to keep it crawling forward. It's like starting your car from a dead stop versus rolling start\u2014one costs way more fuel.\n\n**Strategy:** Better to slow to a painful crawl than to pause. Even 1-2 inch per second movement is better than zero.

          "snippet": "# Your Ultimate Guide to Nailing Your Hyrox Warm-Up\n\nWhen it comes to Hyrox or any hybrid race, your warm-up plays a crucial role in setting the tone for the event. Unfortunately, warm-ups are often rushed or completely overlooked. But here\u2019s the thing: a proper Hyrox warm-up isn\u2019t just about breaking a sweat. It\u2019s about preparing your body and mind for peak performance. Let\u2019s explore how you can nail your Hyrox warm-up and crush your race-day goals.\n\n### Why Your Hyrox Warm-Up Matters\n\nThink of your Hyrox warm-up as the foundation for your performance. The goal is to activate your muscles, stimulate your aerobic system, and mentally shift into \u201cgo mode.\u201d Skipping this step can leave you feeling unprepared or sluggish during the event. On the other hand, overdoing it can sap your energy. The key is finding a warm-up routine that\u2019s efficient, consistent, and tailored to your needs.\n\n### Step-by-Step: The Perfect Hyrox Warm-Up Routine\n\n**1. Arrive Early (60\u201390 Minutes Before Start Time)**\n\nArriving early gives you time to get organized and eliminate unnecessary stress. Here\u2019s what to do:\n\nCheck in and grab your race bib.\n\nLocate the bathrooms\u2014trust us, this can save your day.\n\nScout the warm-up area. Check for space to jog, treadmills, or bikes.\n\nMentally prepare by visualizing the race and your strategy.\n\nPro tip: If the warm-up area is crowded or limited, consider warming up at your hotel or outside.\n\n**2. Start Aerobic Activation (45 Minutes Out)**\n\nBegin your Hyrox warm-up about 45 minutes before race time. This phase is about easing into movement without overexerting yourself. Spend 7\u201310 minutes on low-intensity aerobic work, such as light jogging or a mix of running, biking, and rowing. The goal is to get your blood flowing and activate your aerobic system. Don\u2019t stress if you feel a bit sluggish at this point. That\u2019s normal, especially if you\u2019re feeling pre-race jitters. Trust the process and keep moving.\n\n**3. Ramp Up the Intensity (30 Minutes Out)**\n\nNow it\u2019s time to elevate your heart rate and simulate race conditions. Follow this progression:\n\nAfter your initial aerobic work, rest for 1\u20132 minutes.\n\nRun or row for 3 minutes at a steady effort, like marathon pace. This primes your body for harder efforts.\n\nTake another short rest, then hit a 500-meter ski erg at your target race pace (2k pace + 5\u20137 seconds).\n\nThis stage of your Hyrox warm-up ensures your body is ready to handle race-level intensity without burning out too early.\n\n**4. Mobility and Station-Specific Drills (15 Minutes Out)**\n\nWith your aerobic system activated, shift focus to mobility and station-specific movements. Spend 5\u201310 minutes on stretches and drills. Prioritize areas like:\n\nHip flexors and quads (for running and lunges)\n\nShoulders and lats (for ski erg and rowing)\n\nAnkles and calves (for running and jumping)\n\nPractice light reps of key race movements:\n\nPush the sled for 10 meters to get a feel for the surface.\n\nPerform 3\u20135 burpee broad jumps to engage your core.\n\nCarry the farmer handles for 10\u201315 meters to prep your grip.\n\nThe goal here is to build confidence and familiarity with the movements without overexerting yourself.\n\n**5. Final Preparations (5\u201310 Minutes Out)**\n\nAs your Hyrox warm-up wraps up, it\u2019s time to focus on the final touches:\n\nPut on your race shoes and test them with a few strides.\n\nPerform short sprints (10\u201315 seconds) at a pace slightly faster than your race effort. Walk or jog for 30 seconds between reps. This sharpens your turnover and engages fast-twitch muscle fibers.\n\nTake a moment to breathe, calm your mind, and visualize your plan. Confidence is key as you step into the starting gate.\n\n**Common Warm-Up Mistakes in Hyrox Races** **Skipping the Warm-Up**Skipping your Hyrox warm-up to save energy is a big mistake. A proper warm-up primes your body for effort and reduces injury risk. **Overdoing It**Avoid exhausting yourself with an overly intense warm-up. The goal is to prepare, not deplete your energy. **Letting the Warm-Up Dictate Your Race**How you feel during the warm-up doesn\u2019t always predict race performance. Treat the warm-up as a separate task and trust your training. **Winging It**Don\u2019t leave your warm-up to chance. Practice and refine your routine during training to build familiarity and confidence. **Bonus Tips for Hyrox Warm-Up Success** **Hydration and Nutrition**\n\nStay hydrated with electrolytes throughout the day. Avoid plain water, as it doesn\u2019t replace lost sodium and minerals. If you need a quick energy boost, consume a gel, gummy bears, or a carb drink 10\u201315 minutes before the race.\n\n**Caffeine Strategy**\n\nIf caffeine is part of your routine, time it carefully. Many athletes benefit from consuming caffeine 30\u201360 minutes before the race. Stick to what you\u2019ve tested in training to avoid surprises.\n\n**Gear Check**\n\nEnsure your race gear\u2014shoes, gloves, and nutrition\u2014is ready to go. Decide in advance if you\u2019ll race with or without a shirt, and know where to stash it if you remove it mid-race.\n\n### Mindset: The Final Piece of Your Hyrox Warm-Up\n\nWhen you step into the starting gate, focus on mental preparation. Use the last few minutes to reflect on your training, visualize your strategy, and embrace the challenge ahead. Whether it\u2019s a mantra, a playlist, or the buzz of the crowd, find what keeps you in the zone.\n\n### Key Takeaway: Consistency Is Key\n\nA great Hyrox warm-up is all about consistency. Practice it during training so it feels natural on race day. While you may need to adapt to venue constraints, sticking to your routine minimizes stress and maximizes confidence.

          "snippet": "As with most sports, there are certain strategies that you can use in HYROX to help get the best possible finishing time. In this article, I\u2019ll share 8 I use to help improve my performance.\n\n**#1. Estimate Run Distance**\n\nI go into each race knowing roughly what pace I think I can hold for each kilometre. And I will keep an eye on this during the race.\n\nHowever, when pacing your runs, you need to appreciate that not all the runs are exactly 1km. HYROX have told me that the total race distance (including the Roxzone) is 8.7km. Therefore, if there is a big Roxzone, it\u2019s possible that each run will be less than 1km (or vice versa). This is something I try to make an estimation of in advance based on the floor plan (which you are sent prior to the event).\n\nSecondly, the first run of the eight is normally shorter or longer than the rest of the runs. This is due to the start line being at a different point to the Roxzone exit. The extent of this changes from race to race. As just one example, in Manchester in January 2023, the first run was probably 200m longer than the others.\n\nBecause I aim to pace my runs to a specific time, I need to adjust my target run pace to account for the different distances of the runs. For example, let\u2019s suppose you know you want to run 4:30m/km. If you estimate the first run to be 1.2km, then you\u2019ll want to run 5:24m for your first run. Failure to do this, could result in you starting the race much too fast or slow.\n\nFor tips on determining your race pace, then check out this article.\n\n**#2. Pace the Ergs**\n\nIt\u2019s worth appreciating that a lot of extra effort on the Ski erg and row machine often doesn\u2019t result in a significantly quicker time. Trying to Ski / Row as quick as you possibly can, will likely exhaust you for the rest of the race. Whereas if you just slow yourself down by, say, 10-15 seconds over the 1km distance, that saves you a LOT of energy.\n\nFinding the appropriate balance between energy expended and time gained on\n\n__all__ elements of HYROX is important. But this is especially the case on the erg machines where a lot more energy often doesn\u2019t go a long way.\n\n**#3. Pace the Sled Push**\n\nI promise this whole article isn\u2019t about just pacing yourself, but it is important! Learning the extent to which you can push on the sled push without ruining your legs can make or break your race. If you smash through the sled push in no time at all, but then can\u2019t walk properly afterwards, you went too quick! This is a mistake even the Elite of the sport make, with many male competitors seemingly ruining their race at the 2023 North American Championships after going too fast on the sled push.\n\nIf you have previously competed in HYROX, I would encourage you to look at your running splits before and after the sled push. Do they slow dramatically? If so, you possibly started out running too fast, or you went too fast on the sled push and couldn\u2019t recover properly afterwards.\n\nFinding the right balance does come from experience, and training, but just being aware of its importance is a starting point. Personally, I find that a short pause halfway on each length (so every 6.25m) helps a lot compared to trying to do each length unbroken.\n\n**#4. Stay Out the Madness**\n\nAt the beginning of each HYROX there can be a LOT of people starting alongside you. In Birmingham in Oct 2022, the Men\u2019s wave had 50 people starting at a time. Personally, I try and stay to the side, or the back, of this group of very excited, pumped up, testosterone fuelled men! Maybe I\u2019m just overly cautious \u2013 and to be fair I\u2019ve never seen it happen \u2013 but it feels as if the greatest risk of being accidentally tripped / pushed over at any point during a HYROX is in those first few seconds. So, I try and stay out of the hustle and bustle to minimise risk without really costing myself time. Your timing chip doesn\u2019t start until you cross the start line anyway, so it doesn\u2019t really matter if you\u2019re not right at the front.\n\n**#5. Full Send Farmers**\n\nAs tough as HYROX is, when I think about it, there are very few individual components of the race which I am doing as fast as I possibly can. Even on the lunges, late in the race, you hold back a tiny amount so you can actually run afterwards. But the farmers carry is one where I think it\u2019s worth doing as quick as humanly possible. That will lessen the number of times you need to put the kettlebells down on the floor (if you do at all). You also don\u2019t really need much grip strength for the rest of the race. So going all out on the farmers is worthwhile.\n\n**#6. Sled Pull Hustle**\n\nIf you look at a lot of people on the sled pull, the amount of time spent actually pulling the sled, relative to the total amount of time they spend in the sled push station, is very small. They often walk (as opposed to run) from one end of the lane to the other and will take long rests between each pull of the rope. I\u2019m not arguing with that \u2013 I\u2019m all for pacing after all, and appreciate some people need more rest than others \u2013 I can\u2019t pretend to be a savage on the sled pull by any means! However, I think sled pull is another area where you can push yourself a little more without compromising yourself too much for the rest of the race. Therefore, I am trying to be very conscious of having a bit of hustle at this station, minimising gaps between pulls of the rope.\n\n**#7. Learn the Order and Floor Plan **\n\nBefore I race, I make sure that the location of each workout zone, and the order in which I need to do them, is firmly imprinted in my mind. I don\u2019t want to be entering the Roxzone wondering whether I need to turn left or right to find the station I\u2019m heading to. It would mean wasted energy / time. So do your homework before the race and be able to visualise it in your mind.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I can\u2019t write this section without admitting one of my own errors. Before Birmingham 2022, I\u2019d fully memorised the layout and the order of stations. Yet when I was meant to be heading into the sled pull, I somehow managed to run back into the sled\n\n*push* station. It wasn\u2019t until I arrived at my sled that I realised my error! So even with the most intentional preparation mistakes can be made!\n\n**#8. Wall Ball Pacing**\n\nOh no he\u2019s going to talk about pacing again! Yes, I am! The wall balls are the last station. You\u2019re soooo close to the finish line. But that doesn\u2019t mean that you should max out. If you can\u2019t do all the 100/75 wall balls unbroken, then you need a strategy as to how many you\n\n*should *do in one go. If you start off by doing as many as you can (say you manage 40 unbroken) but that leaves your shoulders completely fried, and massively slows you down for the remainder, then you didn\u2019t pace appropriately. It\u2019s possible you should have just done 25 instead and had a very short pause, before carrying on. This is something to try and work out in training.\n\nHopefully this helps you for your next race.

However, this \u201cmore is better\u201d approach can be a fast track to injury. Increasing volume too rapidly can lead to issues like shin splints, stress fractures, or runner\u2019s knee, sidelining you for a long period, especially if you don\u2019t have a running background.\n\n\u2026\n\n## 2. Overdoing Intensity\n\nMany HYROX athletes believe that if they\u2019re not running at full speed, they\u2019re not training hard enough. This leads to always running fast, which increases your risk of injury and fatigue (ultimately affecting the quality of your other sessions.).\n\n**How to fix it:**\n\nVary the pace of your runs. Incorporate slow recovery runs, tempo runs, and interval sessions into your training plan. Slower runs help build your aerobic base, while faster intervals can be more specific to the race.\n\n## 3. Underfuelling Training\n\nWhen training for HYROX, you need to make sure you are well fuelled for your sessions. But this is often an area that\u2019s overlooked. Failure to take on adequate nutrition can quickly lead to poor performance during sessions, sluggish recovery afterwards, and a higher risk of fatigue, injury, or muscle cramps.\n\n**How to fix it:**\n\nMake sure you\u2019re consuming enough calories, particularly from carbohydrates, to fuel your training sessions. Stay hydrated and consider fuelling strategies like energy gels or snacks during longer runs.\n\n\u2026\n\n## 5. Skipping Strength Training\n\nHYROX isn\u2019t just about running \u2013 it\u2019s a hybrid race combining strength and endurance. If your training only focuses on running, you\u2019ll likely struggle with exercises like sled pushes, pulls and lunges during the event. Not to mention the fact that strength training can be an important component of your running training for performance and injury prevention.\n\n**How to fix it:**\n\nInclude strength training in your routine. Exercises such as squats, deadlifts, and kettlebell swings will not only improve your running efficiency but also prepare you for the functional aspects of the race.",

Avoid starting too fast and burning out early. **Practice Transitions**: If you\u2019re in the doubles division, practice smooth, efficient transitions with your partner. Time your switches to avoid penalties. **Train Leg Endurance**: Since you cannot put the sandbag down without penalty, make sure your leg endurance is up to par so you can complete the station without dropping the bag.",

          "snippet": "The HYROX sandbag lunges are the station that separates those who understand race strategy from those who are still guessing.\n\nIt's Station 7, coming after 7km of running and six brutal workout stations. Your quads are screaming. You've got 100m of weighted lunges with 20kg (men) or 10kg (women) on your shoulders, followed immediately by 100 wall balls. The instinct? Go conservative. Save the legs for the final run. Survive.\n\nThe data from Hyrox Utrecht says that's exactly the wrong strategy.\n\n## The Sandbag Paradox: High Variability, Low Impact\n\nLet's start with a surprising finding from our analysis of HYROX Utrecht results.\n\nThe sandbag lunges show one of the\n\n**highest time variabilities** of any station. Among athletes finishing between 1:27-1:33 (a tight 6-minute window), sandbag times averaged **5:22 for men** and **4:41 for women**, but ranged dramatically - some athletes completed it in under 3 minutes, while others took over 9 minutes (extreme outliers excluded from analysis).\n\nWhen comparing across finish-time brackets (1:20, 1:30, 1:40), the sandbag lunges show\n\n**87 seconds of variance for men** and **88 seconds for women** - significantly higher than SkiErg (22 seconds) or Row (28 seconds). This massive variance means it's a **high-leverage training target** with serious time-gain opportunity.\n\nBut here's where it gets interesting.\n\n## The Run 8 Correlation: Attack Without Fear\n\nWe analyzed all athletes who finished between 1:27-1:33, examining the relationship between sandbag lunge time and the subsequent Run 8 performance.\n\n**The correlation coefficients:**\n\n- Men:\n\n**-0.084**(essentially zero)\n\n- Women:\n\n**-0.072**(essentially zero)\n\nLook at the scatter plots. The trend lines are nearly flat. Athletes who crushed the lunges in 3:30 ran similar Run 8 times as those who took 7:00. The relationship between sandbag speed and running performance is\n\n**statistically insignificant**.\n\n### What This Means for Your Race Strategy\n\n**Translation: Going hard on the sandbag lunges does not significantly slow your final 1km run.**\n\nThis destroys the common wisdom of \"saving your legs\" for Run 8. Athletes who go conservative on lunges thinking they're banking energy for the run are giving away 30-60 seconds for essentially no benefit on the subsequent run segment.\n\nThe weak correlation exists for good reason:\n\n**Neuromuscular specificity**: Lunge mechanics don't transfer directly to running patterns **Energy systems**: Lunges are primarily anaerobic glycolytic and mechanical fatigue, while running is aerobic with some glycolytic component **Position in race**: When the lunges are over and the last run starts, cumulative fatigue matters more than any single station\n\nThe data is clear:\n\n**attack the sandbag lunges aggressively**. The time you lose going slow hurts your finish time directly, while the theoretical fatigue you're avoiding doesn't materially impact your final run.\n\n## The Step Length Strategy: Biomechanics Matter\n\nNot all lunges are created equal. Your step length determines three critical variables: total rep count, muscular load distribution, and quad preservation for wall balls.\n\n### Step Length Breakdown\n\n|Step Length|Total Steps|Load Distribution|Best For|\n|--|--|--|--|\n|0.6-0.7m|~140-167|Quad-dominant|Beginners, building endurance|\n|0.8-0.9m|~111-125|Balanced|Most athletes - sweet spot|\n|1.0-1.1m|~91-100|Glute/hamstring emphasis|Faster athletes with strong posterior chain|\n|1.2m+|~83-90|Very glute-heavy|Elites only|\n**Key insight:** The longer your step, the more you shift load from quads \u2192 glutes & hamstrings.\n\nThis matters enormously because the\n\n**very next station** after lunges is wall balls - quad hell. Every extra centimeter you can take per lunge saves quad glycogen for the 100+ reps that follow.\n\n### The Sweet Spot: 0.9-1.1m Steps\n\n**For men (aiming for 1:30 or faster):**\n\n- Target:\n\n**100-110 total steps**\n\n- Step length: 0.9-1.0m\n\n- Expected time: 4:30-5:30\n\n**For women (aiming for 1:30 or faster):**\n\n- Target:\n\n**110-120 total steps**\n\n- Step length: 0.85-0.95m\n\n- Expected time: 4:00-5:00\n\nFrom our analysis:\n\n**Men's median sandbag time**: 5:18 (1:27-1:33 bracket) **Women's median sandbag time**: 4:39 (1:27-1:33 bracket)\n\nIf you're slower than these targets, step length is your first lever to pull.\n\n## The Variance Opportunity: Where Time Separates\n\nLook at average sandbag lunge times across finish-time brackets:\n\n**Men:**\n\n- 1:20 bracket: 4:07 avg\n\n- 1:30 bracket: 4:50 avg\n\n- 1:40 bracket: 5:34 avg\n\n**Variance**: 87 seconds (1:27 difference between elite and recreational)\n\n**Women:**\n\n- 1:20 bracket: 3:35 avg\n\n- 1:30 bracket: 4:12 avg\n\n- 1:40 bracket: 5:03 avg\n\n**Variance**: 88 seconds (1:28 difference)\n\n**Context:** Only two stations show higher variance than sandbag lunges:\n\n- Wall Balls: 146 seconds variance\n\n- Burpee Broad Jumps: 107 seconds\n\nCompare this to low-variance stations:\n\n- SkiErg: 22 seconds variance\n\n- Row: 28 seconds variance\n\n- Farmers Carry: 26 seconds variance\n\n**This means sandbag lunges are a HIGH-LEVERAGE training target.** Unlike Row or SkiErg where technique and engine capacity plateau quickly, lunges offer continuous improvement opportunity across all fitness levels. A recreational athlete can gain 60-90 seconds on this station with proper technique and training.\n\n## The Wall Ball Connection: Quad Preservation\n\nWhile sandbag lunges don't correlate with Run 8, they show a\n\n**strong correlation with wall ball performance**: r = 0.738.\n\nThis makes biomechanical sense. Both movements demand:\n\n- Quad endurance under load\n\n- Hip flexor strength (getting knee up)\n\n- Core stability\n\n- Mental resilience through leg fatigue\n\n**The strategic implication:** Your lunge technique directly impacts wall ball capacity. Going quad-dominant on lunges (short steps, upright torso) leaves you with destroyed quads for 100 wall balls. Using longer steps that recruit glutes/hamstrings preserves quad capacity.\n\n**Practical example:**\n\n- Athlete A: 140 short steps (0.7m) on lunges \u2192 quad-dominant loading \u2192 wall balls at 7:30\n\n- Athlete B: 100 longer steps (1.0m) on lunges \u2192 posterior chain emphasis \u2192 wall balls at 6:15\n\nAthlete B saves\n\n**75 seconds on wall balls** by using superior lunge mechanics, and possibly being faster on the lunges themselves (fewer reps because more ground clearance per rep).\n\n## Perfect Sandbag Lunge Technique\n\n### Setup\n\n**Sandbag position**: High on traps, behind neck (not on shoulders) **Foot width**: 30cm apart laterally (prevents wasting distance while maintaining stability) **Starting position**: Stand tall, core braced\n\n### Movement Execution\n\n**1. The Step Forward**\n\n- Drive knee forward and up (hip flexor engagement)\n\n- Aim for 0.9-1.1m step length\n\n- Land on midfoot, not heel\n\n- Keep torso vertical (prevents forward lean that loads quads more)\n\n**2. The Descent**\n\n- Drop back knee STRAIGHT DOWN (not angled back)\n\n- Back knee must touch ground (race requirement)\n\n- Front shin should be vertical (knee over ankle, not past toes)\n\n- Keep chest up, eyes forward\n\n**3. The Drive**\n\n- Push through front foot heel\n\n- Think \"stand up and forward\" not \"push up\"\n\n- Glutes drive the movement (posterior chain emphasis)\n\n- Immediately step into next rep\n\n### Common Technical Errors\n\n|Error|Consequence|Fix|\n|--|--|--|\n|Steps too short|150+ reps, quad overload|Measure 1m, practice hitting that distance|\n|Forward lean|Quad dominance, back fatigue|Chest up, eyes on horizon not floor|\n|Lateral wandering|Wasted distance, 105-110m actual|Set foot spacing, maintain width|\n|Incomplete depth|No-reps, broken rhythm|Back knee MUST touch, every rep|\n|Hesitation at bottom|Energy waste, time loss|Touch-and-go, constant movement|\n### Foot Spacing: Stay Straight, Stay Efficient\n\nPoor line discipline costs time, but not from added distance - it's about\n\n**balance and stability**. If your feet wander laterally in a zigzag pattern, you waste energy stabilizing each step instead of driving forward efficiently.\n\nAthletes who maintain a straight line can stay in a rhythm. Those who drift left and right have to constantly correct their balance, breaking momentum and slowing cadence.\n\n**Fix:** Mark the course mentally. Pick a line (edge of mat, seam in floor) and stay on it. Maintain consistent **foot width** (~30cm for men, ~25cm for women) but keep your forward path **laser-straight**.\n\n## Training Protocol: Lunge Mastery in 6 Weeks\n\n### Phase 1: Weeks 1-2 (Build Capacity)\n\n**Goal:** Develop baseline strength-endurance\n\n**Workout A - Strength Day:**\n\n- Weighted walking lunges: 4 x 50m with 25kg (men) / 15kg (women)\n\n- Bulgarian split squats: 3 x 10 each leg\n\n- Goblet squats: 3 x 15\n\n- Rest: 2-3 min between sets\n\n**Workout B - Endurance Day:**\n\n- Unloaded walking lunges: 3 x 100m\n\n- Focus: perfect form, 0.9-1.0m steps\n\n- Time target: 5:00-6:00 per set\n\n- Rest: 90 seconds between sets\n\nFrequency: 2x per week (one strength, one endurance)\n\n### Phase 2: Weeks 3-4 (Race Specificity)\n\n**Goal:** Practice race conditions\n\n**Workout C - Race Simulation:**\n\n- 1km run at race pace\n\n- 100m weighted lunges (20kg/10kg) at target pace\n\n- 50 wall balls\n\n- Rest 3 min, repeat 2-3x\n\n**Workout D - Technique Under Fatigue:**\n\n- 200 burpees (any pacing)\n\n- Immediately: 100m weighted lunges for time\n\n- Goal: maintain step length when fatigued\n\nFrequency: 2x per week (one simulation, one fatigue test)\n\n### Phase 3: Weeks 5-6 (Peak Performance)\n\n**Goal:** Dial in race pace, perfect technique\n\n**Workout E - Time Trials:**\n\n- Week 5: 3 x 100m weighted lunges, 2 min rest\n\n- Set 1: 90% effort\n\n- Set 2: 95% effort\n\n- Set 3: 100% effort (race pace test)\n\n- Week 6: 1 x 100m weighted lunges max effort\n\n- Record time, step count, technique notes\n\n**Workout F - Station Sequence:**\n\n- Farmers carry: 200m (race weight)\n\n- \u2192 Immediately: Sandbag lunges 100m\n\n- \u2192 Immediately: Wall balls 100 reps\n\n- Full race sequence, no rest between stations\n\nFrequency: Week 5 (2 workouts), Week 6 (1 workout - taper)\n\n### Progression Targets\n\nBy week 6, you should see:\n\n**Time improvement**: 30-60 seconds faster than week 1 **Step count reduction**: -10 to -20 steps (longer steps) **Technique consistency**: Able to maintain form under fatigue **Confidence**: Sandbag station no longer feared\n\n## Race Day Execution\n\n### Pre-Station (During Farmers Carry & Transition)\n\n- Shake out quads during farmers walk\n\n- Mental prep: \"Attack this, quads recover during the run\"\n\n- Position sandbag high on traps, secure grip\n\n### During Station\n\n- First 10 steps: Establish rhythm, find line\n\n- Middle 70 steps: Lock into autopilot, controlled aggression\n\n- Final 20 steps: Push pace, finish strong\n\n- Breathing: Exhale on drive up, inhale at bottom\n\n### Post-Station Strategy\n\n- Don't panic about leg fatigue\n\n- RoxZone: Jog slow if necessary, shake legs\n\n- Wall balls: Trust that posterior-chain-dominant lunges preserved quads\n\n- Run 8: Remember - correlation is near zero, legs will respond\n\n## The Mental Game: Embrace the Suck\n\nSandbag lunges are mentally brutal. 100 meters feels like 1000 meters when you're at Station 7. Here's the psychological framework that helps:\n\n**Reframe the discomfort:**\n\n- \"This doesn't affect my run\" (data-backed truth)\n\n- \"Every second I save here is pure time gain\" (high variance = high reward)\n\n- \"My competitors are going soft here\" (most athletes DO go conservative)\n\n**Break it into chunks:**\n\n- First 25m: \"Just getting started\"\n\n- 25-50m: \"Rhythm established\"\n\n- 50-75m: \"Halfway done, halfway home\"\n\n- 75-100m: \"Sprint finish, smell the wall balls\"\n\n**Use your surroundings:**\n\n- Count down distance markers, not up\n\n- Pick someone ahead to reel in\n\n- Aggressive self-talk (\"Let's go!\" not \"I can do this\")\n\nThe athletes who win this station aren't necessarily the strongest - they're the ones who\n\n**refuse to negotiate with discomfort**.\n\n## Key Takeaways: The New Sandbag Strategy\n\n**1. Attack, Don't Conserve**\n\n- Correlation with Run 8 is nearly zero (-0.084 men, -0.072 women)\n\n- Going conservative saves no meaningful energy for running\n\n- Time lost going slow = direct impact on finish time\n\n**2. Step Length = Everything**\n\n- Target: 0.9-1.1m per step (100-110 total reps)\n\n- Longer steps = more glute/hamstring, less quad\n\n- Quad preservation matters for wall balls (r = 0.738 correlation)\n\n**3. Technique Under Fatigue**\n\n- Practice weighted lunges AFTER metabolic work\n\n- Maintain form when quads are screaming\n\n- Foot spacing discipline (30cm width) prevents distance waste\n\n**4. High-Leverage Training Target**\n\n- 87-88 seconds of variance across finish brackets\n\n- Only Wall Balls, RoxZone, and Burpees offer more improvement potential\n\n- Most athletes under-train this station = easy competitive advantage\n\n**5. Psychological Edge**\n\n- Most athletes go conservative here (fear of Run 8)\n\n- Data shows that fear is unfounded\n\n- Aggressive execution = 30-90 seconds gained on field\n\n## Additional Data: The Burpee Connection\n\nInterestingly, sandbag lunges also show a\n\n**strong correlation with Burpee Broad Jumps** (r = 0.748) - second only to the wall ball correlation.\n\nThis pattern reveals something important:\n\n**leg endurance capacity predicts performance across multiple late-race stations**.\n\nAthletes who excel at lunges typically also excel at:\n\n- Burpee Broad Jumps (explosive leg power + endurance)\n\n- Wall Balls (quad endurance under load)\n\n- Late-race running pace maintenance (Run 6-8)\n\n**The underlying trait:** anaerobic capacity and muscular endurance in the legs under cumulative fatigue.\n\n### Training Implication: Circuit Work\n\nInstead of training lunges in isolation, consider circuits that mirror this correlation:\n\n**Leg Endurance Circuit:**\n\n- 50 burpee broad jumps\n\n- 100m weighted lunges (20kg/10kg)\n\n- 50 wall balls\n\n- Rest 3 min, repeat 3x\n\nThis trains the exact energy system and muscle groups that matter for the Station 5-8 gauntlet.\n\n## Race Day Checklist: Station 7 Mastery\n\nPrint this. Tape it to your bathroom mirror. Review it race morning.\n\n### Pre-Race\n\n- Visualize step length (0.9-1.1m) - know what it feels like\n\n- Review foot spacing cue (30cm width, pick a line)\n\n- Mental frame: \"Attack this, zero impact on Run 8\"\n\n### During Farmers Carry (Station 6)\n\n- Shake out quads during walk (dynamic muscle relaxation)\n\n- Spot the lunge course - identify centerline to follow\n\n- Mental prep: \"Next station is my time to gain\"\n\n### RoxZone (Farmers \u2192 Lunges)\n\n- Position sandbag HIGH on traps, NOT low on shoulders\n\n- Secure grip on bag, adjust before starting\n\n- One deep breath, commit to aggression\n\n### During Lunges (100m)\n\n- First 3 steps: Establish line, rhythm, and step length\n\n- Steps 4-90: Lock into autopilot, trust technique\n\n- Final 10 steps: Push pace, smell wall balls\n\n- Constant movement - touch and go on back knee\n\n### Post-Lunges RoxZone\n\n- Don't panic about leg fatigue (it's normal, won't affect run)\n\n- Walk purposefully to wall balls\n\n- Remind yourself: quads preserved by posterior-chain emphasis\n\n- Wall balls first 20 reps will feel hard - push through\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Should I break up the sandbag lunges with rest periods?\n\nNo. Continuous movement is faster. Every time you stop, you lose momentum and have to re-accelerate the sandbag. Elite athletes go unbroken. Recreational athletes should too - the station is only 100m, not 1km.\n\n### How do I train sandbag lunges if my gym doesn't have 100m space?\n\nDo 4 x 25m segments with a 180\u00b0 turn at each end. Turning adds difficulty (balance challenge), so if you can hit time targets with turns, you'll be faster on the straight race course.\n\n### What if I'm too fatigued to take 1m steps during the race?\n\nThis indicates either: (1) you've over-paced early stations, (2) insufficient leg endurance base, or (3) poor nutrition strategy (glycogen depleted). Fix the root cause - don't adjust lunge strategy to compensate for earlier mistakes.\n\n### Should I use a weight vest or sandbag for training?\n\n**Sandbag on shoulders**, always. Weight vest doesn't replicate the specific stability challenge and load position of race conditions. Train specific to race requirements.\n\n### Are these step length targets realistic for shorter athletes?\n\nYes, with proper hip mobility. Step length isn't purely a function of height - it's hip flexor range + glute strength. Shorter athletes may need slightly shorter steps (0.85-0.95m), but most can achieve 100-110 reps with proper technique.\n\n### What's a good sandbag lunge time for HYROX?\n\nFor athletes targeting 1:30 finish times: men should aim for 4:30-5:30, women 4:00-5:00. The median times from our analysis were 5:18 (men) and 4:39 (women) for the 1:27-1:33 finish bracket.\n\n### Does going fast on sandbag lunges hurt my Run 8 performance?\n\nNo. Our analysis of 134 athletes shows near-zero correlation (r = -0.084 for men, -0.072 for women) between sandbag lunge speed and subsequent Run 8 time. Attack the lunges without fear.\n\n## The Competitive Advantage: Most Athletes Get This Wrong\n\nHere's what makes this analysis valuable:\n\n**most HYROX athletes haven't seen this data**.\n\nThey're still operating on the \"save legs for the run\" assumption. They're taking 140+ short steps. They're going conservative.\n\n**You now have a data-backed competitive edge:**\n\n- You know the correlation with Run 8 is zero (attack without fear)\n\n- You know step length matters more than most realize (practice 1m steps)\n\n- You know this is a high-variance station (big opportunity for time gain)\n\n- You know the wall ball connection (posterior chain emphasis pays double)\n\nWhen you execute this strategy correctly, you're gaining\n\n**30-90 seconds** on the majority of your age group simply by not making the mistakes they're making.\n\nThat's the difference between a podium and 10th place.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nThe sandbag lunges are where races are won or lost - not because they're the hardest station, but because most athletes\n\n**execute them incorrectly based on false assumptions**.\n\nGoing conservative to \"save legs\" for Run 8 is a myth unsupported by data. The correlation is near zero. What DOES matter:\n\n**Step length**(determines rep count and load distribution) **Technique**(posterior chain emphasis preserves quads for wall balls) **Aggression**(high variance = high reward for those who attack) **Specificity**(train weighted lunges under fatigue, not fresh) **Mental game**(embrace discomfort, trust the data)\n\nTrain it specifically. Practice 1m steps under fatigue. Dial in your technique. Build the mental fortitude to attack when everyone else is going soft.\n\nThen on race day, when your competitors are soft-pedaling through Station 7 trying to \"save something,\" you blow past them, bank 60 seconds, and trust the data: those legs will be there for Run 8.\n\nYour move.\n\n## Related Articles\n\nWant to optimize other aspects of your HYROX performance?\n\n- How to Improve Your HYROX Sled Push Time - Master the most feared station\n\n- The Hidden 3 Minutes - Optimize your transitions\n\n- Station Performance Analysis - Where to focus your training\n\n- HYROX Running Strategy - Run smart, not just fast\n\n**Planning your race strategy?** Use our HYROX Pacing Calculator to predict your finish time based on test data.\n\n*Data source: Analysis of athletes in the 1:27-1:33 finish bracket from HYROX Utrecht.

          "snippet": "The Farmer\u2019s Carry is the sixth station in a HYROX event. You need to complete a distance of 200m with the kettlebells in your hands.\n\nWhen you reach the Farmer\u2019s Carry station, you will have already have completed 6km of running and 5 functional stations (SkiErg, sled push, sled pull, burpee broad jumps and rowing).\n\nFollowing this station you have 2km of running and 2 remaining functional stations (Sandbag Lunges and Wall Balls).\n\nThis exercise engages your upper back and core. Good grip strength is required. You may place the kettlebells down without receiving a penalty.\n\nBelow is a video from HYROX outlining the Farmer\u2019s Carry and some training tips\u2026\n\n**HYROX Farmer\u2019s Carry Requirements (Weights and Distance)**\n\nThe Farmer\u2019s Carry requirements, by category, in HYROX are as follows:\n\nWomen: 200m with 2 x 16kg kettlebells\n\nWomen Pro: 200m with 2 x 24kg kettlebells\n\nMen: 200m with 2 x 24kg kettlebells\n\nMen Pro: 200m with 2 x 32kg kettlebells\n\nMixed Doubles: 200m with 2 x 24kg kettlebells\n\nWomen Doubles: 200m with 2 x 16kg kettlebells\n\nMen Doubles: 200m with 2 x 24kg kettlebells\n\nWomen Relay: 200m with 2 x 16kg kettlebells\n\nMen Relay: 200m with 2 x 24kg kettlebells\n\nMixed Relay: Female members 200m with 2 x 16kg kettlebells / Male members 200m with 2 x 24kg kettlebells\n\n**Completing the Farmer\u2019s Carry Station**\n\nThe station is completed when you cross the finish line and return the kettlebells to the marked area. The kettlebells must be placed back in their position with the handles up.\n\nWith many of the stations in HYROX, you should pace them a little so you have the energy to continue for the remainder of the race. My personal belief with the Farmers Carry, however, is that you should complete it as quickly as you possibly can. The longer you hold on to the kettlebells the more taxing it will be on you. You want to get the 200m done as quickly as possible, minimise the amount of time you need to put them down for (if you do at all), and get on with your race.\n\nTarget times:\n\nElite men: ~1:10 to 1:30\n\nElite women: ~1:20 to 1:40\n\nCompetitive age-groupers: ~1:30 to 2:30\n\nIf you are over 3 minutes, this station needs work.\n\n**Training for the Farmer\u2019s Carry**\n\nGrip strength is obviously a factor when it comes to the Farmers Carry in HYROX. Anything that challenges your grip is, in some way, preparing you for this station. Pull-ups, heavy holds, dead hangs and carries all help.\n\nThat said, a fast Farmers Carry time is not just about grip\u2026\n\nIn a conversation with Dr Adam Storey, exercise physiologist and HYROX Sports Science Advisory Council member, on the Rox Lyfe podcast, he said:\n\n*\u201cI would actually classify the farmer\u2019s carry as a postural endurance test. How long can you maintain good posture before things start to crumble?\u201d*\n\nThat changes how you should think about this station.\n\nWhen you watch athletes start to struggle in the Farmers Carry in HYROX, what usually happens first? The shoulders round forward, the upper back collapses, the chest drops, and the torso starts swaying.\n\nOnce posture goes, efficiency goes with it. Your metabolic cost rises, your grip starts to fatigue faster, and your speed drops.\n\nAdam explained that the trap complex plays a huge role here:\n\n\u2013 Upper traps help stabilise the shoulders under load\n\n\u2013 Mid traps maintain scapular retraction\n\n\u2013 Lower traps support thoracic extension\n\nIf you lose scapular control and your shoulders drift forward, your arms move into a weaker mechanical position. The kettlebells feel heavier. Energy leaks increase. Grip fatigue accelerates.\n\nIn other words, your hands might not be the weak link. Your posture might be.\n\nSo instead of only hammering dead hangs and heavy holds, you should also build:\n\n\u2013 Upper back strength\n\n\u2013 Posterior chain endurance\n\n\u2013 Core stability under load\n\n\u2013 The ability to maintain tall, efficient posture while moving\n\nThe fastest Farmers Carry athletes in HYROX do not just have strong hands. They look rock solid from shoulders to hips. No collapse. No wasted motion. That might, therefore, mean including exercises such as Romanian deadlifts, heavy shrugs, barbell rows, single-arm carries, and front rack carries in your training.\n\nThat does not mean specificity is irrelevant.\n\nYou still need to practise moving quickly with kettlebells in your hands. Farmers Carry is a skill under load. The more comfortable you are at race pace, the less it will spike your heart rate and disrupt your rhythm.\n\nOver time, build both:\n\n\u2022 Distance at race weight\n\n\u2022 Heavier carries over shorter distances\n\nFor example:\n\n\u2022 3 rounds of 150m at race weight\n\n\u2022 Or 3 rounds of 60 to 80m at a load above race weight\n\nFarmers Carry is often overlooked because there is always more running to do, more sled work to fit in, more wall balls to survive.\n\nBut it can shape how you enter the final stages of your HYROX race.\n\nAdam Storey described it as a hugely underrated exercise. If you want to improve your Farmers Carry in HYROX, it deserves deliberate training, not leftovers at the end of a session.\n\nShould you need any help with your training for the event, then you may be interested in our personalised coaching options, our 12 week HYROX training plan or our 12 Week Doubles plan.\n\n",

          "snippet": "On its surface, HYROX looks like a fairly straightforward fitness race: eight 1k runs mixed alongside eight unique workout stations. However, this simplicity can be misleading. If you show up unprepared, HYROX can punish you in very specific ways, and small mistakes can quickly add up!\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the 10 most common HYROX mistakes, and exactly how to avoid them so you can cross the finish line faster, stronger, and with enough left in the tank to actually enjoy it.\n\n## 1. Always training the runs and stations separately\n\n**Why it\u2019s a problem:** Plenty of newcomers train running and station work in isolation, logging miles one day and hitting the sled the next. But HYROX fatigue doesn\u2019t come from running alone or strength alone. It\u2019s the *cumulative effect* of switching between them over and over.\n\n**How to fix it:** Incorporate \u201ccompromised running\u201d into your training: run 500\u20131000m, then immediately hit a station movement (like sled push or wall balls), then run again. Variations like this condition your body to handle the heart rate spikes and muscle fatigue that make HYROX unique.\n\n## 2. Underestimating the run\n\n**Why it\u2019s a problem:** The stations get a lot of attention, but HYROX is still more of a running event than anything else. If your aerobic engine is underdeveloped, being really strong won\u2019t really help you that much.\n\n**How to fix it:** Spend at least 2-3 days per week building steady-state cardio at an easy pace, in addition to higher intensity interval sessions. This low-intensity work will help you build your aerobic base is that you can better sustain a steady pace between stations.\n\n## 3. Overestimating raw strength\n\n**Why it\u2019s a problem:** HYROX isn\u2019t a 1-rep max test\u2026 it\u2019s a grind. The sleds, lunges, and carries can feel heavy under fatigue, but are more designed to be moved *repeatedly* at sub-maximal effort. Having a massive squat 1-rep max won\u2019t save you if you can\u2019t push a sled for 50m without taking long breaks.\n\n**How to fix it:** Spend a lot of time training with race loads and distances. Focus on strength endurance: moderate weight, perfect form, and smaller rest periods.\n\n## 4. Mismanaging the sled push and pull\n\n**Why it\u2019s a problem:** The sled stations are where most athletes lose huge chunks of time, and it\u2019s not always about strength. Bad technique, poor footwear choice, and inefficient pacing can turn these into multi-minute disasters.\n\n**How to fix it:** Practice technique as much as raw effort: keep a low body position for the push, consistent grip for the pull. Use footwear with solid traction, and break the station into sustainable chunks instead of emptying the tank too early.\n\n## 5. Treating all stations equally\n\n**Why it\u2019s a problem:** Every HYROX station taxes the body differently: ski erg hits the upper body and lungs, lunges crush the quads and glutes, farmers carries light up the grip. If you attack them all with the same pacing and recovery strategy, you\u2019ll come away from the event with a much slower time than you could have.\n\n**How to fix it:** Identify your personal \u201cred zone\u201d stations, the ones that spike your heart rate or fatigue you fastest, and train them more often. Pairing them with runs to learn how to probably pace and recover from them while moving.\n\n## 6. Poor pacing in the runs\n\n**Why it\u2019s a problem:** The temptation to hammer the first run is strong (especially when adrenaline is high), but HYROX rewards steady effort, not hero splits. A fast first 1K often turns the final 3K into a death march.\n\n**How to fix it:** Train to run slightly slower than your 5K pace early in the race, with the goal of saving that energy for the last few runs. Use your watch or the in-venue clocks to keep yourself honest.\n\n## 7. Underestimating transition time (The Roxzone Effect)\n\n**Why it\u2019s a problem:** In HYROX, the **Roxzone** is the official designation for the transition area between the running course and each workout station. It\u2019s part of your official race time, but many of us treat it like a rest stop: walking slowly, grabbing extra drinks, or standing still to reset. Over eight stations, this can quietly add up to a ton of time without you realizing it.\n\n**How to fix it:** Treat the Roxzone like an extension of the race itself. Practice flowing from a run into a station without hesitation. In training, set up your stations so you have to run or walk briskly into them, keeping transitions under 10 seconds. Use this space to get mentally set, adjust your breathing, and grab quick hydration, but never stop moving forward.\n\n## 8. Not training under race-day fatigue\n\n**Why it\u2019s a problem:** You might nail wall balls in the gym fresh, but they feel completely different after 7K of running and seven stations. Same for burpee broad jumps when your hamstrings are fried.\n\n**How to fix it:** Do full-course simulations at least twice before race day. Even a half-distance simulation will give you a much better feel for pacing, fueling, and recovery.\n\n## 9. Improvising nutrition and hydration\n\n**Why it\u2019s a problem:** HYROX runs long enough (usually 90-150 minutes for beginners) that nutrition matters, but too many athletes wing it and suffer cramps, GI distress, or energy crashes.\n\n**How to fix it:** Test your fueling plan in training. If you plan to take in carbs mid-race, practice it during longer runs or longer HYROX workouts so your stomach knows what to expect.\n\n## 10. Focusing too much on the results\n\n**Why it\u2019s a problem:** HYROX is brutally honest about where your fitness is. Going into your first attempt, its is better to try and enjoy yourself, pace properly, and set an initial benchmark to try and beat in the future. Focusing too much on the results when you have never attempted it can make the event feel a lot more stressful than it needs to be.\n\n**How to fix it:** Treat your first race as a benchmark. Aim for clean movement standards, sustainable pacing, and execution over speed. Use the result to build a smarter plan for your second event.\n\n**Suggested articles:**\n\n",

We now have the bundles to meet all hybrid athletes' energy needs. Introducing the HYROX Performance Fuel Bundle and the Hybrid Hustle Bundle. These all-in-one training and race-day bundles are built for hybrid athletes who push the limits. Get more out of every session; more energy, sharper focus and greater endurance. Let\u2019s break down the science behind these ready-to-go fuel packs and what it takes for hybrid athletes to perform at their best on race day and in training.\n\n####\n\n**HYROX Energy Systems**\n\nHYROX is a unique sport that uses all 3 energy systems; ATP-PC system, Anaerobic glycolysis and the Aerobic system. Hence the nod to the \u2018hybrid\u2019 athlete. Let\u2019s dive deeper into what each system does.\n\n**ATP-PC System**\n\n\n\nDominant system during short, explosive efforts (e.g. sled push/pull, wall balls, burpee broad jumps).\n\n\n\nProvides energy for 0-10 seconds of max effort.\n\n**Anaerobic Glycolysis**\n\n\n\nPowers high-intensity efforts lasting 30 seconds to 2 minutes (e.g. rowing sprints, ski erg, farmers carry).\n\n\n\nProduces energy quickly but leads to lactate buildup and fatigue.\n\n**Aerobic System**\n\n\n\nKey for sustained work over the entire 60-90 min race.\n\n\n\nSupports running between stations and recovery from high-intensity bursts.\n\n\n\nUses carbohydrates and fats for energy depending on intensity.\n\n**Why a Good Nutrition Plan Matters for HYROX Performance**\n\nThe right nutrition plan is crucial for HYROX performance because it ensures you have sustained energy to power through high-intensity intervals and endurance components. Nutrition matters if you want to power every rep and crush every run. Let\u2019s talk sciency.\n\n\n\nAdequate carbohydrate intake before and during the race helps maintain blood glucose levels, delay fatigue, and support optimal muscle function (1).\n\n\n\nStrategic hydration and electrolyte balance prevent cramping and dehydration (2).\n\n\n\nProtein supports muscle repair and recovery between training sessions and post-race (3).\n\n\n\nA well-timed plan reduces gastrointestinal discomfort and helps you feel strong and focused throughout the race (4).\n\n**Nutrition Guide for HYROX Race Day and Training**\n\n**2 Hours Before Race Start**\n\n\n\nFuel- Eat a light meal around 2 hours before the race that contains some carbs and a bit of protein such as a few slices of toast with Nutella OR a bagel with cottage cheese and maple syrup\n\n\n\nHydration- Sip on 500-700ml of water with Dr. Hydrate All-In-One Hydration Drink for electrolytes and pre-hydration\n\n**20-30mins Before the Race**\n\n\n\nHave 1x Precision PF30 Energy Gel or Victus 02 During Gel. Consume your gel with 1 x scoop of ATP Science Pre+ or a sachet of Victus 01 with water.\n\n\n\nIt takes about 20-30 minutes for carbohydrates to hit your bloodstream, so timing it right means you'll get that energy boost right as the race begins (5,6).\n\n**During the Race**\n\n\n\nAfter Station 4 (burpee broad jumps), just before Run 5 have an optional 2nd Precision PF30 Energy Gel or Victus 02 During Gel to boost energy levels. Recommended is you are likely to finish closer to an hour and a half.\n\n\n\nTake on water at the Rox Zone if needed.\n\n**Post- Race**\n\n\n\nConsume a meal or a snack that contains 20-40g of high-quality protein with some carbs as close to finishing training as possible, preferable within 30-60 minutes (7,8).\n\n\n\nExample\u2192\n\nSmoothie with 1 sachet of Radix Nutrition Whey Protein DIAAS Complex\u2122 1.61 Sachet - Banana OR Victus 03 After\n\n+ 2 Tbsp of nut butter\n\n+ 1 medium banana\n\n+ 40g of rolled oats\n\n+ 100g frozen berries\n\n+ 200ml of unsweetened almond milk\n\n[ 645 Cal. 38g Pro. 22g Fat. 76g Carbs]\n\n\n\nWithin 4 hours of finishing your race or training have 1 scoop of Dr. Hydrate All-In-One Hydration Drink with water to replenish hydration stores as well as vitamins and minerals.\n\n####\n\n**What\u2019s the Difference Between the Bundles?**\n\nThe key difference between the bundles is that the HYROX Performance Fuel Bundle features products tested and certified by Informed Sport or HASTA, making it ideal for athletes concerned about drug testing or supplement safety. On the other hand, the Hybrid Hustle Bundle offers a more budget-friendly option while still delivering high-quality products from Victus who provide simple, clean nutrition backed by research and designed to deliver results.\n\n**Ash Miller**\n\nDietitian and Nutritionist (Masters)\n\nBachelor of Physical and Health Education\n\nInstagram: @ashthomo_nutrition\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThe content in this blog is for general information only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

          "text": "Now I have comprehensive data from multiple sources. Let me compile the final reference document.\n\n---\n\n# Comprehensive HYROX Coach Reference Document: Pacing Strategy & Race Execution\n\n---\n\n## 1. Pacing Strategy for HYROX\n\n### 1.1 Optimal Pacing for the 1 km Run Segments\n\n#### Should Athletes Negative Split, Even Split, or Positive Split?\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly favours **even pacing** as the gold-standard approach for HYROX. Analysis from the 2022 HYROX World Championships in Las Vegas shows that the **top 5 Elite finishers ran significantly more consistent splits** than the rest of the Elite field, and far more consistent than average Pro division competitors finishing around the 85-minute mark (Rox Lyfe, \"How to Pace Your Running at HYROX\"). The top performers also showed a **6-second or less difference** between their fastest and slowest 1 km run times across runs 2\u20137 (HyroxTrainingPlans.com).\n\nThe three core strategies break down as follows:\n\n| Strategy | Best For | Risk Level | Time Efficiency |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Negative Split** (start slow, finish fast) | First-time racers, cautious athletes | Low | Good \u2014 but leaves 1\u20133 min on the table |\n| **Even Pacing** (consistent effort throughout) | Experienced athletes targeting a specific time | Moderate (requires discipline) | Optimal for most athletes |\n| **Controlled Fast Start** (bank time early) | Elite/sub-1:15 men, sub-1:24 women | High | Fastest potential, but highest blow-up risk |\n\n**Recommendation for most athletes:** Even pacing. Athletes who pace evenly (within 10% variance across runs) finish **5\u201310% faster** than those who sprint early and fade late (HyroxDataLab). The data is unambiguous: consistent pacing isn't about holding back \u2014 it's about distributing effort optimally.\n\n#### How Does Pacing Change Across the 8 Runs?\n\nA subtle adjustment is expected even in \"even pacing\" strategies because of **cumulative fatigue**. Expect runs 5\u20138 to be **10\u201320 seconds/km slower** than runs 1\u20132, which is physiologically normal and should be planned for rather than fought against (HyroxDataLab Pacing Calculator Guide).\n\nKey nuances about specific run segments:\n\n- **Run 1:** The first run is often shorter or longer than 1 km due to the start line being in a different place from the RoxZone exit. At the 2022 World Championships, **the top 5 Elite finishers went out relatively slower** on the first run compared to the rest of the Elite field, who in turn went out slower than the average Pro competitor. The athletes with the slowest overall times tended to go out the fastest on Run 1 (Rox Lyfe). Start 5\u201310 seconds/km slower than your target pace on Run 1.\n- **Runs 2\u20134:** Settle into target pace. This is the \"find your rhythm\" zone. Resist the urge to speed up because you feel good \u2014 this is glycogen you'll desperately need later.\n- **Runs 5\u20137:** The grind. Allow a natural 10\u201315 sec/km slowdown. Don't panic if your pace drops slightly \u2014 this is expected. What matters is **consistent effort**, not consistent pace.\n- **Run 8:** The final run often feels longer because it includes extra distance to reach the wall ball station. Manage expectations accordingly. If you've paced well, you may have enough to push slightly harder here, but the priority is arriving at wall balls with enough in the tank for 75\u2013100 reps.\n\n#### Target Run Paces by Goal Finish Time\n\n| Goal Finish Time | Avg Run Pace (per km) | Avg Station Time Budget (all 8) | Total RoxZone Budget |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **2:00:00** (Beginner) | 6:15\u20136:30/km | ~52:00 (avg ~6:30/station) | ~11:00 |\n| **1:45:00** (Intermediate-) | 5:30\u20135:45/km | ~44:00 (avg ~5:30/station) | ~10:00 |\n| **1:30:00** (Intermediate+) | 5:00\u20135:25/km | ~37:00 (avg ~4:40/station) | ~9:00 |\n| **1:15:00** (Advanced) | 4:30\u20134:45/km | ~29:00 (avg ~3:40/station) | ~7:00 |\n| **1:10:00** (Elite) | 4:15\u20134:30/km | ~27:30 (avg ~3:25/station) | ~5:00 |\n\n*Sources: HyroxDataLab Pacing Calculator, HyroxTrainingPlans.com, Rox Lyfe*\n\n**How to determine your individual pace:** Run 1 km at approximately 85% of your max heart rate on a track. The time you record is a rough proxy for your per-km target at HYROX. Alternatively, your HYROX run pace will typically align with your **half-marathon or marathon pace** \u2014 not your 5K pace. Most athletes' HYROX run splits are significantly slower than their 10K race pace due to the accumulated fatigue from stations (Rox Lyfe).\n\n---\n\n### 1.2 Heart Rate Zone Management Across the Entire Race\n\n#### Target HR Zones: Runs vs Stations vs Transitions\n\nHeart rate management is critical because HYROX forces constant toggling between aerobic (running) and anaerobic (station) efforts over 60\u2013150 minutes. One data point from Precision Hydration: an athlete completing HYROX in 70 minutes had an **average heart rate of 154 bpm \u2014 96% of max HR**. That's the equivalent sustained effort of a half marathon.\n\n| Race Phase | Target HR Zone | % Max HR | Perceived Effort |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Runs 1\u20133** | Zone 3 (High Aerobic) | 70\u201378% | Conversational to moderately hard; can speak in short sentences |\n| **Runs 4\u20136** | Zone 3\u20134 (Tempo/Threshold) | 75\u201385% | Uncomfortable but controlled; sentences become difficult |\n| **Runs 7\u20138** | Zone 4 (Threshold) | 80\u201388% | Hard; racing effort, fuelled by remaining reserves |\n| **Stations (SkiErg, Row)** | Zone 4 (Threshold) | 80\u201388% | Controlled intensity, not maximal |\n| **Stations (Sled Push/Pull)** | Zone 4\u20135 (Threshold\u2013VO2max) | 85\u201392% | Near-max leg effort; expect HR spike |\n| **Stations (Burpees, Lunges, Wall Balls)** | Zone 4 (Threshold) | 80\u201390% | Sustained muscular endurance |\n| **Farmers Carry** | Zone 3\u20134 | 78\u201385% | Brisk walk; grip and posture challenge more than cardiovascular |\n| **RoxZone Transitions** | Zone 2\u20133 (Recovery/Aerobic) | 65\u201375% | Active recovery; jog lightly, don't walk or stand still |\n\n*Sources: HyroxTrainingPlans.com, Box Nutrition, Bend and Mend Physiotherapy*\n\n#### How HR Drift Affects Pacing in the Second Half\n\n**Cardiac drift** \u2014 the gradual upward creep of heart rate at the same pace \u2014 is inevitable over 60\u2013150 minutes of sustained effort. As core temperature rises, plasma volume decreases (from sweating), and glycogen stores deplete, the heart must beat faster to deliver the same cardiac output.\n\nPractical implications:\n- **By run 5\u20136**, the same pace that kept you at 75% max HR in run 1 may now produce 82\u201385% max HR. This is normal.\n- **Don't chase the same HR numbers** in the second half. Instead, shift to monitoring **perceived effort** and **pace**. If your pace is within 10\u201320 sec/km of your early splits and you feel \"controlled hard,\" you're on track.\n- **If HR exceeds 90\u201392% max for sustained periods** during runs in the second half, you need to slow down. Continuing at that intensity will cause a dramatic fade and potentially compromise your ability to complete stations.\n- **Dehydration accelerates drift.** Every 1% loss in bodyweight from sweat can increase HR by 5\u20138 bpm. This is why hydration strategy matters enormously (see Section 2.4).\n\n#### HR Ceiling to Avoid Early in the Race\n\nThe single most important HR rule for HYROX: **do not exceed 85% of max HR during the first three run segments**. Going above this threshold in the early stages depletes glycogen disproportionately fast, spikes lactate accumulation, and accelerates core temperature rise \u2014 all of which compound exponentially in the second half (HyroxTrainingPlans.com, Bend and Mend Physiotherapy).\n\nThink of it as a **\"spending budget.\"** The aerobic energy you save in runs 1\u20133 by staying at 70\u201378% max HR is the exact energy you'll need to maintain technique during wall balls and push through runs 7\u20138.\n\n---\n\n### 1.3 Station-Specific Pacing\n\n#### SkiErg (1,000 m)\n\nThe SkiErg is Station 1 \u2014 the very first functional exercise after Run 1. The temptation to blast it (fresh legs, adrenaline) is real, but the risk/reward is poor. Analysis shows the SkiErg has one of the **lowest time variances** across finish-time brackets \u2014 only about 22 seconds separating a 1:20 finisher from a 1:40 finisher (HyroxDataLab). Meaning: going 15 seconds faster here by redlining your effort costs far more energy than the time it saves.\n\n| Metric | Beginner (2:00 goal) | Intermediate (1:30 goal) | Elite (1:10 goal) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Target /500m split | 2:45\u20133:00 | 2:05\u20132:15 | 1:50\u20131:55 |\n| Stroke rate | 35\u201340 spm | 40\u201350 spm | 48\u201355 spm |\n| Total station time | ~6:00 | ~4:30 | ~3:50 |\n\n**Pacing breakdown:**\n- **First 200 m:** 60\u201370% effort. Establish rhythm and breathing pattern. Do not sprint (RMR Training, Centr/Meg Jacobi).\n- **Middle 600 m:** Lock into target pace. Maintain stroke rate at 45\u201355 spm. This should feel like your **5K running effort** \u2014 strong but controlled (RMR Training, James Hall).\n- **Final 200 m:** Increase effort only if sustainable. Prepare mentally for the transition to Run 2.\n\n**Key coaching cue:** \"Sacrificing a few seconds on your overall ski time will yield a better run afterward \u2014 where there is more to gain. Risk to reward!\" \u2014 Meg Jacobi, HYROX athlete (Centr).\n\n**Technique note:** Drive power from the legs and core, not just the arms. Hinge at the hips, engage the lats, and pull through with full extension. Arm-dominant athletes will burn out their shoulders \u2014 which they need for sled pull, rowing, and wall balls later.\n\n#### Sled Push (4 \u00d7 12.5 m lengths)\n\nThe sled push is Station 2, and it is **where more races are lost than any other station**. At the 2023 North American Championships, many elite male competitors reportedly destroyed their race by going too fast on the sled push (Rox Lyfe). The problem is physics: once you stop the sled, static friction is **3\u20135 times greater** than kinetic friction, meaning restarting costs enormously more energy than keeping the sled crawling forward (HyroxTrainingPlans.com).\n\n| Metric | Beginner (2:00 goal) | Intermediate (1:30 goal) | Elite (1:10 goal) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Total station time | ~5:00 | ~3:30 | ~2:30 |\n| Strategy | Stop-and-go with 3\u20135 sec rests | Continuous with minor slow-downs | Continuous, aggressive |\n\n**Continuous vs stop-and-go:**\n- **Continuous (recommended for intermediate+):** Never let the sled fully stop. If you need to \"rest,\" slow to a crawl but keep the sled moving. Even 1\u20132 inches per second of movement is better than zero. This avoids the massive energy cost of breaking static friction every time you restart.\n- **Stop-and-go (acceptable for beginners):** If you must stop, keep rests to **3\u20135 seconds maximum** (Rezerv.co). Stop approximately **5 steps before your legs start burning** \u2014 lactic acid clearance is exponential, so the more you accumulate, the longer recovery takes (Women's Health/HYROX coach advice).\n\n**Technique essentials:**\n- Keep body low \u2014 45-degree angle between torso and ground.\n- Use short, choppy steps: **6\u20138 inch steps, 120+ steps per minute cadence** (HyroxTrainingPlans.com). Long strides create a stop-start pattern.\n- First 3 steps of each length: MAX effort to break static friction.\n- Breathe rhythmically: exhale every 2\u20133 steps.\n- Arms: extended (for leverage) or slightly bent \u2014 experiment in training.\n\n**Post-sled recovery:** Take 5 deep breaths with hands on knees. Shake out quads before transitioning. The run immediately after sled push (Run 3) is where you'll feel the worst. Expect it. Accept a 10\u201315 sec/km pace drop.\n\n#### Sled Pull (Hand-Over-Hand)\n\nThe sled pull is Station 3. It's less about brute strength and more about **minimising dead time between pulls**.\n\n**Pacing strategy:**\n- Run (don't walk) to the far end of the lane to set up.\n- Sit or brace your feet, lean back, and begin pulling hand-over-hand with steady, rhythmic pulls.\n- **Minimise rest between rope grabs.** Most time lost at sled pull is from athletes taking long pauses between pulls of the rope and walking slowly between lengths (Rox Lyfe).\n- Keep a consistent rhythm: think of it like climbing a rope \u2014 one hand immediately follows the other.\n- Once the sled reaches you, stand up quickly, run (don't walk) back to the start, and begin again.\n\n| Metric | Beginner (2:00 goal) | Intermediate (1:30 goal) | Elite (1:10 goal) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Total station time | ~6:00 | ~4:00 | ~3:00 |\n\n**Key coaching cue:** \"Hustle on sled pull. You can push yourself a little more here without compromising yourself for the rest of the race\" (Rox Lyfe). Chalk your hands beforehand \u2014 grip failure means dropped ropes and wasted time.\n\n#### Burpee Broad Jumps (80 m)\n\nStation 4. This is the most metabolically brutal station \u2014 it combines a full-body power movement (burpee) with explosive horizontal displacement (broad jump). The station typically takes **3\u20136 minutes** depending on fitness level (HyroxTrainingPlans.com).\n\n**Rep tempo and pacing:**\n- **Conservative pacing (recommended):** Start at 70\u201380% max intensity. Find a rhythm and maintain **consistent jump distance** throughout. Do NOT sprint the first 20m and limp the last 60m.\n- **Target rep tempo:** Aim for one complete burpee broad jump every **3.5\u20135 seconds** depending on your level.\n- **When to slow down vs push:** If your jump distance drops below ~1.2m (indicating muscular failure), slow your tempo slightly rather than attempting explosive jumps that cover no distance. Maintaining consistent distance per jump is more efficient than variable bursts.\n- **Break strategy:** Unlike wall balls, burpee broad jumps don't lend themselves well to formal \"break sets.\" Instead, maintain a steady rhythm. If you must pause, take **2\u20133 breaths standing** then resume \u2014 do NOT sit or lie down (George Anderson's \"Get Out of the Chair\" principle from Rox Lyfe).\n\n**Key coaching cue:** \"Avoid the burst-and-pause approach. Instead, find a steady pace you can maintain\" (Women's Health).\n\n#### Rowing (1,000 m)\n\nStation 5. The row comes at the midpoint of the race, after the devastating burpee broad jumps. Your heart rate will be elevated; your goal is to use the rower as a **controlled reset**, not another sprint.\n\n| Metric | Beginner (2:00 goal) | Intermediate (1:30 goal) | Elite (1:10 goal) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Target /500m split | 2:30\u20132:45 | 2:05\u20132:20 | 1:50\u20131:55 |\n| Stroke rate | 22\u201326 spm | 24\u201328 spm | 26\u201330 spm |\n| Total station time | ~6:00 | ~4:45 | ~3:50 |\n\n**Pacing formula:** Your HYROX row pace should be approximately **your 2K rowing time trial pace + 10 seconds per 500m** (RMR Training/James Hall). This feels \"strong but controlled\" \u2014 not like you're hunting a PR.\n\n**Technical emphasis:**\n- **Power through the legs** (70% leg drive, 20% back, 10% arms). Arm-dominant rowing is inefficient and will fatigue your biceps and grip for farmers carry later.\n- **Keep stroke rate steady at 24\u201328 spm.** Avoid fluctuations \u2014 each surge and recovery wastes energy.\n- **Monitor the /500m split display** and aim for consistency from the first stroke to the last.\n\nThe rowing station, like the SkiErg, has **very low time variance** across finish-time brackets (~28 seconds; HyroxDataLab). Going 10 seconds faster by sprinting is not worth the energy it costs.\n\n#### Farmers Carry (200 m)\n\nStation 6. This station is unique in that **you should go as fast as humanly possible** (Rox Lyfe, \"Full Send Farmers\"). Here's why: grip endurance is the limiting factor, and the longer you hold the kettlebells, the worse it gets. Speed reduces total time under load.\n\n| Metric | Beginner (2:00 goal) | Intermediate (1:30 goal) | Elite (1:10 goal) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Total station time | ~4:00 | ~2:30 | ~1:10\u20131:30 |\n| Pace | Brisk walk, 1\u20132 stops | Fast walk, 0\u20131 stops | Near-jog, unbroken |\n\n**Walk pace:** Move at the fastest sustainable walk (or light jog) you can manage. Think \"power walk\" \u2014 upright posture, arms locked, short quick steps.\n\n**Grip management:**\n- **Chalk your hands** before starting \u2014 sweaty palms are the #1 cause of dropped kettlebells (Rox Lyfe).\n- Maintain **tall posture**: shoulders packed, chest up, core braced. Dr. Adam Storey (HYROX Sports Science Advisory Council) classifies the farmers carry as a **\"postural endurance test\"** \u2014 the athlete who maintains upright posture the longest maintains their speed the longest (Rox Lyfe Farmers Carry Guide).\n- **When to set down:** Only if you physically cannot hold on. Every stop costs ~5\u201310 seconds (setting down + shaking out + picking up + re-gripping). Aim for 0 stops if targeting sub-1:30, 0\u20131 stops if targeting sub-2:00.\n- There is **no penalty for setting the kettlebells down** (unlike the sandbag in lunges), but every stop kills your time.\n\n**Coaching cue:** \"You don't really need much grip strength for the rest of the race. So going all out on the farmers is worthwhile.\" (Rox Lyfe).\n\n#### Sandbag Lunges (100 m)\n\nStation 7. Data from HyroxDataLab's analysis of HYROX Utrecht shows that sandbag lunges are a **high-leverage station** with massive time variance (87\u201388 seconds across finish-time brackets) but **near-zero correlation with Run 8 performance** (r = -0.084 for men, -0.072 for women). This demolishes the common \"save legs for the final run\" myth.\n\n**Step tempo:**\n- Target **0.9\u20131.1 m step length** (100\u2013110 total steps for men, 110\u2013120 for women).\n- Longer steps shift load from quads \u2192 glutes/hamstrings, which **preserves quads for wall balls** (the very next station, where correlation is strong: r = 0.738).\n- **Constant movement** \u2014 touch-and-go on the back knee. Do not pause at the bottom of each rep.\n- Step cadence: approximately one lunge every 2.5\u20133.5 seconds.\n\n**Breathing pattern:** Exhale forcefully on the drive up (concentric phase), inhale at the bottom (eccentric phase). Keep breathing rhythmic and tied to movement.\n\n| Metric | Beginner (2:00 goal) | Intermediate (1:30 goal) | Elite (1:10 goal) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Total station time | ~8:00 | ~5:00\u20135:30 | ~3:30\u20134:15 |\n| Step count target | 130\u2013150 | 100\u2013120 | 90\u2013105 |\n\n**Coaching cue:** \"Attack the sandbag lunges aggressively. The time you lose going slow hurts your finish time directly, while the theoretical fatigue you're avoiding doesn't materially impact your final run.\" (HyroxDataLab).\n\n#### Wall Balls (75 reps women / 100 reps men)\n\nStation 8 \u2014 the final functional station. You're exhausted, your quads are wrecked from lunges, and you have 75\u2013100 reps between you and the finish line. **A break strategy is essential.**\n\n**Break strategies:**\n\n| Strategy | Reps Pattern | Rest Between Sets | Best For |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Aggressive (Unbroken) | 100 straight | None | Elite athletes with exceptional fitness |\n| Semi-Aggressive | 25-25-25-25 or 30-30-25-15 | 3\u20135 sec | Strong intermediate athletes |\n| Conservative | 20-20-20-20-20 | 3\u20135 sec | Most athletes \u2014 **recommended** |\n| Very Conservative | 15-15-15-15-15-10-15 | 5\u20138 sec | Beginners or athletes with poor upper body endurance |\n\n**Rep tempo:** Each wall ball rep should take approximately **2.5\u20133.5 seconds** (catch \u2192 squat \u2192 drive \u2192 release \u2192 catch). Find a metronome-like rhythm and lock in.\n\n**Key coaching cue:** \"If you start off by doing as many as you can (say you manage 40 unbroken) but that leaves your shoulders completely fried and massively slows you down for the remainder, then you didn't pace appropriately. It's possible you should have just done 25 and had a very short pause before carrying on.\" (Rox Lyfe).\n\n**Technique under fatigue:** Keep feet planted, use **legs** (not arms/shoulders) to generate upward force. If the ball starts hitting below the target line, you're burning out \u2014 take a micro-break rather than accumulating no-reps from the judge.\n\n---\n\n### 1.4 When to Push vs Conserve: Station Reward Analysis\n\nNot all stations reward aggressive pacing equally. Based on data analysis from HyroxDataLab and coaching literature:\n\n| Station | Variance Across Finish Brackets | Push or Conserve? | Reasoning |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **SkiErg** | Low (22 sec) | **Conserve** \u2014 controlled, 70\u201380% effort | Minimal time gain from going harder; high energy cost |\n| **Sled Push** | Moderate-High | **Conserve** \u2014 steady, never stop | Lactic acid from over-pushing destroys subsequent runs |\n| **Sled Pull** | Moderate | **Moderate push** \u2014 hustle between pulls | Dead time (walking, resting) is the biggest time sink |\n| **Burpee Broad Jumps** | High (107 sec) | **Steady push** \u2014 consistent tempo | Burst-and-pause approach is worse than sustained rhythm |\n| **Rowing** | Low (28 sec) | **Conserve** \u2014 strong but controlled | Same as SkiErg; diminishing returns from extra effort |\n| **Farmers Carry** | Low (26 sec) | **Full send** \u2014 go as fast as possible | Speed reduces time under load; grip doesn't matter after |\n| **Sandbag Lunges** | High (87\u201388 sec) | **Attack aggressively** | Near-zero correlation with Run 8; huge time-gain opportunity |\n| **Wall Balls** | Highest (146 sec) | **Controlled push** \u2014 smart break strategy | Highest variance = biggest training/execution payoff |\n\n**Summary principle:** Conserve on the machines (SkiErg, Row) where extra effort yields minimal time savings but massive energy cost. Attack the high-variance bodyweight/loaded stations (lunges, wall balls, burpees) where execution and fitness translate directly into large time gains.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Common Mistakes & Race Execution\n\n### 2.1 Most Common Training Mistakes in HYROX Preparation\n\n#### Neglecting Running Volume\n\nHYROX is **50% running** (8 km total), yet many gym-goers disproportionately focus on station work. As Gymshark's HYROX training guide bluntly states: \"Train like you are training for a half marathon, and as long as you can do the movements, you can't go wrong.\" If you can't comfortably run 8 km, no amount of sled push strength will save you (Gymshark, Connect the Watts).\n\n**The fix:** Run 2\u20133 days per week minimum. Include one long easy run (Zone 2, 45\u201360 min), one tempo/threshold run (Zone 4, 20\u201330 min), and one interval session. Build to ~25\u201335 km/week if targeting sub-1:30 (Rox Lyfe, Connect the Watts).\n\n#### Over-Focusing on Strength at the Expense of Endurance\n\nHYROX is not a 1-rep max test. The sled weighs 152 kg (men) or 102 kg (women) and must be pushed repeatedly, not once. A massive squat won't help if you can't push the sled for 50 m without extended breaks (Connect the Watts).\n\n**The fix:** Train **strength-endurance**: moderate loads, higher reps (12\u201320), shorter rest periods (60\u201390 sec). Use race-weight loads in training regularly. If you can deadlift 200 kg but can't push the race sled without stopping 6 times, your training is misaligned.\n\n#### Not Practicing Transitions\n\nThe RoxZone (transition area) can account for **5\u201311 minutes** of total race time. Every second wasted walking, standing, or lingering at water stations adds up across 8 transitions. Many athletes unknowingly add 2\u20134 minutes by treating transitions as rest periods (Rox Lyfe, Connect the Watts).\n\n**The fix:** In training, set up stations so you must run/walk briskly into them. Practice flowing from a run directly into station work without hesitation. Aim for RoxZone times of **under 1:00\u20131:15 per transition** for intermediate athletes and **under 45 seconds** for advanced (HyroxDataLab).\n\n#### Not Doing Full Simulations\n\nThe standardised format of HYROX makes it tempting to simulate the full race frequently \u2014 but doing full simulations too often risks overtraining and injury. Conversely, **never** doing one means you won't know how station-to-station fatigue compounds (Rox Lyfe, 3in1Sports).\n\n**The fix:** Complete **1\u20132 full HYROX simulations** (or scaled half-simulations) in the 6\u20138 weeks before your race. These should be at race pace. \"A realistic HYROX plan is not just a thought experiment \u2014 it's a plan you *test*\" (3in1Sports). Beyond that, train station-specific work in smaller, targeted blocks with progressive overload.\n\n---\n\n### 2.2 Most Common Race-Day Execution Errors\n\n#### Going Out Too Fast on Run 1\n\nThis is the **single most common mistake** in HYROX. Adrenaline, crowd energy, and 50 other athletes sprinting beside you create an irresistible urge to hammer the first kilometre. The data from the 2022 World Championships shows that **slower overall finishers went out relatively faster on Run 1**, while the fastest finishers were deliberately conservative at the start (Rox Lyfe).\n\n**The fix:** Write your target Run 1 split on your wrist. Use a GPS watch with a lap timer. Trust the data, not the feeling. \"Consistent pacing will almost certainly mean deliberately slowing yourself towards the start of the race. You will likely feel like you could be going faster \u2014 and many athletes around you *will* be going faster. This can be mentally challenging.\" (Rox Lyfe).\n\n#### Poor Sled Technique Wasting Energy\n\nBad technique \u2014 high body angle, long strides, and full stops between lengths \u2014 can cost **60\u2013120 seconds** and leave your quads destroyed for subsequent runs. Many athletes treat the sled push like a sprint rather than a sustained grind (Connect the Watts, HyroxTrainingPlans.com).\n\n**The fix:** Keep body at a 45-degree angle, use short choppy steps (120+ cadence), and **never let the sled fully stop**. Static friction requires 3\u20135x more force to overcome than kinetic friction. Slow to a crawl if you must, but keep the sled moving (HyroxTrainingPlans.com).\n\n#### Not Having a Wall Ball Break Strategy\n\nGoing for an unbroken set of 75\u2013100 wall balls when you haven't trained for it leads to complete muscular failure around rep 35\u201345, followed by agonisingly long rests and a total time that's **worse** than if you'd planned breaks from the start (Rox Lyfe).\n\n**The fix:** Determine your break strategy in training. For most athletes, **sets of 20\u201325 with 3\u20135 second rests** is optimal. Commit to this plan regardless of how you feel at the start of the station.\n\n#### Ignoring Nutrition and Hydration\n\nHYROX typically lasts 60\u2013150 minutes at near-maximal sustained effort. Studies show that 40\u201350% of recreational athletes begin exercise in a **mildly dehydrated state** (Precision Hydration). Starting under-fuelled means glycogen depletion kicks in around Station 4\u20135, causing dramatic power output drops and cognitive decline.\n\n**The fix:** See Section 2.4 below for a complete fuelling protocol.\n\n---\n\n### 2.3 Race-Day Nutrition and Hydration\n\n#### Pre-Race Meal Timing and Composition\n\n| Timing | What to Eat | Quantity |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Day before** | Carb-loading: aim for 8 g carbs/kg bodyweight | E.g., 640 g carbs for an 80 kg athlete |\n| **Night before** | Preload hydration: strong electrolyte drink (1500 mg sodium) + 500 ml water | 1 serving |\n| **2\u20133 hours before** | High-carb, low-fibre, low-fat meal (toast, rice, porridge, bagel) | ~100\u2013150 g carbs |\n| **1\u20132 hours before** | Carb-rich snack (energy bar, rice cake, banana) | ~30\u201350 g carbs |\n| **90 minutes before** | Electrolyte preload: 1500 mg sodium + 500 ml water | 1 serving |\n| **20\u201330 minutes before** | Caffeine gel or chew (if tolerated; 3\u20136 mg/kg caffeine) | 1 gel (~30 g carbs) |\n\n*Sources: Precision Hydration, AidStation/Ash Miller (Dietitian), StartHyrox*\n\n**Critical rule:** Never try new nutrition on race day. Test everything \u2014 gels, electrolytes, pre-race meals \u2014 during training sessions first. Energy gels cause GI distress in some people, and discovering this mid-race is catastrophic (Rox Lyfe).\n\n#### During-Race Fuelling\n\n| Race Duration | Fuelling Protocol |\n|---|---|\n| **Under 75 min** | Pre-race fuelling should carry you through. Carry 1 gel for a mid-race boost if needed. Sip water at RoxZone stations. |\n| **75 min \u2013 2 hours** | Aim for **30\u201360 g carbs per hour** via gels or chews. Take them during RoxZone transitions or less intense moments (e.g., after farmers carry). Carry a 500 ml soft flask with electrolytes. |\n| **Over 2 hours** | Aim for **30\u201360 g carbs per hour.** Plan 2\u20133 gels across the race. Carry electrolyte flask. Take additional fluid at every water station. |\n\n**Timing tip:** A good moment for a mid-race gel is **after Station 4 (burpee broad jumps), just before Run 5** \u2014 you're at the halfway point, and the carbohydrates will take ~20\u201330 minutes to hit your bloodstream, providing a boost precisely when the second-half grind begins (AidStation).\n\n#### What to Consume at Water Stations\n\nThe RoxZone water stations are your only opportunity for mid-race hydration. Take **small sips** \u2014 100\u2013200 ml maximum \u2014 to manage thirst without causing sloshing or GI discomfort. If carrying a soft flask with electrolytes, take a larger sip from that. Do not stop moving while drinking. Walk briskly or jog while sipping (Precision Hydration, Rox Lyfe).\n\n---\n\n### 2.4 Warm-Up Protocols\n\n#### Timing\n\n| Event | Timing |\n|---|---|\n| Arrive at venue | 60\u201390 minutes before wave start |\n| Begin warm-up | 30\u201345 minutes before wave start |\n| Complete warm-up | 5\u201310 minutes before wave start |\n| Total warm-up duration | 12\u201320 minutes of active work |\n\n*Sources: RMR Training, BLDRSports, DocLyss Fitness*\n\n#### Specific Warm-Up Routine\n\n**Phase 1: Aerobic Activation (7\u201310 minutes, starting ~45 min out)**\n- Light jog, bike, or row at easy effort (Zone 1\u20132)\n- Goal: raise core temperature, activate aerobic system\n- Don't worry if you feel sluggish \u2014 pre-race jitters are normal (RMR Training)\n\n**Phase 2: Intensity Ramp (5\u20138 minutes, starting ~30 min out)**\n- Run 3 minutes at marathon pace\n- 500 m SkiErg at target race pace (your 2K pace + 5\u20137 seconds)\n- Or 3\u20134 rounds of: 1 min run + 1 min SkiErg/Row + 1 min bike (RMR Training)\n- Goal: elevate HR to race-ready levels without depleting energy\n\n**Phase 3: Mobility and Station-Specific Drills (5\u201310 minutes, starting ~15 min out)**\n- Hip flexors and quads (running, lunges)\n- Shoulders and lats (SkiErg, rowing, wall balls)\n- Ankles and calves (running, jumping)\n- Practice light reps: push sled 10 m, 3\u20135 burpee broad jumps, carry farmer handles 10\u201315 m, 5\u201310 wall balls\n- Goal: coordination and confidence, not fatigue (RMR Training, BLDRSports)\n\n**Phase 4: Final Priming (3\u20135 minutes, starting ~10 min out)**\n- 2\u20133 \u00d7 20\u201330 second race-pace pickups with walking recovery\n- 4\u20136 \u00d7 100 m strides at ~800 m pace (RMR Training)\n- This primes the nervous system and makes Run 1 feel familiar\n- Put on race shoes and test with a few strides\n\n**Phase 5: Mental Reset (final 2\u20133 minutes)**\n- Deep breathing exercises\n- Visualise your first 3 stations\n- Review pacing plan (written on wrist or arm)\n- Find your mantra or focus word\n\n*Sources: RMR Training, BLDRSports, DocLyss Fitness*\n\n#### Common Warm-Up Mistakes\n\n- **Skipping it entirely** \u2014 leaves you sluggish through Run 1 and SkiErg\n- **Overdoing it** \u2014 a 30-minute high-intensity warm-up depletes energy you need for the race\n- **Trying new movements** \u2014 the warm-up is for activation, not experimentation\n- **Letting the warm-up dictate expectations** \u2014 how you feel warming up often does not predict race performance (RMR Training)\n\n---\n\n### 2.5 Mental Models Used by Top Competitors\n\n#### \"Station + Next Run = One Unit\" Mindset\n\nRather than thinking of HYROX as 16 individual segments (8 runs + 8 stations), elite competitors chunk the race into **8 units**, each consisting of one station and the subsequent run. This reframing reduces the cognitive load of \"16 things to get through\" to \"8 blocks, one at a time.\"\n\nWithin each unit, the station is the work and the run is the recovery. This prevents the demoralising feeling of finishing a brutal station only to face \"another run.\" Instead, the run is part of the same block \u2014 your body's chance to flush lactate and reset before the next block begins.\n\n#### Process Goals vs Outcome Goals\n\nTop competitors focus on **process goals** during the race rather than outcome goals:\n\n- \u274c Outcome goal: \"I need to finish in 1:28\"\n- \u2705 Process goal: \"Hit 5:15 on this kilometre\" or \"Do 25 wall balls, then break\"\n\nProcess goals keep you focused on the controllable present moment. Outcome goals create anxiety about the future and tempt you to make irrational mid-race decisions (like sprinting Run 3 to \"bank time\").\n\n**Framework for setting race-day process goals:**\n1. Write target splits for each segment on your wrist band\n2. At the start of each segment, state your goal: \"This run is 5:20\"\n3. At the end of each segment, assess: \"Did I hit it? If not, what's the adjustment?\"\n4. Move on. Don't carry frustration from one segment to the next.\n\n#### Self-Talk Strategies\n\nGeorge Anderson (well-being and performance coach featured on Rox Lyfe) recommends several self-talk frameworks:\n\n- **\"Get Out of the Chair\":** When overwhelmed by what's ahead (80 m of burpee broad jumps, for example), don't think about the full distance. Just focus on doing the first rep. Then the next. \"Get that first burpee done rather than dwelling on 80 metres of them.\" This short-term focus keeps you present and moving (Rox Lyfe/George Anderson).\n\n- **\"Embrace the Suck\":** Reframe pain as a signal that you're giving 5\u201310% more, not that something is wrong. \"Those feelings of pain and exertion can be quite unnerving if you aren't used to it. When you instead see them as signals that you're giving another 5\u201310%, and that it's not going to get any worse, and you just need to sustain this for a short period of time, that does something quite fundamental to your motivation.\" (George Anderson, Rox Lyfe).\n\n- **\"Through the Line\":** Never ease up before a segment is complete. Always push through the finish of each station and each run. \"Don't lose that last little bit of performance which could make it or break it.\" (George Anderson, Rox Lyfe).\n\n- **Aggressive vs Passive Self-Talk:** Research on self-talk in endurance sport suggests that **instructional** (\"Drive your knees\") and **motivational** (\"Let's go!\") cues are more effective than reassuring cues (\"I can do this\"). Use commanding, action-oriented language.\n\n#### Managing the Pain Cave in Runs 5\u20138\n\nRuns 5 through 8 are where HYROX becomes a mental battle. Cumulative fatigue, glycogen depletion, and HR drift converge to make every step feel harder. Here's the mental framework used by top competitors:\n\n1. **Break the remaining race into shrinking chunks:** After Run 5, you have \"only 3 stations left.\" After Run 6, \"only 2.\" This creates a sense of acceleration even as your body is decelerating.\n\n2. **Use external focus:** Count laps, watch other athletes, engage with the crowd. Internal focus (\"my legs hurt\") amplifies perceived effort. External focus (\"I need to pass that person ahead\") reduces it.\n\n3. **Reframe the suffering:** As Liz Yelling (world-class distance runner) explained to George Anderson: \"What sets the top performers apart is their willingness to suffer \u2014 their ability to embrace discomfort and simply endure more pain than others.\" The athletes around you are suffering equally. The question is: who keeps moving?\n\n4. **Nutritional intervention:** If you haven't already taken your mid-race gel, Run 5 is the time. The psychological effect of \"I just took fuel, I'll feel better in 10 minutes\" is almost as powerful as the actual carbohydrate boost.\n\n5. **Station countdown:** After every station in the second half, mentally cross it off. \"Rowing is done. I will never row again today. Three to go.\" This is especially powerful after the farmers carry (Station 6), where you can remind yourself: \"Only lunges and wall balls stand between me and the finish.\"\n\n6. **Mantras:** Simple, repeatable phrases work best under extreme fatigue when complex thought breaks down. Examples used by competitors:\n   - \"Smooth is fast\"\n   - \"One more\"\n   - \"This is what I trained for\"\n   - \"I don't stop\"\n\n---\n\n## Quick-Reference Race Day Checklist\n\n### One Week Out\n- [ ] Finalise goal time based on training simulations\n- [ ] Build pacing plan with target splits for every segment\n- [ ] Write splits on wrist band or race card\n- [ ] Test all race-day nutrition (gels, electrolytes, pre-race meal)\n- [ ] Begin taper \u2014 reduce training volume 30\u201340%\n\n### Race Morning\n- [ ] Consume high-carb, low-fibre meal 2\u20133 hours before start\n- [ ] Preload with electrolytes (1500 mg sodium + 500 ml water) 90 min before\n- [ ] Arrive 60\u201390 minutes early; check in, scout venue, locate bathrooms\n- [ ] Begin warm-up 30\u201345 min before wave\n- [ ] Consume caffeine gel 20\u201330 minutes before start\n- [ ] Write target splits on arm/wrist\n\n### During Race\n- [ ] Run 1: Start 5\u201310 sec/km SLOWER than target pace\n- [ ] Check pace every 500m on GPS watch\n- [ ] Stay under 85% max HR for first 3 runs\n- [ ] Conserve on SkiErg and Row \u2014 controlled effort\n- [ ] Never let sled stop completely\n- [ ] Chalk hands before sled pull and farmers carry\n- [ ] Take gel after Station 4, before Run 5\n- [ ] Full send on farmers carry \u2014 go as fast as possible\n- [ ] Attack lunges with long steps (0.9\u20131.1 m)\n- [ ] Execute wall ball break strategy \u2014 don't go unbroken unless trained for it\n- [ ] Sprint through the finish line\n\n### Post-Race\n- [ ] High-carb + protein meal within 30\u201360 min (60\u201380 g carbs, 20\u201330 g protein)\n- [ ] Rehydrate with electrolytes (not just water)\n- [ ] Review splits: identify slowest 2 segments for future training focus\n- [ ] Celebrate \u2014 you executed a plan\n\n---\n\n*Sources cited throughout this document: HyroxDataLab.com (Pacing Calculator Guide, Sandbag Lunges Strategy), RoxLyfe.com (multiple articles by the Rox Lyfe coaching team), HyroxTrainingPlans.com (5 Essential Pacing Tips), Precision Hydration (HYROX Fueling Guide), RMR Training (Warm-Up Guide), AidStation/Ash Miller (Nutrition Guide), Connect the Watts (10 Big Mistakes), George Anderson/Rox Lyfe (Mental Game), Centr/Meg Jacobi (SkiErg strategy), Rezerv.co (Beginner's Guide), Women's Health (HYROX Mistakes), 3in1Sports (Race Plan Tips), BLDRSports (Warm-Up Routine), Dr. Adam Storey/HYROX Sports Science Advisory Council (Farmers Carry), Gymshark (Training Guide), Bend and Mend Physiotherapy (HR Zones), Box Nutrition (Heart Rate Training), DocLyss Fitness (Warm-Up Reference), Ballinfit (Mental Toughness Strategies).*",
