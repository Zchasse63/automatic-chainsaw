          "snippet": "These intervals are most effective when athletes already possess a strong aerobic base and are targeting ceiling improvements. They are commonly applied during specific preparation phases in endurance sports, particularly in disciplines that require repeated high-intensity efforts, such as cross-country or Enduro mountain biking. Wisloff et al. (2007) demonstrated superior cardiovascular adaptations from 4 x 4-minute intervals compared to steady-state training of longer duration.\n\n\u2026\n\n*Recommended Formats*\n\n3 x 12\u201315 minutes at 90% FTP or 85\u201390% HRmax, 3 minutes rest\n\n4 x 8 minutes at 100% FTP, 2\u20133 minutes rest\n\n*Practical Application*\n\nThreshold training is especially relevant for athletes competing in events that require prolonged efforts at or near their anaerobic threshold. For example, mountain bike Enduro athletes benefit from threshold intervals during climbing stages or longer descents, where pacing near LT2 is required repeatedly throughout competition days. These intervals are often used during general preparation and early competition phases.\n\n\u2026\n\n*Recommended Formats*\n\n8 x 30 seconds at 150% FTP or maximal effort, 3 minutes rest\n\n10 x 1 minute at 120\u2013130% FTP, 1\u20132 minutes rest\n\n*Practical Application*\n\nThese intervals are highly taxing and require full recovery between repetitions to maintain quality. They are best reserved for late pre-season or in-season phases when anaerobic capacity and neuromuscular sharpness are performance priorities. Overuse may lead to excessive fatigue or diminished return due to central nervous system stress (Zemkov\u00e1, 2014).\n\n\u2026\n\n*Recommended Formats*\n\n3 x 20 minutes at 80\u201385% FTP, 5 minutes rest\n\nContinuous tempo effort: 45\u201360 minutes at 75\u201385% HRmax\n\n*Practical Application*\n\nMuscular endurance intervals are often used in early phases of training to increase aerobic volume efficiently. They support an athlete\u2019s ability to maintain output during longer training days or stage racing formats. In mountain biking, these intervals are also used to simulate sustained climbing and the demands of multi-hour races.",

          "snippet": "Today I would love for you to teach us how we can combine different protocols to achieve multiple adaptations in parallel-- for instance, how to improve endurance and strength, how to achieve some level of hypertrophy, perhaps directed hypertrophy at specific muscle groups, while also maintaining endurance and perhaps improving speed, for instance. And if you would, I'd love for you to tell us how we can combine different protocols and vary those across the week, across the month, across the year so that we can make regular progress and perhaps even could give us a window into the ways to make the fastest progress possible.\n\n\u2026\n\nIf you just walk down the line from there to strength, hey, same thing. If you get faster, that's going to aid in strength because force is mass times acceleration. So if you improve acceleration, you're contributing to strength. Same thing with power. So speed, power, and strength are generally very complementary. You can absolutely train all three of those goals at the same time and have no issues.",

Sure, not everyone needs a specific goal, but understanding the direction of your fitness journey can be a game-changer when it comes to motivation and progress tracking. Momentous Partner Dr. Andy Galpin is here to make things crystal clear by breaking down the various exercise adaptations and providing practical ways to test each of them. Get ready to be informed, educated, and empowered as we dive into this comprehensive guide designed to help you understand, assess, and elevate your fitness game.\n\n**Skill or Technique:**\n\n**Learning to move more effectively **\n\nBoosting your skill level in exercise is all about honing your ability to move smoothly and effectively. To gauge your progress in this area, try taking a joint-by-joint approach. Focus on key joints like the shoulder, elbow, low back, hip, knee, and ankle. By evaluating these joints through various exercises, you can assess your symmetry, stability, awareness, and range of motion. As you dedicate time and effort to improving these aspects, you'll notice enhanced movement patterns and a reduced risk of injury, helping you feel more confident and capable in your workouts.\n\n**Speed: **\n\n**Moving at a higher velocity or with a better rate of acceleration**\n\nSpeed is a game-changer in many athletic endeavors, and stepping up your pace can dramatically elevate your competitive advantage. To get a clear picture of your speed, give the tried-and-true 40-yard dash a shot. Or get technical and use velocity transducers on a barbell during resistance workouts. Monitoring your progress in speed offers valuable insights into how your training routine impacts your overall performance. With this knowledge in hand, you'll be well-equipped to fine-tune your workouts for even greater success.\n\n**Power: **\n\n**Speed multiplied by force**\n\nPower is the magic ingredient that turns good athletes into great ones, and it's born from the marriage of speed and force. To get a true sense of your power prowess, put yourself to the test with exercises like the broad jump and vertical jump. These tests will reveal how quickly and explosively you can summon force, giving you a window into your athletic potential. Keeping an eye on your power progress helps you understand your capabilities and empowers you to make smart adjustments to your training routine.\n\n**Force/Strength: **\n\n**How effectively you can move something**\n\nStrength is the bedrock of fitness, the powerful force that drives you to new heights in your physical pursuits. To get a clear picture of your strength, try your hand at diverse tests like grip strength assessments, dead hangs, leg extensions, and goblet squat holds. These exercises will reveal your current strength prowess and illuminate areas ripe for improvement ensuring you're always moving forward, one powerful step at a time.\n\n**Muscle Hypertrophy: **\n\n**How big your muscle is, muscle size**\n\nMuscle hypertrophy is about growing those muscles, boosting your strength, and building a body that makes heads turn. To keep tabs on your muscle gains, turn to body composition tests like DEXA scans or bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) \u2013 they'll paint a clear picture of your ever-evolving muscle mass. Understanding your muscle growth patterns can also empower you to optimize your workouts and achieve a well-rounded, strong, visually appealing physique.\n\n**Muscular Endurance: **\n\n**How many reps in a row you can do, localized to specific muscles or muscle groups**\n\nMuscular endurance is your muscles' staying power \u2013 their ability to keep going when the going gets tough. Exercises like planks or push-ups offer a great way to measure your muscles' ability to resist fatigue and keep pumping out those reps. By assessing your muscular endurance, you'll better understand how your muscles handle prolonged stress and identify which areas may need a little extra attention. Plus, these tests shine a light on your overall fitness level, letting you adjust your training for improved endurance and peak physical performance.\n\n**Anaerobic Capacity: **\n\n**Max heart rate, how much work you can do at max effort, global muscle fatigue**\n\nAnaerobic capacity is all about tapping into your body's ability to crush high-intensity work without relying on oxygen for fuel. It's a crucial aspect of fitness for athletes and enthusiasts who need to deliver short bursts of power and speed on the fly. To put your anaerobic capacity to the test, try out challenges like the Wingate or Bosco tests. These evaluations will help you measure your heart rate and overall fatigue levels during intense exercise, shedding light on your anaerobic prowess. Armed with this knowledge, you can customize your training program to target areas that need a boost, so you can truly unleash your inner powerhouse and excel in high-intensity activities.\n\n**Maximal Aerobic Capacity: **\n\n**Max heart rate and true VO2 max, 8-15-min range**\n\nMaximal aerobic capacity is your body's ability to efficiently use oxygen during prolonged exercise. It's the secret sauce for endurance athletes and anyone looking to excel in activities that demand continuous effort. To get a clear picture of your aerobic prowess, try taking a VO2 max test, the Cooper 12-minute run test, or the Rockport 1-mile walk test. These assessments will help you gauge your heart rate and overall endurance during extended workouts, revealing valuable insights into your aerobic fitness. By understanding your maximal aerobic capacity, you can optimize your training and enhance your endurance for activities that demand prolonged effort.\n\n**Long Duration: **\n\n**Sustained sub-maximal work (15+ minutes) with no breaks, changes, or drops (also known as steady state)**\n\nLong-duration exercises test your ability to keep going when the going gets tough. These workouts focus on your capacity to sustain consistent work output over extended periods without breaks, changes, or drops in intensity. Whether you're training for a marathon or just looking to improve your overall stamina, long-duration exercises like distance running or cycling can help you build the endurance you need. To measure your long-duration fitness, try maintaining a steady effort for 20+ minutes, relying solely on nasal breathing to encourage proper mechanics and a more efficient energy system. You'll gain invaluable insights into your overall endurance capabilities by keeping tabs on your performance during sustained sub-maximal work. This will empower you to advance your long-duration fitness.\n\nIt's not always necessary to have a specific goal in mind when it comes to improving your fitness. However, understanding your objectives and knowing how to test them can provide direction, motivation, and a means to track your progress. Improving these key areas improves our overall health, well-being, and movement quality. With the help of Momentous partner Dr. Andy Galpin, we now have access to invaluable tools to assess and enhance every aspect of our fitness journey. By embracing this comprehensive guide, you can take charge of your training, make informed decisions about your exercise regimen, and ultimately unlock your true potential.\n\n",

Fat Loss & Health**\n\n- Fat loss & general health benefits are reasons why a lot of people exercise\n\n**They are not specific training styles, they are byproducts of these nine protocols**\n\n\n\n- If you understand how fat loss occurs, you\u2019ll realize some of these nine protocols are effective for fat loss and some are not\n\n- Same for general health benefits\n\n**\u201cWhen we understand what it actually means to be healthy from a physiological perspective, then the rationale for what to train for is going to determine itself.\u201d**\u2013 *Dr. Andy Galpin*\n\n**Lifetime Endurance Training: VO2 Max & Other Health Metrics** **If you want to maximize health and overall functionality throughout time, it needs to be a combination of strength and endurance**\n\n- To highlight this, Andy talks about a study he did at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden\n\n- The Karolinska Institute in Stockholm is one of the founding places of all exercise physiology\n\n- To highlight this, Andy talks about a study he did at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden\n\n- For the study, they worked with people who were competitive skiers in the 1940s and 1950s\n\n- The skiers were now in their 80s and 90s living alone and healthy. They compared them to a group of individuals in America around the same age but who were not exercising\n\n- Both groups did a whole bunch of VO2 max tests\n\n**If your VO2 max is below 18 milliliters per kilogram per minute, your fitness is so low, you\u2019ll probably need to be in some sort of assisted living home**\n\n- If you are in VO2 max of 20 or 21 or 22, you\u2019re on that threshold\n\n- The group from America was right around that number\n\n**The group of competitive skiers was closer to 35 to 38 milliliters per kilogram per minute**\n\n- They had a 92-year-old individual with a VO2 max of 38, which was in their estimation, a world record, the highest VO2 max for somebody over the age of 90\n\n- The study clearly showed that lifelong endurance exercisers are markedly healthier than people who don\u2019t exercise\n\n**Endurance exercises are very important for chronic disease management, but they are not sufficient for overall global health** **This is because they do almost nothing for leg strength or any other marker of health**\n\n\n\n**Genetics vs. Lifestyle, Endurance Training & Identical Twins**\n\n- Andy\u2019s experiment with monozygotic twins; the perfect scientific experiment for exercise you could ever create\n\n- Monozygous twins (identical twins) are the perfect exercise for scientific experiments, they have the same DNA\n\n- They took stool and blood samples, vertical jump tests, maximum strength tests, MRIs of muscle mass, VO2 max tests, efficiency stuff, genetic testing, an IQ test, etc.\n\n- They wanted to look at everything to figure out what differed between the twins, and by how much\n\n- Again, they had another example of a classic endurance-only training paradigm, compared to a non-act\n\n- One of the twins was a lifelong endurance athlete, the other one didn\u2019t exercise at all\n\n**The exercising twin was significantly better at things like a lipid panel, resting heart rate, blood pressure, VO2 max**\n\n- The interesting aspect was the things that were in the middle\n\n- Their total amount of muscle mass was almost identical\n\n- The difference in actual body weight was due to body fat\n\n- The muscle quality was not in favor of the exerciser\n\n**The findings were almost identical to the Sweden study**\n\n- It highlighted the fact that if you want to move forward with optimal health, focusing solely on endurance exercises (cycling, running, etc.) is not gonna get you there\n\n**If you want to progress and move for high functionality, you have to do something besides just running**\n\n**Aging, Muscle Fibers & Exercise**\n\n- There are generally two types of muscle fibers: fast twitch and slow twitch\n\n**Selective reduction in fast-twitch fibers is a hallmark of aging**\n\n- It\u2019s difficult to activate them unless you\u2019re doing high-force activities\n\n**Slow twitch fibers stay around because we activate them doing almost any activity of daily living**\n\n- That\u2019s a problem because when you look at things like the need for leg strength through aging, the ability to catch yourself from a fall\n\n**Without fast-twitch muscle fibers, you don\u2019t have the speed to get your foot out in front of you on time, and you don\u2019t have the eccentric strength to stop the fall from happening**\n\n\n\n**Looking across the aging literature, it\u2019s very clear that maintaining strength and fast-fit fibers over time is important**\n\n- Can you change your fiber type with exercise? Yes, the limits of physiological adaptation are almost boundless given enough exposure\n\n**Exercise Physiology History; Strength Training Popularity** **Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s movies (Pumping Iron, Conan, the Terminator) changed how people viewed weight training**\n\n- Peter Karpovich\u2019s studies showed that strength training was safe and had many benefits, leading to a shift in the fitness industry\n\n- During the late 1970s and early 1980s, people began to understand the impact strength training had on physical appearance.\n\n- This realization led to the formation of the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) and an increase in the use of strength training in sports\n\n**How Circuit/Group Training Solved a Lot of the Problems the Classic Bodybuilding Hypertrophy Introduced** **When you\u2019re isolating muscle groups, that means a good part of your body is really not doing much throughout the day**\n\n- People start realizing they don\u2019t feel fit; they are out of breath just walking up the stairs\n\n- All that training does nothing for your cardiovascular fitness, nothing to improve heart rate, oxygenation, blood flow\n\n- Lifting weights is single joint, often machine, often slow, often high volume isolation stuff\n\n- That approach left a giant opening for CrossFit and kettlebell-type stuff, circuit training\n\n- The same or better results in under 30 minutes\n\n- You won\u2019t get so beat up because the volume\u2019s lower\n\n- The time is much lower\n\n- You get multiple adaptations at the same time\n\n**It was a brilliant solution for a lot of the problems the classic bodybuilding hypertrophy introduced**\n\n- They got away from isolation movements and got people doing big movements, which are more effective, generally better\n\n- It got people doing things fast and explosive. That\u2019s more athletic\n\n- That is more important for longevity. It solved a lot of problems like joint health\n\n- The problem with that though is less focus on movement quality and overemphasized scores\n\n**Exercise quality is more important than rep range, load, or time**\n\n\n\n**Movement/Skill Test** **Going to a physical therapist or movement specialist is the best route for assessing movement skills**\n\n- The four-step solution for assessing movement skills involves going joint by joint\n\n- The major joints to assess are the shoulder, elbow, low back, hip, knee, and ankle\n\n- How to do a representative movement for a well-rounded approach to exercise:\n\n- Do an upper body press, an upper body pull, a lower body press, and a lower body pull\n\n- If you bench a lot, use the bench. If you do pull-ups, use the pull-up. If you squat, do squats, etc.\n\n- Record a frontal view and a side view of the movement\n\n- Do 3 to 10 repetitions per angle\n\n- Slow and controlled, you don\u2019t need any body weight\n\n**Look for 4 key things at every joint (focusing on the ankle, knee, and hip)**\n\n- 4 key things to look for when doing a squat\n\n- Look for symmetry (is one moving further ahead than the other one, is one fidgeting and twitching around differently)\n\n- Look for stability (if your knees start shaking, that\u2019s an instability issue)\n\n- Can you do the movement slowly?\n\n- Be aware\n\n- Did you realize your heels were supposed to be on the ground all the time when you squat?\n\n- Full range of motion\n\n**Speed Test, Power Test** **According to Andy, a speed test is not so important because you can assume about speed from a power test and a power test is easier to do as well as easier to train for most people**\n\n- The cost-free version here is a simple broad jump\n\n- Normal position, jump out as far in front of you as you possibly can and measure the distance between where you started and the back of your heel where it lands\n\n- You\u2019re gonna stand still; no running\n\n- You can swing, and bounce as much as you\u2019d like to do\n\n- Measure the distance from the tip of your toe\n\n- Stand behind the line and then the furthest point back where you land\n\n- A basic number to look for there is your height; you should be able to broad jump how tall you are\n\n- If you\u2019re 5\u20195\u2033, you should have 5\u20195\u2033, 6\u20195\u2033, etc.\n\n- For females, that\u2019s gonna ratchet down a little bit\n\n- We\u2019re not looking for optimization in this particular test. What you are looking for red flags\n\n**If you can jump your body height, you\u2019re gonna be just fine**\n\n- Classic vertical jump for a more accurate number\n\n- You can just measure two of your hands, and put them together so that both of your middle fingers are touching\n\n- Overlap them and put them directly over your head\n\n- Then you want to reach up as high as you can get and mark that on the wall\n\n- Then, you\u2019re gonna jump with those two hands and touch as high as you can up\n\n- And you\u2019re gonna measure the distance between your standing reach and the actual height that you jump there\n\n- The reason you\u2019re doing it two-handed is that if you do it one-handed, you can reach pretty high by offsetting your shoulders\n\n- No running approach here. You can dip, you can drive, you can do all those things. You can swing your arms\n\n- Look for a number of 24 inches or higher\n\n- If you\u2019re past the age of 50, that number can come down a little bit to closer to 20\n\n- For females, it\u2019s gonna be ratcheted down about 15%\n\n- If you\u2019re a middle-aged female and you\u2019re jumping 20 inches, you\u2019re in a pretty good spot\n\n- If you can do that on a force plate, that\u2019s even better\n\n- And these are very interesting because they\u2019ll tell you not only how high you jump, but they\u2019ll tell you how much force you put into the ground and how long it took you (rate of force development)\n\n**Strength Test** **There are two easy ways to measure your grip strength: dynamometer and dead hang**\n\n- A hand grip dynamometer is anywhere between $20 to $100\n\n- Those are going to give you a value in kilograms\n\n- Look for a minimum score of 40 kilograms\n\n- Ideally, 60 would be a really good score\n\n**You want to make sure that there\u2019s no less than a 10% variation between your left and right hand**\n\n- Your non-dominant hand shouldn\u2019t be much weaker in this test\n\n**If you are a male and you\u2019re under 40 kilograms on a hand grip dynamometer, you will need to work on that**\n\n- For females, about 35 kilograms is the cutoff point\n\n**For a dead hang, find a bar that is thin enough to where you can wrap your whole hand around it**\n\n- In general, you should be able to hang for a minimum of 30 seconds\n\n- 30 to 50 seconds is good but could be better\n\n- Above 60 seconds is the sweet spot for dead hang\n\n- Dead hang is a good example of when females tend to be better\n\n**Grip strength in women tends to be strong and they can hang for quite a long time**\n\n- Be wary of weight; if you are exceptionally large, this thing doesn\u2019t scale perfectly\n\n- Leg extension test-one rep max\n\n- Use repetition conversion equation; put on a load that is close to your maximum and just do it for as many reps as you can\n\n- As long as it\u2019s under five reps total, you can then actually go online and enter that into any number of calculators anywhere\n\n- Front squat or a goblet squat hold\n\n- Hold a weight in front of your chest (kettlebell, dumbbell)\n\n- Hold about half of your body weight, go all the way to the bottom position, and try to hold that for about 45 seconds\n\n- It\u2019s a pretty good indicator of your position, core strength, and low back stability\n\n- It\u2019s more difficult than the leg extension, but it\u2019s quite a bit more functional and it\u2019s gonna give you insight into a lot more areas than just the quadriceps\n\n**Don\u2019t do any exercise to exhaustion or maximum strength if you\u2019re not comfortable with your technique**\n\n- If you\u2019re not comfortable with the front squat, do the leg extension\n\n**Never utilize maximum testing if it\u2019s gonna come with the consequence of serious acute injury** **Whenever you do these tests, you want to make sure that that warm-up protocol is standardized**\n\n**Hypertrophy Test**\n\n- The best way to do a hypertrophy test:\n\n- Any sort of body composition test can do this (DEXA scan is a gold standard)\n\n- Pay attention to FFMI (fat-free mass index), and use an online calculator to calculate your FFMI score\n\n**Your FFMI should be at least 20 for men and 18 for women, assuming you are reasonably lean**\n\n- That\u2019s going to tell you if you have sufficient muscle mass\n\n- All you need to know is your total body weight, your body fat percentage, and then your height\n\n- Enter those three numbers and then they\u2019ll tell you your FFMI score\n\n**Muscular Endurance Test, Push-Up** **You can do any number of tests here, but a standard push-up is a good testament to muscular endurance**\n\n- If you can\u2019t do a single push-up, that\u2019s not a muscular endurance issue, that\u2019s actually now a strength issue\n\n- 25 consecutive push-ups for a male is a standard\n\n- Something like 10 is kind of minimum categories\n\n- If you\u2019re sub-five, you have a problem\n\n- When doing a push-up; full complete lockout of the elbows on the top and a full chest touch or close to it at the ground\n\n**Anaerobic Capacity Test, Heart Rate**\n\n- This one\u2019s more challenging because you either have to go to a laboratory and do something like Wingate test protocol, or Bosco protocol\n\n- If you can\u2019t go to a lab, you can do this on any protocol you want (e.g. sprinting, air bike, rower, etc.)\n\n- Anything where you can exert maximal effort and don\u2019t have to worry about technical problems\n\n**This is a 30-second maximal test where you\u2019re going to see how much work can you do in that 30 seconds**\n\n- You want to think about how to get close to your predicted maximum heart rate\n\n**Get up to a maximum heart rate and then test your heart rate recovery**\n\n- You should be looking for about a half a beat recovery per second\n\n- Get up to a place of terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue. Test your heart rate and then count.\n\n- You should have a heart rate recovery of 30 beats per minute\n\n**Maximal Heart Rate Test, VO2 Max**\n\n- The gold standard here is to go into a laboratory, put a mask on and get this thing done\n\n- If you don\u2019t have access to that, you can do a couple of tests:\n\n- One of them is called a 12-minute Cooper\u2019s test\n\n- Run for 12 minutes as far as you can, and record the distance you covered\n\n- You can go online to any number of calculators, enter that distance in, and that will tell you your estimated VO2 max\n\n- One of them is called a 12-minute Cooper\u2019s test\n\n- The goal is to get the maximum distance covered in 12 minutes\n\n- That\u2019s anywhere between a mile to 2-plus miles\n\n- Aerobic capacity is 8 to 12 minutes where you\u2019re going to see a real true test of that VO2 max\n\n- You simply can\u2019t get that in under a few minutes\n\n- A little gentler version of that is a one-mile walk test\n\n- Use a stopwatch or ideally a heart rate monitor\n\n**Long Duration Steady State Exercise Test**\n\n- Maintain a consistent workout for over 20+ minutes\n\n- Can you maintain moving at a nonwalking pace without stopping? That\u2019s all it needs to be\n\n**20+ minutes of work with no breaks, no intervals, no downtime**\n\n- Ideally, you should do this with nasal breathing only\n\n**Fitness Testing Frequency & Testing Order** **Andy recommends making the entire list once a year, within a week**\n\n- A 3-day split here is probably the best\n\n- What is the testing order?\n\n**The non-fatiguing test you can do whenever**\n\n- This is the body composition scan, the FFMI, the body fat composition, all this stuff can be done wherever\n\n- Andy prefers to do that as your very first activity because acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition measurements (due to inflammation, water storage, etc.)\n\n- It\u2019s easiest to just get that off of a 48-hour rest\n\n- You want to make sure you don\u2019t do any hard exercise the day before a body composition test and probably 48 hours before\n\n\n\n- Your movement test can be the same thing\n\n- You don\u2019t want to try to assess how well you\u2019re squatting if you\u2019re sore from a squatting test\n\n**VO2 Max Measurements** **For men, a minimum number is 35 milliliters per kilogram per minute** **For women, it\u2019s about 30**\n\n\n\n- You can push a lot higher on those things in reality; Andy wants to see men above 50\n\n- What these metrics mean is how much oxygen can you bring in per kilogram of body weight per minute\n\n- It is a volume of oxygen per your size in a time duration\n\n- The way that you calculate it is you multiply your cardiac output by what\u2019s called your AVO2 difference\n\n- Your cardiac output is your heart rate times your stroke volume; how much blood you\u2019re pumping out per pump is your stroke volume\n\n- You multiply that by your AVO2 difference (artery minus vein difference)\n\n- It\u2019s the amount of oxygen in your arteries minus the amount of oxygen in your vein\n\n- This tells you how much you took up in your capillaries, in your muscles\n\n- VO2 max; you take those two factors and multiply them together\n\n",

[89] demonstrated that an interval training program using a higher intensity than that derived from continuous exercise yielded a greater activation of AMP-activated protein kinase in Type II muscle fibers. In this way, conducting training in z2 and z3 while recruiting Type II muscle fibers may provide the mechanical and metabolic advantages both of running close to race pace and at LT2 intensity, respectively.\n\n\u2026\n\nThese findings agree with the existence of a threshold in fatigue development dependent on whether exercise is carried out at, just below, or just above LT2 intensity. Accordingly, distance runners may benefit from covering some of their interval training sessions at z3 but at faster absolute speeds than vLT2 (assessed through a continuous incremental test) rather than in z4.",

          "snippet": "Determining LT1 and setting Zone 2 intensity is most accurately done through blood lactate measurements from a graded exercise test in a physiology lab. However, athletes can estimate Zone 2 boundaries using field tests that determine Lactate Threshold (LT2) heart rate or power. Zone 2 intensity is typically estimated as 55\u201375% of LT2/FTP power or 68\u201383% of LT2 heart rate.\n\n\u2026\n\n**Improved Fat Oxidation:**Zone 2 training enhances the efficiency of mitochondria in slow-twitch muscle fibers, optimizing fat usage as a fuel source. **Enhanced Lactate Clearance:**Long-duration Zone 2 sessions train the body to shuttle lactate from fast-twitch to slow-twitch fibers, where it can be reused as energy.\nThis prevents early fatigue. **Glycogen Preservation:**Adaptation to Zone 2 reduces reliance on glycogen during submaximal efforts, which is critical for endurance in long events due to our limited glycogen stores. **Improved Aerobic Capacity:**Regular Zone 2 training boosts capillary density, enhances blood flow to muscles, and improves oxygen delivery and utilization.\n**Increased Training Tolerance:**A strong aerobic base built through Zone 2 allows athletes to handle higher intensity workouts without overtraining. **Recovery and Injury Prevention:**Low-to-moderate intensity efforts in Zone 2 are less taxing on the body, making them ideal for active recovery while reducing injury risk.\n\n**Health Benefits of Zone 2 Training**\n\n\u2026\n\n**How Much Zone 2 Training Is Best?**\n\nThe popular answer for endurance athletes is that about 80% of your training volume should be in Zones 1 and 2, with the remaining 20% consisting of harder intervals. Some people think of 80/20 on a session basis, meaning 80% of your training sessions for a given period (week or month, for instance) should be easy aerobic intensity.\n\n\u2026\n\nTake our free 2-minute quiz to discover how effective your training is and get recommendations for how you can improve.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Aerobic Threshold (LT1) and Zone 2 training are the foundation of effective endurance programs. By maximizing fat oxidation and building a robust aerobic base, athletes not only enhance endurance but also develop the metabolic flexibility required for varied race conditions. These adaptations come from consistent, methodical training, embodying the principle of \u201cslow to go fast\u201d as a mantra for endurance success.",

Exercise Physiology\n\nVolume 16 - 2025 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2025.1519240\n\nThis article is part of the Research TopicResponses and Adaptations to Novel Exercise ModalitiesView all 17 articles\n\n# Acute physiological responses and performance determinants in Hyrox \u00a9 \u2013 a new running-focused high intensity functional fitness trend\n\nTom Brandt*^\u2020^Cindy EbelChristopher LebahnAnnette Schmidt\n- Institute of Sports Science, University of the Bundeswehr Munich, Neubiberg, Germany\n\n**Aims:** Hyrox^\u00a9^ is a fitness modality combining 8 functional exercises with running in a comprehensive competition format. Within this first scientific study on Hyrox^\u00a9^, acute physiological responses, relative perceived exertion (RPE), and possible performance determinants were assessed during a simulated Hyrox^\u00a9^ competition to derive training recommendations and potential practical applications.\n\n**Methods:** Eleven recreational Hyrox^\u00a9^ athletes [27% women, Hyrox^\u00a9^ experience median (interquartile range): 18 (19) months] participated. In a pre-test, height, body composition, hand grip strength (HGS), maximum oxygen consumption (VO~2~max), and volume of resistance and endurance training were assessed. After 48 h rest, a simulated Hyrox^\u00a9^ was conducted according to the competition-standards of the \u201cIndividual Open Division\u201d. Heart rate (HR) was tracked throughout the Hyrox^\u00a9^. Blood lactate (BL) and RPE were recorded at the beginning and after each run and exercise station. Differences between runs and exercise stations for HR, BL, and RPE were analyzed via Wilcoxon signed rank test. Spearman\u2019s rank correlation test was conducted to identify associations between completion times (Hyrox^\u00a9^, runs, exercise stations) and participant characteristics. Values are given as median (interquartile range).\n\n**Results:** Completion time of the Hyrox^\u00a9^ was 86.5 (14.5) minutes, whereby runs (51.2 (14.1) minutes) were significantly longer than the exercise stations [32.8 (6.1) minutes] (p = 0.003). Most of the Hyrox^\u00a9^ was performed at very hard and hard intensities [79.5 (21)% and 19.6 (20.7)% of maximum HR]. Maximum BL was higher during the exercise stations [8.5 (5.4) mmol/L] compared to the runs (7.7 (4.6) mmol/L) (p = 0.006). Similar results were found for maximum RPE [exercise stations: 18 (2), runs: 16 (2), p = 0.003]. The highest values for HR, BL, and RPE occurred during the last exercise (wall balls). The exercise stations with the heaviest loads were completed the fastest [sled push: 128 (34) seconds, sled pull: 155 (38) seconds]. Faster Hyrox^\u00a9^ completion correlated significantly with higher VO~2~max (p = 0.01), greater endurance training volume (p = 0.04), and lower body fat percentage (p = 0.03).\n\n**Conclusion:** Hyrox^\u00a9^ is a HIFT modality with an emphasis on endurance capacity and moderate to low requirements in terms of maximum strength, coordination, and mobility when compared to other forms HIFT. Hyrox^\u00a9^ may be suitable for health promotion and tactical population training.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nHigh-intensity interval training (HIIT), strength training with free weights, bodyweight training, and functional fitness training (FFT) have been ongoing trends for years and were among the top 10 trends in the fitness industry in 2023 (Thompson, 2023). Fitness racing such as Hyrox^\u00a9^ (Upsolut Sports GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) is a new fitness domain combining elements of these training modalities in a comprehensive competition format (Bergmann, 2024). Similar to CrossFit^\u00a9^ (CF) (CrossFit, Inc., Washington, DC, United States) \u2013 one of the most popular FFT concepts \u2013 Hyrox^\u00a9^ also incorporates elements of gymnastics, weightlifting, and endurance sports (Glassman, 2020). In contrast to CF, a Hyrox^\u00a9^ competition always consists of the same 8 exercises (ski ergometer, sled push, sled pull, burpee broad jump, rowing ergometer, farmers carry, sandbag lunges, and wall balls) and 8 runs [each 1,000 meters (m)]. Runs and exercises are completed alternately one after the other, whereby the competition always starts with a run. Weights and distances of the exercises are adjusted based on gender, division, and mode (e.g., Individual Open, Individual Pro, Double, Relay), allowing athletes of varying fitness levels to participate. The first Hyrox^\u00a9^ competition took place in 2017. Considering that in the 2022/2023 season already 90,000 Hyrox^\u00a9^ athletes worldwide competed despite the corona pandemic, a further increase in popularity could be expected (Bergmann, 2024). Nevertheless, Hyrox^\u00a9^ is not represented in the scientific literature up to date. Accordingly, little is known about acute physiological responses and performance determinants. However, this information is essential for developing effective training programs and exploring potential application areas of Hyrox^\u00a9^ beyond competitive sport. Indeed, previous research on other sports respectively training concepts that appear to be closely related to Hyrox^\u00a9^ such as CF, concurrent training (CT), and running may provide some insight in this regard.\n\nLooking at CF, there is a considerable amount of research providing information for coaches, athletes, and health professionals in terms of physiological and psychological demands, performance predictors, injury rates, health benefits, and motivational aspects (Claudino et al., 2018; Dexheimer et al., 2019; \u00c1ngel Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2022; Brandt et al., 2024; Dominski et al., 2021). Regarding health and fitness, previous research showed that CF improves cardiovascular fitness, body composition, mobility, strength, and back health, while being associated with a low injury risk (1.9 \u2013 3.2 injuries per 1000 hours [h]) (Gianzina and Kassotaki, 2019; Brandt et al., 2024; Hak et al., 2013). In terms of performance, it was demonstrated that a lower body fat percentage, higher total body strength, and maximum oxygen consumption (VO~2~max) correlated with better CF performance (Meier et al., 2023a). However, the investigated CF workouts (e.g., Fran, Cindy, Isabel, Murph) were considerably shorter than a Hyrox^\u00a9^ competition (Ahmad et al., 2018; Rios et al., 2024a; Rios et al., 2024b; Carreker and Grosicki, 2020). The single study on physiological demands covering longer bouts of CF was conducted over the course of regular 60-minute [min] CF training sessions (Meier et al., 2023b). This limits the extent to which conclusions could be derived about the physiological demands of Hyrox^\u00a9^. Unlike CF, which emphasizes constantly varied functional movements, Hyrox^\u00a9^ places a greater focus on running, with a total of 8 kilometers [km] per competition and less exercise variety (Bergmann, 2024; Glassman, 2020).\n\nOn endurance exercise such as running, extensive research has been carried out in a large number of different populations with regard to physiological demands, health benefits, or injury patterns. Performance in Olympic endurance events is typically achieved at intensities exceeding 85% of the VO~2~max. Joyner and Coyle concluded that endurance athletes need to be relatively fatigue resistant at intensities that stimulate significant anaerobic metabolism (Joyner and Coyle, 2008). The most important factors especially for running performance therefore include maximal oxygen uptake (VO~2~max), lactate threshold, and running economy (Joyner, 1991). Regarding health benefits, a meta-analysis with a pooled sample of N = 232,149 participants showed that running is associated with a 27%, 30%, and 23% reduced risk of all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality (Pedisic et al., 2020). Lee et al. stated that, from a public health perspective, running could be the most cost-effective lifestyle medicine, exceeding the importance of risk factors like smoking, obesity, hypertension, or diabetes (Lee et al., 2017). Nevertheless, running is associated with an injury risk of 6.8\u201359 injuries per 1,000 h whereby history of previous injuries, mileage but also training volume and frequency need to be considered to prevent injury (Saragiotto et al., 2014; Fields et al., 2010). While research on endurance exercise \u2013 and in particular running \u2013 provides indications regarding the demands and effects of Hyrox^\u00a9^, the specific characteristics of Hyrox^\u00a9^ (e.g., integration of functional exercises) might lead to divergent findings.\n\nBesides running, Hyrox^\u00a9^ includes exercises such as sled pushes (men: 202 kilograms [kg], women: 152 kg) and sled pulls (men: 153 kg, women: 103 kg) where heavy external weights need to be moved (Bergmann, 2024). This suggests that Hyrox^\u00a9^ training regimes should also include resistance training to some extent. Notably, resistance training may not only improve competition performance but health (e.g., reducing cardiovascular disease, hypertension, all-cause-mortality, and the offset of age-related declines in strength, power, and muscle mass) (Fyfe et al., 2022). Nevertheless, implementation of additional strength training needs to be done with caution because volume and frequency are critical risk factors for injury (Saragiotto et al., 2014; Fields et al., 2010). Furthermore, previous research in the field of CT showed that combining resistance and endurance training poses a challenge, as the specific adaptations from each type of training may potentially interfere with one another. Therefore, to manage overall fatigue, reduce negative interferences, and avoid injuries, knowing the specific demands of Hyrox^\u00a9^ in terms of strength and endurance capacity is essential according to CT research (Methenitis, 2018; Wilson et al., 2012).\n\nHowever, no scientific studies to date have investigated Hyrox^\u00a9^ in this respect, making it difficult to develop evidence-based training programs or identify potential benefits and practical applications beyond competitive sports. Therefore, this study analyzed the acute physiological responses as well as potential performance predictors in Hyrox^\u00a9^ athletes during a simulated Hyrox^\u00a9^ competition.\n\n## 2 Materials and methods\n\n### 2.1 Trial overview\n\nThis study was conducted at the University of the Bundeswehr Munich (UniBw M). Participants attended 2 separate test sessions \u2013 a pre-test and a simulated Hyrox^\u00a9^ competition. The simulated Hyrox^\u00a9^ was performed 2\u201314 days after the pre-test. The Institutional Ethics Committee of the UniBw M approved the study protocol, ensuring that it conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study (08.02.2024; EK UniBw M 24-05). An overview of the trial is displayed in Figure 1.\n\n### 2.2 Participants\n\nThe study involved recreational Hyrox^\u00a9^ athletes (N = 11, 27% women, Hyrox^\u00a9^ experience: 18 (19) months) who were at least 18 years old and had participated in at least one official Hyrox^\u00a9^ competition prior to the study. Exclusion criteria were health issues that would preclude participation in the applied tests (e.g., cardiovascular diseases, respiratory disorders, severe injuries to the musculoskeletal system, osteoporosis, intervertebral disc damage, joint replacements, hypertension). No adverse events occurred during the test sessions. Participant characteristics are displayed in Table 1.\n\n### 2.3 Procedure\n\n#### 2.3.1 Pre-test\n\nThe aim of the pre-test was to collect measures of body composition, strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, and training status. Participants were instructed to avoid any intensive physical activity 48 h, alcohol consumption 24 h, and food intake 3 h prior the test. Moreover, they should not drink more than 500 mL of water 30 min before the measurement and empty their bladder. The pre-test comprised a questionnaire, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), hand grip strength (HGS) test, and cardiopulmonary exercise test on a treadmill (CPET).\n\n##### 2.3.1.1 Questionnaire\n\nParticipants were asked for their gender and age [years], hours of resistance as well as endurance training per week [h/wk], and Hyrox^\u00a9^ experience in months.\n\n##### 2.3.1.2 Body composition and height\n\nHeight [cm], weight [kg], and body composition (body fat percentage [%] and muscle mass percentage [%]) were measured in underwear. Height was assessed with a SECA\u00ae 213 (seca GmbH and Co. KG, Hamburg, Germany) and body composition with a SECA\u00ae mBCA 515 scale (seca GmbH and Co. KG, Hamburg, Germany). According to Bosy-Westphal et al., the SECA\u00ae mBCA 515 is a valid and precise tool to estimate body composition (Bosy-Westphal et al., 2017; Bosy-Westphal et al., 2013).\n\n##### 2.3.1.3 Hand grip strength test\n\nHGS was measured with the Baseline\u00ae Smedley Digital hand-held dynamometer (Fabrication Enterprises, New York, United States) and given in kg. For the measurement, participants sat upright on a chair with their feet on the ground and a 90\u00b0 angle in their knee joint. The elbow was flexed at 90\u00b0 with the fingertips pointed ventrally and the palm facing medially. Starting with the dominant hand, participants were instructed to squeeze the dynamometer as hard as they could for 5 seconds [sec]. Each hand was measured thrice with 30 s of rest between trials, whereby the highest of all 6 measures was used for the analysis. HGS strongly correlates with strength in other muscle groups and can be used as a predictor for total muscle strength (Wind et al., 2010). Furthermore, since Hyrox^\u00a9^ is a fitness racing modality including exercises that require athletes to hold and pull external loads during sled pulls and farmers carry, HGS could influence performance.\n\n##### 2.3.1.4 Cardiopulmonary exercise test\n\nThe participants performed an incremental exercise test on a h/p/cosmos pulsar\u00ae 3p treadmill (h/p/cosmos, Traunstein, Germany). Women started at 6 km/h and men at 7 km/h, both at an incline of 1%. The speed was increased by 1 km/h every 3 min until participants were unable to maintain running pace. As proposed by Rosenerger and Schommer, exhaustion criteria comprised a respiratory exchange ratio >1.1, plateauing of VO~2~ consumption, and a HR reaching or exceeding 100% \u00b1 10% of the age-predicted HR~max~ (Scharhag-Rosenberger and Schommer, 2013). Heart rate (HR) was continuously tracked with a smartLAB hrm W sensor worn at the chest (HMM Diagnostics GmbH, Heddesheim, Germany). To assess cardiopulmonary indices the COSMED Quark CPET (COSMED, Rome, Italy) was used. VO~2~max [mL/min/kg] was determined by averaging the oxygen uptake over the last 30 s at the participant\u2019s peak performance.\n\n#### 2.3.2 Simulated Hyrox \u00a9 competition\n\nIn the simulated Hyrox^\u00a9^ competition test, physiological responses were assessed in order to estimate the demands of a Hyrox^\u00a9^ competition. Participants were instructed to avoid any intensive physical activity 48 h prior the test. All participants completed the Hyrox^\u00a9^ according to the standards of the \u201cIndividual Open Division\u201d. The exercise execution followed the guidelines outlined for Hyrox^\u00a9^ competitions (Bergmann, 2024). Each participant completed the test alone in a gym. The 8 runs and exercise stations were performed in alternating order, always starting with a 1 km run on a Woodway Curve treadmill (WOODWAY, Weil am Rhein, Germany). The exercise stations were (1) ski ergometer (1000 m; Concept2, Morrisville, USA), (2) sled push (4 \u00d7 12.5m, women: 102 kg, men: 152 kg, including weight of the sled) (3) sled pull (4 \u00d7 12.5m, women: 78 kg, men: 103 kg, including weight of the sled), (4) burpee broad jumps (4 \u00d7 20 m), (5) rowing ergometer (1000 m; Concept2, Morrisville, USA), (6) farmers carry (8 \u00d7 25 m, women: 2 \u00d7 16 kg kettle bell, men: 2 \u00d7 24 kg kettle bell), (7) sandbag lunges (4 \u00d7 25 m, women: 10 kg, men: 20 kg), and (8) wall balls (women: 75 repetitions with 4 kg, men: 100 repetitions with 6 kg). Participants were instructed to complete the Hyrox^\u00a9^ as fast as possible. The test setup in the gym is shown in Figure 2.\n\nThe completion times were recorded for the full Hyrox^\u00a9^, the accumulated runs, the accumulated exercise stations as well as for each run and exercise station. During the test, the participants wore a smartLAB hrm W sensor at the chest (HMM Diagnostics GmbH, Heddesheim, Germany) to track their HR. The maximum heart rate (HR~max~) and average HR (HR~avg~) was determined for the complete Hyrox^\u00a9^, as well as for the accumulated runs, accumulated exercise stations, and each individual run and exercise station. The relative HR [%HR~max~] was calculated to the second for the entire Hyrox^\u00a9^ to estimate the exercise intensity according to the guidelines of the American College of Sports Medicine (very light, light, moderate, hard, very hard, maximum) (Pollock et al., 1998).\n\nBlood lactate concentration (BL) in millimoles per liter [mmol/L] was measured with a Lactate Scout+ (SensLab GmbH, Leipzig, Germany) before the test, after each run, after each exercise station, and at 3 and 6 min after the completion of the final exercise station. Simultaneously with the lactate measurements, relative perceived exertion (RPE) was assessed using the Borg scale (scale from 6\u201320 with 6 being the lowest and 20 the highest possible perceived exertion). The scale was presented and explained to the participants beforehand, following the standards for its use in sports medicine as recommended by L\u00f6llgen (Borg, 1998; L\u00f6llgen, 2004). The maximum BL (BL~max~), maximum RPE (RPE~max~), average BL (BL~avg~), and average RPE (RPE~avg~) was determined for the complete Hyrox^\u00a9^, as well as for the accumulated runs, and accumulated exercise stations.\n\n### 2.4 Statistical analysis\n\nThe statistical analysis was conducted with Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, United States) and SPSS 29\u00ae (IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY, United States). Normal distribution was analyzed via Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Q-Q-plots. Values are given as median (interquartile range). Differences between the runs and workout stations in terms of physiological responses and RPE were analyzed via Wilcoxon signed rank test. The effect size r was calculated based on the z-value and the sample size. Spearman\u2019s rank correlation test was performed to identify associations between the completion times (complete Hyrox^\u00a9^, runs, exercise stations) and participant characteristics (e.g., measures of body composition, strength, and endurance). Spearman\u2019s rho was reported as the correlation coefficient. Statistical significance was set at p \u2264 0.05.\n\n## 3 Results\n\nParticipants completed the Hyrox^\u00a9^ in 86.5 (14.5) min, whereby the time spent running [51.2 (14.1) min] was significantly longer than the time to complete the exercise stations [32.8 (6.1) min] (p = 0.003, r = 0.88). The percentage share of the specific exercise stations and runs in the total time to completion is displayed in Figure 3. The shortest median times to completion occurred for sled push [2.1 (0.6) min], sled pull [2.6 (0.6) min], and farmers carry [2.7 (0.7 min]. Run 5 [7.4 (1.6) min], Run 8 [6.8 (1.3) min], and Run 6 [6.8 (1.9) min] took participants the longest.\n\nDuring the Hyrox, participants achieved a HR~max~ of 185 (26) bpm, with significantly higher values for the exercise stations [185 (26) bpm] compared to the runs [180 (26) bpm] (p = 0.04, r = 62). Similarly, the HR~avg~ in the full Hyrox^\u00a9^ reached 170.9 (21.2) bpm while participants completed the exercise stations at a higher HR~avg~ (173.7 (19.5) bpm) compared to the runs [168.9 (21.9) bpm] (p = 0.03, r = 64). Most of the time, participants performed at very hard [79.5 (21) %] and hard [19.6 (20.7) %] intensities. The distribution of the intensity ranges is shown in Figure 4.\n\nPhysiologically, the hard to very hard intensity was also reflected in the values for BL~max~ [8.5 (5.4) mmol/L] during the Hyrox^\u00a9^. Again, BL~max~ was significantly higher after the exercise stations [8.5 (5.4) mmol/L] compared to the runs [7.7 (4.6) mmol/L] (p = 0.006, r = 83). Looking at BL~avg~ during the Hyrox^\u00a9^ [6.3 (3.8) mmol/L], the values after the workouts [6.6 (3.7) mmol/L] were higher in comparison to the runs [6.2 (3.9) mmol/L] (p = 0.003, r = 0.88).\n\nThe RPE~max~ score during the Hyrox^\u00a9^ reached 18 (2), whereby the participants rated the exercise stations [18 (2)] as significantly more strenuous than the runs [16 (2)] (p = 0.003, r = 0.91). Likewise, participants had a RPE~avg~ of 14.1 (1.5) in the Hyrox^\u00a9^, with significantly higher values during the exercise stations [14.4 (1.9)] compared to the runs [13.4 (1.3)] (p = 0.003, r = 0.89). Values for physiological responses and RPE are given in Table 2.\n\nThe highest values for HR~max~ [183 (21) bpm], BL [8.5 (4.9)], and RPE [18 (1)] were seen in the last exercise station, the wall balls. The course of the HR as well as BL and RPE values are displayed for the Hyrox^\u00a9^ in Figure 5.\n\nCorrelation analyses showed multiple associations between the participant characteristics and performance in the Hyrox^\u00a9^. The strongest correlation was found for VO~2~max (\u03c1 = - 0.71, p = 0.01), followed by endurance training volume (\u03c1 = - 0.68, p = 0.04), and body fat percentage (\u03c1 = 0.67, p = 0.03). Independent analyses of performance during runs and workouts with participants characteristics revealed correlations only for the runs, but not the exercise stations. Strong correlations were seen for VO~2~max (\u03c1 = - 0.73, p = 0.01) and body fat percentage (\u03c1 = 0.68, p = 0.02). Results of the correlations analyses are shown in Table 3.\n\nAll participants had the technical proficiency and mobility to perform the exercises according to the Hyrox^\u00a9^ movement standards. They further had sufficient strength to execute all exercise station with the competition-standard loads.\n\n## 4 Discussion\n\n### 4.1 Classification and physiological demands of Hyrox \u00a9\n\nThe observed physiological responses and RPE clearly illustrated the high-intensity nature of Hyrox^\u00a9^ (Pollock et al., 1998). Given that Hyrox^\u00a9^ comprises multi-joint, compound movements performed at high intensities, with loads reaching up to 152 kg for women and 202 kg for men, Hyrox^\u00a9^ can be classified as a HIFT modality (Feito et al., 2018). Since more than 60% of the total completion time was spent running, Hyrox^\u00a9^ should be further specified as a running-focused form of HIFT.\n\nBased on the overall duration [86.5 (14.5) min] in conjunction with HR and BL values, it is to assume that participants had to rely on both aerobic as well as anaerobic metabolic pathways to complete the Hyrox^\u00a9^. Compared to the runs, the exercise stations were significantly more intense indicating higher energy demands per time. In this regard, it is to note that the exercise stations with the heaviest external loads (sled push and sled pull) were completed the fastest. Median completion times of these movements still ranged between 2\u20133 min indicating that Hyrox^\u00a9^ requires athletes to exert a considerable amount of force over prolonged periods of time with anaerobic glycolysis being a key contributor to energy production during these phases. The importance of anaerobic energy production was also confirmed for other HIFT domains such as CF. However, Fernandez et al. and Forte et al. reported considerably higher BL values for CF workouts (mean \u00b1 standard deviation: up to 15.8 \u00b1 4.9 mmol/L) (Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2015; Forte et al., 2022). This is in line with recent findings of Sousa Neto et al. who investigated physiological responses after the CF benchmark workout \u201cKaren\u201d (150 repetitions of wall balls with a 9 kg ball as fast as possible) and found significant increases of BL reaching even higher values 17.5 \u00b1 3 mmol/L) (Sousa Neto et al., 2022). Nevertheless, most of the investigated CrossFit^\u00a9^ workouts were shorter than 20 min (Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2015; Forte et al., 2022; Sousa Neto et al., 2022). One exception might be the CF workout Murph, in which physiological responses similar to Hyrox^\u00a9^ were observed (HR~max~ = 185.6 \u00b1 7.6 bpm, HR~avg~ = 168.8 \u00b1 6.4 bpm, and BL = 10 \u00b1 3 mmol/L). However, Murph was completed substantially faster (43.4 \u00b1 4.6 min) and classified by shorter running distance (2 miles) and time (17.6 \u00b1 2 min) leading to divergent demands for the athletes (Carreker and Grosicki, 2020).\n\nOn the other hand, unlike HIFT modalities such as CF where athletes are prepared for \u201cthe unknown and unknowable,\u201d exercises but also the loads being moved in Hyrox^\u00a9^ competitions are fixed (Bergmann, 2024; Glassman, 2020). This suggests that once strength and power exceed a certain level, benefits of further improvements in these parameters might diminish. Contrastingly, the importance of muscular endurance (e.g., utilizing, tolerating, and clearing lactate) could become more prominent in order to sustain the repeated high-intensity efforts. In this context, it is worth mentioning that the various movements performed in Hyrox^\u00a9^ involve the upper as well as lower body musculature (Bergmann, 2024). It is therefore to assume, that both the transition between fatiguing upper-body-dominant as well as lower-body-dominant movements and running inhibits running performance and requires specific adaptions (e.g., redistribution of blood to the legs after movements involving large amounts of upper body musculature; running after high lactate accumulation in the legs due to lower-body-dominant movements). Running under such circumstances could have negatively affected running technique respectively economy which is highly relevant to achieve high running speeds. This could explain the relatively low running pace during the Hyrox^\u00a9^ compared to that observed in recreational half-marathon runners (Ogueta-Alday et al., 2018). Therefore, economizing the transition between different metabolic demands as well as maintaining efficient technical execution under fatigue seem to be important aspects for Hyrox^\u00a9^ athletes. This is in line with the findings of Peeling et al., who showed that swimming at too high an intensity has detrimental effects on subsequent cycling performance as well as overall performance in triathletes (Peeling et al., 2005). Similarly, Ribiero et al. reported lower overall performance in the CF workout \u201cFight Gone Bad\u201d when participants completed it in all-out pacing compared to a controlled-split pacing strategy (Ribeiro et al., 2024).\n\nIn comparison to endurance sports (e.g., running, cycling, rowing, swimming), Hyrox^\u00a9^ athletes need to excel in a greater variety of movement patterns and components of physical fitness (Bergmann, 2024). However, compared to CF, the degree of variation in terms of movements, distances, and loads, the technical demands appear to be relatively low (Bergmann, 2024; Glassman, 2020). This was also displayed by the fact that all participants were able to perform the movements according to Hyrox^\u00a9^ competition standards without any scaling. It can therefore be assumed that as performance level and technical proficiency increase, the optimization of metabolic adaptations and proper pacing becomes increasingly important for Hyrox^\u00a9^ athletes.\n\n### 4.2 Performance determinants\n\nThe correlation analyses were in line with the assumptions drawn from the observed physiological responses and RPE. Strong correlations with VO~2~max suggested that aerobic capacity could be an important performance determinant for Hyrox^\u00a9^ athletes. This was also evident in previous research investigating half-marathon runners as well as CF athletes (Meier et al., 2023a; Nikolaidis and Knechtle, 2023). The proximity to CF and running disciplines was further reflected in the strong correlations between the completion times of the Hyrox^\u00a9^ and runs with body fat percentage (Meier et al., 2023a; Nikolaidis and Knechtle, 2023). However, in contrast to CF, where measures of muscular strength were found to be important performance determinants, neither HGS nor muscle mass percentage correlated with performance in the present study (Meier et al., 2023a). This was also reflected in the lack of correlation between resistance training and completion times. On the other hand, endurance training volume was strongly associated with completion times of the Hyrox^\u00a9^ as well as the runs. However, more information regarding training parameters (e.g., volume, intensity, exercise selection, training history) would be required to better estimate the relevance of resistance and endurance training. Furthermore, only maximum HGS but no direct assessment of lower body strength or strength endurance was conducted.\n\n### 4.3 Training recommendations\n\nWhen training for a Hyrox^\u00a9^, a broad training strategy needs to be applied. According to the observations in the present study, endurance training should to be emphasized to perform a Hyrox^\u00a9^ at hard to very hard intensities. Hyrox^\u00a9^ training programs should therefore include endurance activities at moderate intensities as well as forms of HIIT to improve aerobic as well as anaerobic capacity. Since athletes spent the majority of time running, a substantial amount of training volume has to be dedicated to running-based training sessions. However, excessive running mileage has been shown to increase the injury risk and should be treated with caution (Fields et al., 2010). A strategy to avoid running-related overuse or injury would be to replace or combine running with other Hyrox^\u00a9^ specific endurance activities such as rowing or skiing (Bergmann, 2024). Infact, combining running with other Hyrox^\u00a9^ movements should be an integral part of Hyrox^\u00a9^ training to improve running economy in a pre-fatigued state and the ability to transition between different metabolic demands.\n\nAlthough strength appeared to be less important, athletes still need to be able to move external weights according to the competition standards. Previous research on CT indicated that endurance and resistance training may interfere with each other, affecting overall adaptations. To minimize interference, Methenitis recommended separating resistance and endurance training into distinct sessions. When endurance and resistance training have to be done in the same session, the most important aspect should be trained first. In case of athletes that substantially lack maximum strength, power, or muscular endurance to handle competition-standard loads, a training cycle focusing on resistance training could be utilized. For optimal resistance training adaptations, a ratio of 2:1 or 3:1 (resistance: endurance training) in terms of training frequency is recommended. On the other hand, optimal endurance training adaptions should be achieved with a ratio of 1:1 or 1:2 (resistance: endurance training) (Methenitis, 2018). Due to the high-intensity nature of Hyrox^\u00a9^, an efficient training method for Hyrox^\u00a9^ athletes should be HIIT as it effectively improves measures of endurance such as VO~2~max and leads to less interference effects compared with high-volume, moderate-intensity endurance training (Methenitis, 2018; Mallol et al., 2019). Furthermore, by incorporating Hyrox^\u00a9^ exercises and running within a HIIT-style endurance protocol, multiple training objectives could be achieved within a single session and thus minimize overall fatigue. Such training protocols would closely mirror the demands of a Hyrox^\u00a9^ competition, possibly enabling athletes to refine transitions between exercises, enhance movement efficiency, and adapt to the specific metabolic demands of Hyrox^\u00a9^. While findings of this study allowed for several general training recommendations, assessing individual capabilities and circumstances remains detrimental to design an effective, customized training program.\n\n### 4.4 Perspectives for practice and research\n\n#### 4.4.1 Health promotion\n\nAs a form of HIFT, Hyrox^\u00a9^ shows a significant overlap with the top recent fitness trends such as HIIT, FFT, and bodyweight training (Thompson, 2023). It is therefore to assume that its popularity will further increase. Besides the competitive execution of Hyrox^\u00a9^, it could also be attractive for health-oriented individuals. As outlined above, Hyrox^\u00a9^ training should include endurance training at moderate and high intensities as well as resistance training including all major muscle groups. Hyrox^\u00a9^ training therefore appears as an efficient way to meet the guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO) (Bull et al., 2020). The effectiveness of HIFT in terms of fitness and health (e.g., body composition, musculoskeletal, and cardiorespiratory fitness) has already been shown in previous studies (Claudino et al., 2018; Brandt et al., 2024; Bycura et al., 2017). Additionally, physical activity interventions based on Hyrox^\u00a9^, could benefit from positive motivational aspects that were found in other forms of HIFT such as CF indicating great potential for behavioral change and maintenance (Brandt et al., 2024; Bycura et al., 2017). The lower number and complexity of exercises compared to CF could further reduce barriers for participation in diverse populations with reduced physical capabilities (e.g., overweight and obese individuals, older adults, and those with physical impairments) (Winter and Gutman, 2022). Nevertheless, Hyrox^\u00a9^ still provides considerably more variation than other endurance activities (e.g., running, cycling, swimming) which has been reported to facilitate exercise participation among fitness practitioners (Winter and Gutman, 2022). Due to its similarity to CF, it is to assume that Hyrox^\u00a9^ participants also benefit from intrinsic motives such as enjoyment, challenge, and affiliation that support long-term adherence (Fisher et al., 2017). Furthermore, Hyrox^\u00a9^ offers different divisions with scaled competition standards, allowing participants of varying fitness levels and age groups to compete with each other (Bergmann, 2024). This does not only increase the accessibility of Hyrox^\u00a9^ for different populations, but might additionally results in levels of interest and enjoyment typically seen in sports (Frederick and Ryan, 1993).\n\n#### 4.4.2 Tactical populations\n\nAnother potential application area could be the training of tactical populations including soldiers, firefighters, and law enforcement personnel. These groups have to be prepared for a high variety of physical tasks such as dismounted patrols, casualty carry, or intensive combat situations while carrying heavy equipment. Hyrox^\u00a9^ could address the need for versatile fitness adaptions (e.g., strength, power, aerobic, and anaerobic capacity) in tactical populations and additionally teach movement patterns such as lifting, pulling, pushing, carrying, and throwing external loads that are common in mission tasks (Bergmann, 2024). Previous studies have already demonstrated the potential of HIFT for tactical populations. Haddock et al. concluded that HIFT modalities (e.g., CF, SEALFIT, US Marine Corps\u2019 High Intensity Tactical Training) provide several benefits such as improved conditioning and strength, general physical preparedness for unpredictable physical demands, less injury potential, low equipment costs, high scalability, and 25%\u201380% lower training volume compared to conventional military fitness training (Haddock et al., 2016).\n\n#### 4.4.3 Implications for future research\n\nWhile the present study provided a valuable foundation regarding the characteristics of Hyrox^\u00a9^, further research that builds on these results and addresses the limitations identified in this study is needed to gain a comprehensive understanding of this novel HIFT modality. Firstly, it is important to note that all but one participant in the present study demonstrated very good to excellent cardiorespiratory fitness levels based on their VO~2~max values (exception was one male participant showing good cardiorespiratory fitness) (Heyward, 2006). In terms of strength, again 8 participants showed above-average HGS for their age-group whereby only 3 male participants ranged slightly below-average (93.2%\u201399.6% of reference values) (Ewald and Kohler, 1991). This needs to be considered since physiological differences between athletes differing in experience or fitness level could affect performance and physiological responses (Mangine et al., 2020; Lorenz et al., 2013). Consequently, together with the small sample size, the generalizability of the present findings remains limited. To establish a more nuanced understanding of the characteristics of Hyrox^\u00a9^ across different fitness levels, future studies could include a larger, more heterogenous sample. An alternative approach might be to continue working with small sample sizes but homogeneous groups (e.g., only elite men or women), allowing for more distinct conclusions regarding the specific cohort, as was done by Mart\u00ednez-G\u00f3mez et al. and Sauv\u00e9 et al. for elite CF athletes (Sauv\u00e9 et al., 2024; Mart\u00ednez-G\u00f3mez et al., 2020). Furthermore, investigations should be extended to other Hyrox^\u00a9^ divisions besides the \u201cIndividual Open\u201d (e.g., Individual Pro, Doubles, Relay).\n\nFurther limiting factors of the present study were that each participant performed the Hyrox^\u00a9^ alone (no competitors or spectators), runs did not take place on a track, and the sled used differed from the official competition sled. Especially running on a competition-standard track could lead to different results. For instance, Peserico and Machado found lower running velocity and HR~avg~ but higher HR~max~ when participants ran 60 min on a treadmill compared to a track. Additionally, the authors reported differences in pacing strategies between the track and treadmill condition (Peserico and Machado, 2014). Similar results were confirmed in previous studies investigating shorter distances (Nummela et al., 2007; Morin and S\u00e8ve, 2011). In future studies, efforts should be made to replicate competition conditions more accurately or measure athletes during official competitions. To enhance the understanding of potential performance determinants, it is also recommended to expand the test battery with additional measurements. An effective method could be the determination of a total athleticism score, as recently proposed by Tibana et al. in the context of CF. The authors calculated the score based on body fat percentage, VO~2~max, muscle power, and muscle endurance providing a holistic measure for overall athleticism (Tibana et al., 2024). A similar tool could be developed and applied in Hyrox^\u00a9^, incorporating Hyrox-specific movements and accessible tests (e.g., the critical speed test). Lastly, the potential effectiveness of Hyrox^\u00a9^ in terms of health-promotion and tactical training has not been confirmed yet and must be investigated in future studies. In this context, future research should focus not only on fitness and health adaptions but also on motivational aspects, the potential for behavioral change and maintenance, training time and volume, costs, equipment requirements, injury prevalence as well as the applicability across various settings (e.g., commercial gyms, workplace health promotion, military bases, and during deployments abroad).\n\n## 5 Conclusion\n\nHyrox^\u00a9^ is an endurance-focused form of HIFT that combines running with 8 different functional movements. Performing a Hyrox^\u00a9^ required athletes to engage both aerobic as well as anaerobic metabolic pathways and to transition between varying metabolic demands depending on the executed movement. Participants spent the majority of the Hyrox^\u00a9^ running whereas the intensity according to HR, BL, and RPE values was higher during the exercise stations. Although endurance capacity respectively training appeared to be of greater importance for performance than measures of strength, individual weaknesses should be considered to design effective and sustainable training programs. In this regard, it is suggested to apply CT training recommendations (Methenitis, 2018). Despite the limitations of this first Hyrox^\u00a9^ study and the need for further investigations, Hyrox^\u00a9^ has emerged as a form of HIFT likely to gain further popularity and offering practical applications beyond its competitive nature, including health promotion and tactical population training.\n\n## Data availability statement\n\nThe datasets presented in this article are not readily available because The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

Host: Andrew Huberman (@hubermanlab)\n\n**The Importance Of Having A Training Program** **The two main reasons people don\u2019t see results from their fitness program**are (1) adherence and (2) lack of progressive overload \u2013 both of which are difficult to achieve without a training plan\n\n- Have a loose tracking system, like a notebook, you can track weights used so you can dial up\n\n**\u201cConstruct a plan that lives within your realistic limitations.\u201d** *\u2013 Dr. Andy Galpin*\n\n**10-Step Approach To Designing A Training Program \u2013 Step 1: Define Your Training Goal** **Define your training goal**\u2013 when you leave your house, ideally you know the optimal route to your destination\n\n- Arbitrarily choose something or understand your largest deficit and focus on that\n\n- Follow\n\n**SMART goal setting**: specific (be as specific as possible), measurable (objective measure), attainable (something within your control), realistic (set balance of stretch and reality, think about 10% improvement), time-sensitive (give yourself time constraints)\n\n- A note about intermediate goals: be specific about goal and time domain ahead of time so you can track progress over time\n\n- Progress isn\u2019t always linear: don\u2019t tether the system only to exact numbers\n\n**\u201cThe more specific and precise you can be with a single goal, the faster you will get there.\u201d** *\u2013 Dr. Andy Galpin*\n\n- Some combinations of goals are compatible but some will distract from the primary goal \u2013 for example, you can optimize speed and power together but you\u2019d be less successful at optimizing hypertrophy and strength at the same time\n\n**Recall the 9 main training adaptions \u2013 the closer they are to each other on the list, the more compatible they are:**skill, speed, power (function of speed and strength), strength, hypertrophy (growing muscle mass), muscular endurance, anaerobic power (ability to produce and sustain work in short bursts), VO2 max (max heart rate), long-endurance (30+ minutes with no break)\n\n- You can have performance-based goals \u2013 athletes don\u2019t lift weights because that\u2019s their goal, with specificity it makes them better at their sport\n\n- Example: Instead of \u201cI want to get stronger\u201d think \u2013 \u201cI want to be able to run this 2-mile loop around my neighborhood faster and/or with a lower heart rate\u201d\n\n- Be realistic about what\u2019s hindered you before (such as injuries, loss of interest, etc.) and address that thing and adjust accordingly\n\n**Step 2: Identify Your Defender** **Get real about limitations \u2013 imagine everything in your life falls into one of four quadrants:**business, relationships, fitness, recovery \u2013 distribute 10 total points across the four areas **Quadrant example:**business 5, relationships 2, fitness 2, recovery 1 \u2013 this means you spend 2.5x more time on the business than relationships, and so on\n\n- Recovery needs to be a minimum of half of the fitness allocation (shoot for 20% of the total)\n\n- Consider recovery as things that give you energy back, not just muscle rest days\n\n- Break it all down \u2013 is this the optimal split for you? Is 2 out of 10 sufficient to hit your fitness goals?\n\n- Implement the \u201cDrop everything and \u2018blank\u2019\u201d rule (e.g., drop everything and read for recovery) \u2013 then print it and put it in the place you fail for and in the hands of someone who will keep you accountable\n\n**Step 3: Goal Timeline & Step 4: Weekly Training Frequency** **Work training backward around life or you will fail**\u2013 it\u2019s not always realistic to exercise 90 minutes per day, 5 days per week **Choose the number of days per week and length you can exercise based on the reality of your calendar**\n\n**Step 5: Exercise Selection Program** **Before you even worry about exercise selection:**think about where you want to go, how you\u2019re going to get there, and restrictions based on the reality of life, lastly select exercises and balance across the week **Checklist for progressive overload:**(1) make sure you can do the exercise perfectly with assistance (e.g., box squat); (2) make sure you can do the movement without assistance (e.g., air squat); (3) assess whether you can do the movement well with added load in eccentric position (e.g., goblet squat); (4) can you hold an eccentric position with a load while maintaining control (e.g., goblet squat, hold the bottom); (5) now you can add speed; and (6) go to fatigue\n\n- The progression checklist might take you one session or two years\n\n**\u2013**it doesn\u2019t have to be a fixed timeline depending on experience\n\n- The progression checklist might take you one session or two years\n\n**Step 6: Exercise Order** **Do what\u2019s most important first in the workout**\u2013 maybe it\u2019s a muscle group or specific lift you want to maximize\n\n- This requires going through steps 1-4 so you know what the priority is no matter the circumstances\n\n- Things might get more chaotic as the week goes on, maybe choose the most demanding workout or movement on Mondays if you can be more consistent\n\n- It might be difficult to do a hard workout by Friday night \u2013 create a plan accordingly and maybe do something like biceps/triceps or whatever feels easier for you\n\n**Bookend the day you can anticipate having your best day and worst day and plan accordingly**\n\n**Step 7: Intensity/Load & Step 8: Volume** **Consistency always beats intensity**\n\n- Try to exercise at least 4-6 hours prior to sleep\n\n- If you can\u2019t, finish with down-regulation breathing to slow down heart rate and relax mentally\n\n- Athletes, you do need to train at the same time you will play/compete\n\n- Note: 30 minutes of total zone 5 exercise per week positively impacts deep sleep as long as it\u2019s done early in the day far apart from sleep time\n\n**Remember the adaptation you\u2019re training for**(see previous episodes) **and pick the appropriate rep range, total sets, and intensity to get the corresponding adaptation** **Intensity:**shoot for 3% progression per week **Volume:**shoot for about 5% progression per week and no more than 10% **Progressive overload can come in the form of any modifiable variable:**intensity, load, volume, time under tension, number of sessions per day, rest intervals **Increase load or intensity for 6 weeks then take a de-load week**\u2013 this should leave you progressing well and avoiding injury **Programming reminders:** **Strength:**3-5 exercises, 3-5 repetitions, 3-5 sets, 3-5x per week, rest 3-5 minutes **Hypertrophy:**10-20 sets per muscle group, anywhere 6-30 reps getting close to failure, per week \u2013 in a single session or multiple sessions as long as you hit volume\n\n\n\n**Step 9: Rest Intervals** **Higher rest intervals (2-5 minutes) for speed, power, and strength; endurance rest intervals vary depending on the type of training**\n\n- Block programming in 4-8 week chunks, backing off one week for a de-load before resuming\n\n**Step 10: Chaos Management** **Think ahead:**come up with possible places of failure or friction before you start so you can address and make adjustments in advance\n\n- Maybe it\u2019s an exercise, maybe the calendar isn\u2019t realistic, etc.\n\n- Outline what you want to do then take a day to think about it\n\n**Sample One-Year Program** **General goals of exercise:**(1) look a certain way; (2) perform a certain way; (3) do that across the lifespan **Physical fitness parameters for both lifespan and healthspan:**grip strength, leg strength, total muscle mass, speed and power, VO2 max, physical fitness\n\n- Importance of proprioception in staving off neurodegenerative disease: work on balance to improve awareness of where you are in space \u2013 you can get this from sport, deliberate work, trial running, etc. shooting for one workout per week\n\n**Sample structure training program for the year:**\n\n- Q1 you want to add muscle and work on sleep (hypertrophy)\n\n- Increase calories by 10-15% for bulk\n\n- 7 sessions per week of physical activity (not necessarily 7 days, could be a combination of walking, sports, lifting)\n\n- Lift weights 4x per week + outside time when you can\n\n- Focus on sleeping more, critical to recovering and growing muscle \u2013 this helps because days are darker\n\n- Q2 you want to lean out\n\n- Bring calories down \u2013 this plays into life because you\u2019re more likely to be at social events, at the beach, in the sun, etc.\n\n- Days are longer, shoot for outdoor sports like paddleboarding, kayaking, and walking 2x per week\n\n- Fitness or exercise class 2x per week (take the pressure of programming off and enjoy the benefits of group dynamic) + 2x per week lifting\n\n- Q3 get into great cardiovascular shape (higher heart rate training)\n\n- Maintenance calories\n\n- Choose outdoor sports 2x/week\n\n- Include track workouts, hill sprints, etc. 2x per week\n\n- Lift 2x per week\n\n- Q4 pure cardiovascular fitness (moderate to long-form, aerobic capacity)\n\n- Increase calories (which works out through holidays and cold weather \u2013 this plays well into life)\n\n- Transition back into indoor sports like kickboxing, martial arts, etc. 2x per week\n\n- Hit machines or lift 1x per week\n\n- Indoor cardio machines or walk outside if you can 2x per week\n\n**At the end of every quarter, take one week\u2019s rest or de-load the week**\n\n- If you want to run fitness testing, target 3\n\nrdweek of December\n\n- You can easily adjust the programming based on what matters to you, and what comes up in life, and use this template repeatedly\n\n**The variety will keep you engaged and give you the flexibility to choose what you enjoy which makes adherence easier**\n\n- Q1 you want to add muscle and work on sleep (hypertrophy)\n\n**Sample Training Program: 3 Exercise Sessions Per Week**\n\n- General 3-day schedule \u2013 can be in and out of the gym in under 60 minutes or less as fits your schedule:\n\n- Day 1: speed and power finished with hypertrophy\n\n- Training speed and power first won\u2019t hinder hypertrophy\n\n- Day 2: pure strength than higher heart rate (aerobic or anaerobic getting high heart rate)\n\n- Day 3: steady state, long-duration endurance\n\n- Day 1: speed and power finished with hypertrophy\n\n- Either totally off or active recovery on days off\n\n**Important reminder:**you will not hit optimal health by engaging in intense physical activity for 1 hour per day than sitting around the other hours of the day\n\n- For longer program (i.e., 6 days), cycle this format\n\n**Sample Training Program: 4 Exercise Sessions Per Week**\n\n- General 4-day schedule\n\n- Day 1: full body multi-joint exercises, strength training, staying in a 5-10 rep range\n\n- Day 2: long-duration exercise \u2013 could be a swim, sport, jog, etc.\n\n- If you\u2019re feeling good it can be harder and longer; if you\u2019re fatigued it can be slower and shorter\n\n- Day 3: 11-30 rep range lifting or muscular endurance bodyweight or yoga training where you will get muscular burn but it\u2019s light\n\n- Group activity or spin could be good and finish with light upper body\n\n- Day 4: medium intensity \u2013 could be boxing, bike intervals at moderate heart rate \u2013 then finish with 5-6 minutes of max heart rate work\n\n- Example: solid 10-minute warm-up at moderate pace on bike then 30-second faster bursts on the bike then cool down on the bike\n\n**How To Adjust Training For Illness & Fatigue**\n\n- One bad night of sleep: it depends on the phase of training \u2013 if you are trying to push adaptation and make progress, train\n\n- If it\u2019s close to a de-load week, give yourself recovery \u2013 this could be a sauna, restorative exercise\n\n- Hot water immersion, if you\u2019re ill, might be restorative as well\n\n- Cold exposure can increase stress negatively when you\u2019re run down\n\n- Soreness and time to recover can hinder the ability to train again \u2013 recovery is important\n\n- Full recovery episode coming next!\n\n**Resources**\n\n- Guest Series | Dr. Andy Galpin: How to Assess & Improve All Aspects of Your Fitness\n\n- 3-Day Training Program (XPT)\n\n- Chart of Interference\n\n- 10-Step Approach to Designing a Training Program\n\n",

I'm Andrew Hubertman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today's episode is the fifth in a six-episode series on fitness exercise and performance. And today's episode is all about recovery. That is how to maximize your recovery to achieve your fitness and exercise and performance goals and how to avoid over training. Dr. Indy Gelpin, great to be back. Today we're discussing recovery, and I'm very excited to have this discussion because as we know, despite the fact that different types of exercise can be used to trigger different types of adaptation, such as increased long distance, endurance, anaerobic capacity, strength, hypertrophy,\n\net cetera. The workouts themselves are not actually when the progress occurs, when the adaptation occurs. And this, to me, is extremely interesting because it parallels what we see with so-called neuroplasticity, which is the nervous system's ability to change in response to experience. We sit down to learn something. We experience something and that is the trigger for rewiring of the nervous system, but the actual rewiring occurs away from the experience or the learning.\n\nSo to in fitness and in exercise, recovery is where the real results actually emerge, where we get better. So, I'd love for you to explain what recovery really is and the different types of recovery, certainly different ways to enhance recovery. And I'd also love for you to explain whether or not there are ways that people can become better at recovering, because if indeed recovery is when progress emerges, when we get better,\n\nwell, then anything that supports our recovery and gets us better at recovering ought to increase our rate and our degree of progress. Absolutely. You nailed it in the description. What people really want is some sort of change. Whether you were talking athletes or general population, this change is some sort of improvement in muscle function, reduction in body fat, higher functioning metabolism,\n\nwhatever the case is. And the only way that happens is we talk about the equation of stress causes adaptation, but as you alluded to, the piece in the middle is only if you can recover from it. And so the game we're playing here is we all agree we want more adaptation. That means we need to bring more stress in the system. But we then have to ensure that our recovery outpaces\n\nthe stress input, or else we will know adaptation will occur. In fact, what happens is you will actually be a negative spot and start going backwards. And so what I would love to do is talk about how we've handled this. And I've had a decent amount of experience here. I was fortunate enough to do my master's degree in the laboratory of a gentleman named Andy Fry, who is an NSCA Lifetime Achievement Award winner. And he studied in large part recovery, overtraining, overuse,\n\noverload, and a lot of areas. In addition, I've been fortunate enough to work with individuals from high-functioning CEOs and executives who have little time for recovery, high job stress to athletes. I think of the example of pictures in Major League Baseball, who have to recover in a matter of four days so that they can pitch again at maximum velocity. So I would love to outline some of the tools and tactics strategies that we use for all these individuals, give you some foundational stuff. And I would love to maybe actually cover some things that most people have never heard of. Some stuff you may not have access to some technologies that we use, some\n\nbiomarkers, and then even a whole bunch of things that are keeping with the theme of your show here, cost-free or extremely low cost. So, all those strategies, what I would also like to do is cover nutrition, supplementation, and fueling and hydration and things, but that's probably going to have to be saved for an additional conversation that we'll do in the next episode. Yes, so we will absolutely hold a conversation about nutrition and supplementation, where you can educate us about all the top contour stuff, all the way down to the fine details. I do have a question about recovery, and it's one that I think most people are familiar with themselves, which is soreness. We think of it as a muscle soreness, but I was trained early on in my scientific career to always question\n\nthe seemingly obvious. So a couple of questions about soreness. First of all, what does soreness really reflect? Is it really muscle soreness? It feels like it's in the muscles. But what other organ systems and tissues and cell types does it involve? And then I'm particularly interested in this concept or this experience that many of us, including myself, had, which is delayed on-set muscle soreness. Why would it be that when we are less in shape or when we perform a movement that is extremely novel to us? The soreness seems to arrive after a reasonable delay of maybe even a day. We'll find the next day, but then 48 hours later we are exceedingly sore.\n\nAnd as we get more fit or more familiar with the movement, the soreness seems to arrive earlier. So I realize I just asked you about three questions or more. First of all, what is muscle soreness at a cell or level, which cells, which organ systems, and so forth. What does it mean if we are sore is something I know we'll get into a little bit later. And then why the delayed onset muscle soreness? It's actually one question. So it's totally fine. You answered all three. Because I'm going to actually answer number three, which will answer number two, which will actually answer number one. I'd love to tell you that I set it up that way intentionally, but I'm just happy to hear that where I was unable to be concise. You are able to be concise. Thank you. We are still learning a lot\n\nabout this area. It's actually really difficult to perform these studies. Any time you ask a question about something like pain or soreness, you're immediately talking about perception. And there is obviously a physical component to that, and there's also perception. And so teasing those things out is extraordinarily challenging. That said, there has been a lot of work in this area. In fact, probably you may have a chill already out on pain, or maybe once coming down the road. We did an episode on pain a while ago, but it's definitely time to revisit that literature. I also have some amazing colleagues at Stanford who work on pain both from the cellular and molecular side, but also from the psychological side, about how our understanding of pain and what we believe about pain shapes our understanding of pain and what we believe\n\nabout pain shapes the experience of pain and pain relief. Amazing. That stuff is incredibly important. And I'm glad we flag that and maybe we'll just call that good for now. They can come back later for another one of your shows. So that being said, why does it happen 28 to 48 hours after you exercise? Well, that actually should give you some clues into what's happening. So the traditional dogma of delayed onset muscle soreness is what this is called is that it is a result of quote unquote micro\n\ntears in the muscle and so you can sort of think I challenged the muscle. There were some small tears in there and I'm feeling the result to that. Well, in fact that certainly happen, and it can happen. That is not what's explaining your muscle soreness. And in fact, you can be quite sore from exercise and have no measurable amount of muscle damage. And so much like anything else who are in this idea of pain, it's not a one-to-one explanation. There are multiple factors that are probably causing your perception of pain. Muscle damage can be one of them.\n\nIt is not the only one. And it is probably, in my opinion, though this is yet to be shown definitively, probably not even the leading cause of it. And so what's actually happening? Well, the reason it's taking you 24 to 48 hours is you can actually find various papers, literature reviews, dating back in a number of years now, over a decade, that show these\n\nwonderful curves of an inflammatory and immune response. And we don't need to necessarily go through the entire physiology right now. But effectively what's happening is those things have a little bit of a time delay. And so some of those steps happening immediately, like right when the exercise is there, and then some of them are delayed six to 24 to 48 hours. If you know a little bit about this physiology, it's, you have a combination of neutrophils and macrophages\n\nand a bunch of things happening, and this says a time sequence. So what happens is by the time we get to this 28 to 48 hour window, now the muscle soreness kicks in, which wait a minute, if I, if this was a result of my muscles being torn and that happened immediately, wouldn't that pain start immediately? Well, the answer is it would. And so that, that is your first clue that that's not responsible for it. When we look at that immune response and we see that that is actually peak 24 to 48 hours later. And then that's the same time the pain kicked in. That's killing you into the problem. So we have this immune response and we see that that is actually peak 24 to 48 hours later. And then that's the same time the pain kicked in.\n\nThat's killing you with the problem. So we have this immune response happening in inflammation. Then all of a sudden we start getting fluid accumulation. And now there are what are called nosy-septors and you're probably very, obviously you're very familiar with these and these are your pain receptors. What's actually interesting is we don't necessarily know a lot of information about how many pain receptors are in muscle. They're not really in the belly.\n\nIn fact, this is why I can perform my muscle biopsies and they don't really hurt. You mean in the belly of the muscle? Correct. We do have pressure sensors, though. And so if you change the volume of the tissue, you will respond to that very, very quickly. So by enhancing swelling in the actual muscle, that is immediately putting pressure on those pressure receptors, if you will. That's the signal.\n\nSo what's probably happening here, and I just hate to give you another bone, but a lot of delayed on some muscle soreness is probably just a neural feedback loop, rather than it is actual muscle damage. Makes a lot of sense. There's a lot of interactions between the types of neurons that control touch sensation and pain sensation and itch sensation. In fact, a lot of people kind of collapse itch\n\nand pain together. Pingo. You know, that's something it's painful and itches is a familiar thing for people, mosquito bites and such. And then, of course, there's the classic gate theory of pain, which people will be familiar with. And then I'll explain why I'm explaining this, which is if you, you, you, something hurts, you know, you, you bonk your knee or you stub your toe, we tend to grab that body part and try and rub it. Totally. And that rubbing is not a coincidental thing. It activates a set of touch sensors that are that respond to kind of broad dull touch. And that actively inhibits through the release of an inhibitory neurotransmitter, the fibers that control the pain signal.\n\nSo anytime we rub a, you know, like a Charlie Horse or leg or we stub our toe and we, you know, we rinse and then we grab the toe and we get like squeezing in a little bit. That's actually deactivating or partially inactivating the pain mechanism. So the idea that a swelling response would then trigger a neural response that then would recruit the pain receptor response. You're I'm using broad, broad, broad strokes here to explain this makes very good sense to me. Now and only now that you've explained how this process works, I can\n\nactually even add more to that. So if you remember how muscles work, so we have to have some sort of signal from the nervous system that has to actually go in and tell the muscle to contract. We'll remember a few episodes ago, we covered the physiology here of what's called the motor unit. Well, what I didn't explain to are called muscle spindles.\n\nAnd we have talked about proprioception in an episode of before as well. But we never tied this picture together. So let me walk you through that really quickly, and it's going to tie this loop into a nice bow. So what happens is this motor unit is coming in from what's called an alpha motor unit, and that's going to be innovating your muscle fibers, and that's going to tell the muscle fibers to contract. Those are typically spread out throughout the all sides of the muscle, interior exterior all over. On the outside though, there is another type of muscle called a muscle spindle.\n\nThese are non-contractile, so they don't have that actin and myosin and they don't produce force. They are responsive, they are proprioceptive. What that means is they sense stretch. This is why, for example, if you were to stretch a hamstring, and stretch any muscle grip, it doesn't really matter or muscle, it's innate response is to fire back to close that distance. And this is what keeps you from say,\n\nif you're leaning to the right, you can imagine that the example we give is, if you're standing on one foot and you start swaying to the right, all right, let's say you're standing on your right foot and this makes this easier for folks. And you start swaying to the right, like you're gonna follow on your right ear, we'll hit the ground. The inside of your right foot, and this makes it easier for folks. And you start swaying to the right. Like you're gonna follow on your right ear,\n\nwe'll hit the ground. The inside of your right calf muscle will start being stretched. The outside will start being compressed, right? So the stretch on the inside of the right calf muscle will sense that stretch, and it will respond by contracting that pulls you back to the middle and stops you from falling. That's proprioception, and muscle spindles sense stretch and tell you to contract.\n\nThe way that they work is through gamma motor neurons. And so these are sensory things. So what's happening is, unlike when you tell your muscle to contract, it goes alpha to the muscle contract. These muscle spindles work so that it is, oh, I've been stretched, send signal back to some central point, typically in this spinal cord, and we don't actually want to go all the way up to the brain. We've got a time delay.\n\nThis is why these are subconscious, autonomic, right? Or, versus somatic. So the gamma is going to go back to the central location and then come back through the alpha motor neurons until it took contract. So you have those wonderful mechanism of sensing stretch going back. Well, one theory that's been put forward regarding muscle damage is that the pressure is actually being applied to those nerve endings of the muscle spindles. And that's actually responsible for the pain signal that's going back and coming up to your brain and you're registering that\n\nis pain rather than it is actually in the contract-all units, so the muscle fibers. That's a very intriguing idea because it would suggest that stretching muscles in order to alleviate soreness might be the exact incorrect thing to do. Now, I'm not saying that's for certain. I'm just building off the mechanistic logic that we've laid out here. Yeah. Really that you've laid out here. There is a more effective principle based on exactly that, which is this is what generally why low level movement is effective at reducing acute soreness. And because that's low level contraction of\n\nthe muscles and you're going to stretch and get tissue out and you can get fluid out. Wow. You're literally pumping it out of the cell. Yes.'re going to get stretched and get tissue out and you can get fluid out. Wow. You're literally pumping it out of the cell. Yes, and in our previous episode, where we were talking about programming, we're confusing the Wii, but let's be fair here, where you were educating us, including me, in the audience about different structures for programming, exercise for specific adaptations, et cetera, the month, week, year scales, et cetera. We had a brief discussion about the fact that if one trains legs very hard with resistance training, you know, some heavy squatting or deadlifting it, and there's some soreness that oftentimes doing some quote-unquote lighter cardio or some low impact work the next day,\n\nor any number of different things that involve not high intensity contractions of the muscles, but that do require contractions of the muscles that it can alleviate soreness more quickly than if one were to simply lie around and watch an Netflix or something. Yeah, that's exactly right. The, to go back just a little bit as well, if one word, it simply lie around and watching Netflix or something. Yeah, that's exactly right. To go back just a little bit as well, if that's really the case, the question is, where\n\nis this inflammatory signal coming from? And while there's much to be learned there, there is a little bit of information right now that suggests it's potentially coming from free radicals released from the mitochondria. Again, that may or may not hold up as more research comes. I'm not sure. But if you remember back to our conversation on endurance, so we talked about the electron transport chain and a road with metabolism, regardless of whether you're not getting energy from glycolysis or carbohydrates. Remember, they have to be finished through a roadobic metabolism. So even if you're lifting weights and you're using carbs for your fuel, you have got to finish that metabolism by running it into the mitochondria and performing oxidative metabolism as a result of that electron transport chain runs.\n\nSo theoretically, if free radicals, which are hyperreactive oxygen species, basically, they're oxygen molecules that are missing an electron so that they react to a lot of things. They're the opposite of antioxidants, by the way. This is, you know, the oxygen molecule is with extra protons so they can balance the charge. If those leak out, that in and of itself is going to be a massive inflammatory signal\n\nand that's probably what signals the cause of these neutrophils and macrophages and kicks off this entire cascade. Again, I believe we need more research there. I need to look into it. Maybe it's more definitive than I know. But that's probably what's happening, potentially what's happening rather, that causes that cascade in signal. Also, what you have is this combination of, well, if that's the case, why am I not getting tremendous amount of muscle damage when I do more aerobic based exercise? Well because you don't have the mechanical tension pulling on the fibers that's actually\n\ncausing damage to the cell wall that allows these free radicals to escape the mitochondria and the cell wall. So that's the best we can postulate at this moment as to why those things are happening. And then why, again, low-level exercise tends to enhance even things like percussion. So using either instruments that put a low level of vibration in your leg or like pneumatic boots so you massage all these things are generally probably helping because they're moving that stuff out, a demon most specifically. So pressure comes off of those nerve endings in the muscle spindles and allows you to stop receiving that signal of pain,\n\ndespite the fact that you didn't actually regenerate tissue at all yet. Fascinating. And I think that beautifully frames where we're headed next, which is to talk about all the different modes of recovery and how to accelerate them and perhaps even how to combine different forms of recovery in order to become\n\nbetter at recovering and in doing so, make faster progress with fitness. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is also separate from Dr. Andy Galpins teaching and researchers at Cal State Fullerton. It is, however, part of our desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, we'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.\n\nOur first sponsor is Momentus. Momentus makes supplements of the absolute highest quality. The Hubertman Lab podcast is proud to be partnering with Momentus for several important reasons. First of all, as I mentioned, their supplements are of extremely high quality, second of all. Their supplements are generally in single ingredient formulations. If you're going to develop a supplementation protocol, you're going to want to focus mainly on using single ingredient formulations. With single ingredient formulations, you can devise the most logical and effective and cost effective supplementation regimen for your goals.\n\nIn addition, momentous supplement ship internationally. And this is, of course, important because we realized that many of the Hubertman Lab podcasts listeners reside outside the United States. If you'd like to try the various supplements mentioned on the Hubertman Lab podcast, in particular supplements for hormone health, for sleep optimization, for focus, as well as a number of other things, including exercise recovery, you can go to LivMomentus spelled OUS, so that LivMomentus.com slash Huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.\n\nElement is an electrolyte drink that contains the exact ratios of the electrolyte sodium, magnesium, and potassium to optimize cellar functioning for mental and physical performance. Most people realize that hydration is key. We need to ingest enough fluids in order to feel our best and perform our best. But what most people do not realize is that the proper functioning of our cells and nerve\n\ncells, neurons in particular, requires that sodium magnesium and potassium be present in the correct ratios. Now of course, people with prehypertension and hypertension need to be careful about their sodium intake. But what a lot of people don't realize is that if you drink caffeine, if you exercise, and in particular, if you're falling a very clean diet, that is not a lot of processed foods,\n\nwhich, of course, is a good thing. Chances are you're not getting enough sodium, potassium, and magnesium to optimize mental and physical performance. Element contains a science-backed ratio of 1,000 milligrams, that's one gram of sodium, potassium, and magnesium to optimize mental and physical performance. Element contains a science-backed ratio of 1,000 milligrams, that's 1 gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium, and no sugar.

Today's episode is also brought to us by\n\n8Sleep. 8Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity. I've been using an 8Sleep mattress cover for about the last 8 months and it has completely transformed my sleep. I'm sleeping about the same amount but I'm sleeping far deeper and I'm now getting the proper ratios of so-called rapid eye movement or REM sleep and slow wave sleep and waking up feeling far more recovered mentally and physically. The underlying mechanism for all that is very straightforward. I've talked many times before on this podcast and elsewhere about the critical relationship\n\nbetween sleep and body temperature. That is, in order to fall asleep at night, your body needs to drop by about one to three degrees in terms of core body temperature and waking up involves a one to three degree increase in core body temperature. With eight sleep mattress covers, you can adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment to be one temperature at the start of the night, a different temperature, the middle of the night, and a different temperature as you approach morning. Each of which can place you into the optimal stages of sleep and have you waking up feeling more refreshed than ever.\n\nIf you'd like to try AIDS sleep, you can go to 8sleep.com slash Huberman and check out their pod three cover and save $150 at checkout. 8sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, United Kingdom, select countries in the EU and Australia.

So to kick off this discussion about recovery and with the understanding that recovery is when the specific adaptations to exercise actually occur. I'd love for\n\nyou to share with us what happens or needs to happen during recovery in order for us to get better at anything endurance, strength, et cetera. But also how specific types of exercise in order for us to get better at anything endurance, strength, etc. But also how specific types of exercise stimuli and specific types of adaptations that we trigger, so running a bit further, lifting a bit more weight, slowing the cadence of a given movement, etc. How those specific types of triggers for adaptation relate to the specific or maybe similar types of recovery that are required for us to make progress. And one of our previous episodes we were talking about how the Harvard fatigue lab really\n\nidentified this idea of homeostasis, or at least sort of championed it for it. And that's important because, and all levels, physiology wants to return to homeostasis. So what happens in terms of adaptation is you've challenged it to a level that it realizes if it does not make a change, it will not be able to get back to the same level of homeostasis. That's fundamentally what's happening.\n\nThat is recovery, that process of taking an insult, being temporarily reduced in functionality, causing a change so that now we come back and get what we often call in support performance, super compensation. All that really is doing though is bringing you to a new level of homeostasis. Effectively, it is understanding if that same insult comes again, I need to be able to make sure that that doesn't cause the same level of disruption. And so we raise the bar, whether this is enhancing our ability to take the same level of mechanical tension on the muscle and not result in micro damage, whether this is being able to take\n\nthe same reduction in energy and not have that compromise of sleep or anything. It's really fundamentally changing so we can have a new level of homeostasis because it's presuming it's predicting that that same insult is going to come again down the road. I wanted to clarify for people that when Dr. Galbun says insult, while he may actually insult me, insult is the nerd-speak terminology for some sort of damage inflicted to a tissue or system. So he's speaking about the insult to the muscle or insult to the neuromuscular connection created by adding\n\nmore weight to the bar, running a further distance, running a bit faster, or pedaling faster, that creates a micro-insulter and insult. And now, because everyone is familiar with psychological and verbal insults, you'll never forget that biological concept. It's important to be tagging another thing here, which is called Hormesis.\n\nIt's one of my favorite phenomenon, and it effectively means this, that there is a dosage or toxicity response to almost everything. And if you think about this in the context of, say, drugs, what this means is, if I gave you 10 milligrams of something, that it would be okay. But if I gave you 20, it'd be a problem. And eventually, if I go up and give you enough, this thing turns toxic.\n\nThis is a case of everything from cyanide, where it can actually be in small dosages in nature. In fact, it's in many of the fruits that you eat. But it's at a dosage that it doesn't matter. If that dosage gets higher, though, that actually can cause problems. And if it is high enough, it can actually kill you in stentanacy. The back end of that, though, is because you\n\nintroduce this microinsult, as you frame it for me, perfectly, your body will then adapt to it. And that's really what's happening with exercise adaptation. It is a hermetic stressor. And why that's important is, if you look at the immediate responses to exercise, you see an extremely large increase in inflammation.\n\nYou see oxidative stress. You see a whole cascade of etophagy. Like all these problems, quote unquote, happened, and it's actually quite funny here is, as a part of my PhD, the academic portion I had to go through the medical side of the school. And so I was, my physiology class was in med school. So I'm the only non medical doctor in that class, right, in my PhD. So I leave my lab, I walk across campus and I take physiology class with these folks. And I died the whole time internally\n\nbecause every time we would cover a new area, it was basically the exact same value or number. And a medical setting is like, oh my gosh, they're going to die. And in a performance setting is like this person's in fantastic shape. I've never, it still amuses me to this day obviously because it's just simple things like total blood volume, right? And you'd cover like, okay, if you have a patient come in, their blood volume to six liters, you know, immediately get them on a diuretic of some sort, because they're gonna have a heart attack\n\nas blood pressure gets up right now. I'm immediately thinking, damn, six liters, that dead person is super fit. Because that is actually a positive adaptation to training. It's one of the most important, if not the most important adaptation to endurance training is enhanced total blood volume. So you'll store more blood in your body when you're more fit than you are less fit.\n\nSo I'm gonna go on, all these things, sodium concentrations, potassium concentrations, you look at these things on paper and you don't know if that person is about to die because they're 65 years old and out of shape or if that person is going to break a world record in their marathon. This brings up a very important tangent, which is, for instance, if you go and take a blood test and you are somebody who exercises very intensely with resistance training, your blood creatinine levels can be way out of range. And if your physician doesn't know that you're doing certain forms of exercise might say,\n\nwow, there's a lot of muscle tissue damage occurring in your body. As you mentioned before, your total blood volume is dangerously high. When, in fact, you are far healthier and indeed much fitter than the person who as numbers would be in range. That said, obviously, there are limits to these statements whereby you would want to be cautious and take action to ameliorate a very elevated blood creatinine level or something of that sort. But the point you're bringing up is also one about the field of medicine, which is that many, not all, but many physicians don't take into consideration the outside activities\n\nthat people are doing. And so it becomes a kind of plug-in play type way of looking at blood charts. We've done many thousand athletes blood chemistry and we don't use, first of all, we never look at disease stuff that's not what we do. We take people that are healthy and try to optimize performance and blood chemistry is one of the best tools. If you really understand what you're doing there, you can get some incredibly\n\npowerful information out of blood chemistry. That actually relates to what we're going to talk to today in terms of measuring everything from acute to chronic dehydration to sleep deprivation can be identified in blood chemistry to optimization improvements in nutrition supplementation. There's a lot you can get there. I mean, if people are interested in that field, I'd point them to a gentleman named Dan Garner, who's just an absolute juggernaut and wizard and blood chemistry for high performance. But you can get a ton of information from that,\n\nbut if you understand the difference between exactly what you talked about, looking for signals of increased risk of cardiovascular events 25 years down the road, versus is this the optimal value for high performance in an athlete, which is what our database and all of our software and stuff does is only looking for those things. So I'm going to talk about some of the biomarkers to look for a little bit later, salivary stuff, some blood stuff, but we'll maybe save that conversation for down the road. Tell me about different time scales of recovery.\n\nSure, this is actually where I was trying to answer your question for and then I got for down the road. Tell me about different timescales of recovery. Sure. This is actually where I was trying to answer your question for and then I got myself way off track. But the reason I brought up the hermetic thing is if you understand that some things in the acute, say, 24 to 48 hour period, look terrible. It's actually fine, right? So this is the stimuli that's causing adaptation. So the reason I brought up the medical exchange there is\n\nbecause if you looked at inflammatory markers and then you mentioned some of them, you would see that they are highest acute within seconds to minutes to hours after exercise. However, that's exactly the stimuli needed to bring them down chronically. Okay, and so chronically meaning maybe in that moment, they are elevated. And then maybe they're coming down 24 hours later and 48 hours.\n\nHowever, if you were to compare your resting level, say that Monday, before you worked out to your resting level, that Monday, the week following, the week following that, what you would probably see is your baseline inflammation goes down. And so we got to be really careful. We're talking immediately post-exercise. Man, these markers look terrible. Maybe my recovery score is awful. It's such that's not necessarily a bad thing because what we're looking to do is to not only change what's happening today, but we're trying to cause adaptation that may take us weeks or months to actually access.\n\nI love that you're highlighting this principle because one of the more obvious ones to me now that you've said this is heart rate. Absolutely. My heart rate goes very, very high during exercise and I do that fairly consistently, or even semi-consistently, my resting heart rate will actually be quite a bit lower.\n\nThat's a fantastic example. Really what you're getting at here is this concept where I think it's important to differentiate between adaptation and optimization. Now, we hear that word, and I use it, and most scientists hate it, but it's a good communication to an optimization. If you're optimizing for the current moment, you're almost surely compromising the late adaptation. Right? If I were to say, do the thing right now that makes you feel the absolute best in the world. And you're like, great, you took a nap and you had a donut, like awesome, you feel amazing. But you know, it's causing long-term issues. The same can be said in the back end. If you're never choosing things that make you better right now, you're never actually going to see any adaptation. So what we're really doing with this\n\nrecovery conversation is playing this game of balancing immediate gratification with the lake gratification. And how do we identify how much to do now versus not? How do I use a value or a marker, whether this is how tired I feel today, how sore I am today, or this is a score on an app or a tracking metric, whether this is a blood marker or anything. And understand, if that's what I need to cause the adaptation, I want a week, a month, three months from now. And in the case of some of our other athletes, it's even up to four years, right? We're trying to cause adaptations that will get us where we want to get in the Olympics\n\nor World Championships or World Cup or? We're trying to cause adaptations that will get us where we want to get in the Olympics or World Championships or World Cup or wherever we're going to be. So that's the framework we have to think about recovery. We maybe falsely think about it as I need to maximize my recovery today. And you could do something like taking anti-inflammatory, whether this is a supplementation or a drug or maybe this is ice. Oh, cool. That's great. That will enhance your recovery in this moment. That'll make you feel better today, probably tomorrow.\n\nBut what we know is that blocks the signal for adaptation. So you're not going to get the same results, you know, four, six, eight weeks from now. So when we talk about recovery, we have to understand what tool am I using and why? And in order to do that, we have to understand what am I training for and what am I trying to maximize? If I am in the middle of a season with an athlete and we are competing tomorrow, I am going to hedge towards acute recovery, right? Because I have to actuate that performance right now.\n\nIf I am starting the off season, I'm not hedging towards recovery. I'm actually hedging towards adaptation. So we're not going to deploy any of these, especially things like there's evidence that a combination of vitamin C and vitamin E will blunt hypertrophic adaptations because they're anti-inflammatory, they're the antioxidants, right? Other studies have shown maybe they don't have inhibitory effect, but they may or may not. The point is, conceptually, you want to be careful of what you're trying to optimize for.\n\nAnd you have to have that for thought, and that alone is going to dictate your decision-making with whether or not, again, you get in the eyes, you do that. Now we will cover some tools, like massage massage that are pretty fine to use. You don't have to worry about those blocking long-term adaptation, but others, you're going to want to be very careful about. So this principle that you've laid out for us, which is that there's a set of events that occur during exercise, that trigger the adaptation.\n\nAnd that sets in motion a number of adaptations that occur during recovery that then give us the exact opposite response to what the trigger was. So I'll go back to the heart rate example. Heart rate is close to maximal or maximal. You do that enough times within a week or so or two weeks and your resting heart rate goes down. As I recall a few episodes ago, you said that your maximum heart rate\n\ndoesn't really change that much. Is that correct? Yes. But your resting heart rate can go down quite a bit. Yep. Is that a general theme, meaning do we have a more or less set upper limit or ceiling for things like inflammatory markers for heart rate,\n\nmaybe even things like stress. And what we do when we deliberately trigger stress or a dramatic increase in heart rate or dramatic increase in inflammatory markers is that we are lowering the floor, but that the ceiling remains the same. It's very dependent upon the marker. So in the case of maximum heart rate, it will not change with the exception of one thing, which is age. Age brings it down. Training will not change it up in most circumstances.\n\nIf you look at something like an inflammatory response, I suppose theoretically there is a ceiling, though I'm not aware of it. I can tell you right now looking at blood markers at things like creatine kinase. So remember the conversation about metabolism and we use phosphocreatine as one of our primary fuel sources for explosive exercise. Well, if we're using phosphocreatine, this creatine kinase, remember kinase are enzymes that function to break things down for the most part.\n\nSo creatine kinase is the enzyme you use to break down creatine. When you do that a lot, then that creatine kinase gets out of muscle and seeps into the blood. Myoglobin is actually another fantastic marker, by the way. Myoglobin is, if you think about hemoglobin being in blood, is the molecule that carries oxygen around. When it's in the muscle tissue, then it's myoglobin,\n\nmyel-meaning muscle, and it's the same globulant thing. So there's in the muscle tissue, then it's myoglobin, myel-meaning muscle, and it's the same globulent thing. So there's a bunch of markers you can look at, muscle breakdown, and one of the things that you can see is a creatine kinase level that's elevated after, say, one bout of exercise, and it might be up, you know, five or sixfold. I've actually seen this number in offensive linemen\n\nin the NFL, be something like 500 plus fold. So even within just one category to the next, that number can get extraordinarily high. And if you note, this is actually one important point here. If you're paying attention to any mechanistic research or you're using that to inform your decision making, you have to be extraordinarily careful of magnitude.\n\nAnd what I mean by that is if I were to be running a Western blot looking at a signaling protein in a muscle, did this activation of this protein turn on myocondrial bilegenesis. And I saw that whatever intervention we gave it, whether it was an attrition thing or a drug or an exercise. And I saw that that signaling protein increased by 20%. I would basically assume that to be totally physiologically irrelevant. Because in order for that to be important, it totally depends on the marker you're looking at.\n\nBut some markers, I might need to see four or five, six hundred fold increase before I know that that will actually be enough to be what we call physiologically relevant. Others, if they're up one or two percent, that is relevant. And so you really want to be careful when you're either reading papers or looking at social media stuff, if people are just talking about this marker increase this much, it may not matter. It may be totally irrelevant physiologically. And so you have to, that does also what you're wondering, like, how the hell are the\n\nall these people? Well, that's how they can trick you a little bit. I mean, what intentionally or not, could be just, they're trying to do their best, but they don't really understand that area enough. And so that's an important point to pay attention to. So to answer your question again, fully, it would be hard to determine if there is truly\n\na maximum level. Some things don't want to move like blood pH. It doesn't really want to move. The range that you're going to move from is 6.8 to 7.4. And if you get up to like 7.9, like you're probably in big, big, big trouble. Other things again can go up 500, 5000 fold. And so the markers will really determine that answer.\n\nWell, at some point in the future, I'd love to continue this discussion around the topic of stress specifically. And maybe we will get into that a little bit later today when we get into the use of deliberate cold exposure because that certainly has effects related directly to temperature on tissue, but it certainly has mental effects\n\nin terms of raising one's level of perceived pain. It's fun. It's okay. Yeah, some people love it, and some people love it for the feeling they get during it. Deliberate cold exposure, some people only like it for the feeling that they get after it. Not unlike exercise. Totally. I love to train, I love exercise, but I know many people they love exercise, but they love the feeling afterward. So this will be a theme that we will come back to. Thank you for indulging my interest in that semi tangent. I think it's a relevant tangent. If there is such a thing, you can now\n\nreturn us to the different timescales and modes of recovery, because I think where we are headed is how to get better at recovery. Yep, let's talk about the tools, let's talk about what to measure and identify for all four of these distinct levels. So level one is what we call overload. And just very quickly, what that means is I did a workout today.\n\nThe sign and symptom of overload is your fatigue, a cute performance is down. So, I worked out hard right now. If I were to go try to do a maximum effort, I would be reduced in my ability. The recovery period for acute overload is minutes to days. That's generally what we call acute overload. And that's what we're looking for. So, we, systems should theoretically see that Hormetic stressor come back in response, come back bigger,\n\nbetter, more efficient, et cetera. If you were to continue training in that state, like most of us do, and say I did a workout today, I had a little bit of a cute overload, going to work out again tomorrow, a little more cute overload, going to work out the next day, a little more acute overload, even if you took a day in between, it's, that doesn't matter, right? You just continue these acute bouts of insult. Then you're gonna be pushing into\n\nthe absolute golden target, which is what we call functional overreaching. So you have overreached what you can currently do, and it results in a functional outcome. And what we mean functionally here is performance is enhanced. And again, performance being whatever you deem it to be. You're stronger, you've enhanced muscle size, your mitochondria has improved, whatever the thing is,\n\nit's not just a physical performance thing, right? Amazing. Recovery time for functional overreaching is typically a few days to maybe even a week or so. And so typically what we see happen is prior to a competition individuals will do what we call a taper, which is a reduced training volume for some short period of time.\n\nAnd the reason they do that is to, again, actualize is the phrase we hear is here, the adaptations. And so you worked hard for six weeks, and theoretically the workout you did three, four, five, six weeks ago, once you allow the system to recover, we'll be actualized, which means your performance will be enhanced here. Functional overreaching is the golden target. If you were to be at the point of functional overreaching and you continue to train, so\n\nit intensified, whether this is through intensity, this is through volume, or really as you said earlier, you had something holding back your recovery. It doesn't really matter, right? It's sort of two sides at the same point. Then you would move into what we call non-functional overreaching. So you've overreached again, but now it is non-functional as you did not see a positive benefit once recovery allowed. This typically means you have weeks. It takes weeks to come back from and you basically just get back to baseline. And this is where a lot of folks are who end up in this vicious cycle.\n\nAnd so you're like, man, I'm not getting the results I want. I'm going to train harder. I'm not getting results I want. I'm going to train harder and harder. But because recovery isn't improved, you just end up in the same spot so that you train more. And you end up the same spot. And you end up then just either blowing up or quitting and you're not getting where you want. If you were to continue past that point, you may actually be into what we actually call overtraining. And that typically is considered to be overtrained if it takes months\n\nAnd that typically is considered to be over trained if it takes months to recover from. So most people think they're over trained are really not. You're just probably non-functionally over-reached. And again, the classic distinction is if you took three or four days off and you felt better, you weren't probably quote unquote over-trained.\n\nYou were probably just in this area of non-functional reaching, you needed a little bit of a back off. If you, and this has been the case, I've had this happen with gymnasts and a cheerleader and some other things where they take a month off and we're barely seeing them start to come back to their baseline numbers. In any number of areas, mood, desire to train, testosterone, cortisol ratios, bowel markers in a number of areas, physical performance, vertical jump height, like all these things, they just start to get back\n\nto baseline. So over-true over-training is actually quite rare. Non-functional over-reaching is much more common and it is a shorter time frame scale. So when we talk about recovery, those are the four pieces that we're really thinking about. So if you are concerned about, oh, I'm super sore. How do I get less sore? How do I either not be a sore?\n\nNext time I do that same workout or I'm super sore in how do I recover? Those are playing in that first category of overload. And we can certainly talk about how to figure that out, but the quick answer is, you gotta go back to our previous episodes and just pay attention to the volume intensity recommendations. If you're getting significantly more damage or fatigue in a workout, you probably have increased your volume too quickly,\n\nor something else is dragging your stress bucket down. But generally, this is a problem of training. You either didn't warm up sufficiently, your fueling strategy is off, which we'll talk about in the next episode, or you've violated one of our principles of increasing intensity and volume, sort of too quickly. If it's past that and you're getting to a stage where you're just like, I'm feeling beat up all the time, my energy is going down, I'm just not feeling like I'm recovered. Now we're in this overreaching stage. So the story I kind of tell here always is a few years ago I was working and my wife Natasha was in the garage training and I'm doing something and like she comes stumbling and she has this look on her eyes and they're like giant, her eyeballs are giant.\n\nShe's like wobbling and she's like, I eyeballs are giant, she's just like wobbling. And she's like, I have to up. And I was like, what do you mean you like have to up? And she's just like, I read the program wrong. And she's like, Trump, what'd you do? Well, like, she was supposed to be doing 10 sets of three, every minute on the minute. And she did three sets of 10, every minute on the minute.\n\nAnd she was absolutely wrecked. She couldn't move for a few hours afterwards and then for days she's just like, you have to handle the kids like I can't get out of bed, I can't move. So that was like a classic example of, all right, like we don't need to fix recovery here. You're just a dummy and you did the training way too hard\n\ntoo long, like this is not, we don't have a problem here. So if it's a situation like that is generally you just, the program was way off. If it's constantly happening, what you're just like, man, like for whatever reason every once in a while, I'm getting really sore or having a really bad performance in these workouts, then we need to go to our other stress bucket, take a look at our allostatic load or allostasis and get figured out what's happening there. So those are the easy ways to flag acute overload problems.\n\nI'd like to see a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens.

I'm happy that you pointed out the distinction\n\nbetween functional overreaching, overraining, and being overtrained. And one common mistake that people make in thinking about biology generally is that they think in terms of nouns and adjectives and not verbs. Amazing. I love that so much. You know, biology is a collection of processes or processes, depending on who you are and where you live and who you trained with. Being over-trained is a state that in many ways is an adjective. You're over-trained. I'm over-trained.\n\nIt's like saying, you know, I'm an American, I'm a, you know, checklist of hockey and whatever it happens to be, right? And in many ways, people do start to associate with an identity, at least a transient identity. And they start making all sorts of decisions, it sounds like, about what sorts of verbs they will and will not engage in. Whereas I think if we look at things as processes and we assign verbs to them, then we can say,\n\nokay, I'm functionally overreaching, or I'm truly over-training, which is just a matter of degrees, or under-training for that matter. I'm not, I'm reaching, but I'm not functionally reaching. It's just performance. And you know, just as with the nervous system won't change unless you give it a reason to. This is the reason why if you can perform something perfectly\n\nor speak a language perfectly, there's no rewiring of the nervous system. This myth that we've all been told that every experience rewires your nervous system, it's different now than it was two seconds ago. That's a ridiculous illogical statement. We know that's not true. If your nervous system can perform something, it has no reason to change and it won't. Muscles the same way. This is why you have to progressively overload. You have to learn something new or challenge your muscle to do something new. It's the same way. This is why you have to progressively overload. You have to learn something new or challenge your muscle to do something new. It's the same thing. So in the example that you gave with your\n\nwife doing this workout that turned out to be far more strenuous, she had functionally overreach. In some sense, she might have been overtraining or heading in the direction of overtraining, but the mistake would be to assume that she was overtrained, right? As it kind of, it's almost becomes a bit of a state or a character assignment, as opposed to a verb. And in any case, there's no perfect way to describe it. So we're talking about nouns and adjectives, and we're also talking about verbs. But I think the verbs are really anchored down in processes\n\nand things that we do actions that we can take. And so if I may, I'd like to just highlight this idea of shifting one's thinking towards verb actions rather than labels on the state that we happen to be in or the person that we happen to be, right? Sometimes it even does become kind of character logical in the way that people describe it. And so I have to believe that there is something\n\ncalled over-training, that over-training is real in other words, but that we don't ever really know if we're over-trained. You nailed it. There's no, it's not like a red flag shoots up out of your shoulder and it's like, I'm over-trained. So in doing so, I hope that we can start thinking about some of the verbs, the actions that we can all take in order to ensure that we stimulate progressive overload one way or another.\n\nAnd at the same time that we don't fall into these bins of character assignment, we're suddenly we decide that we need to do acts like take a month off or something like that. Because I'm beginning to realize from our discussion that that's exactly the wrong way to go. Those are fantastic points. I wanna make sure it is clear that there is no clinical diagnoses for overtrain, there are no standards, there's no test or blood panel you can pull that would actually identify you in that state. So your distinction here, Andrew, of these are verbs\n\nand rather than nouns is so wonderful, because that is exactly the case. The only way we could really come retroactively diagnose one with overtraining is if, again, we had, you did weeks of recovery and you only got back to baseline. So we can't do it in the moment. I can't take a single test. There's no subjective marker or it as you are over-trained. It is simply, you are probably over-training, and we need to reverse that quickly. Or in the case of the step before, you are probably non-functionally over-reaching, and if you continue to do this, you will probably enter a new stage where this is your over-training, and we need to come back. So that's an important thing to let people know\n\nis there's no one thing we can actually point to that says you are here, you are not a noun. This is a verb. So what are some tools that we can use to enhance our recovery? Yep, let's start off with that acute overload phase. So in other words, I just did a workout and I'm feeling awful or I just did one,\n\ntwo days ago, I'm super sore. How do I get rid of that right now? Well, there's a couple of things you can do immediately after your workout and then others that are maybe more actionable a day later or two days later and we'll discover, handful them, we'll do some nutrition and hydration and supplementation in the next episode. I'm gonna cover everything else,\n\nnot in that category right now. So a couple of things, number one, you can actually start, not in that category right now. So a couple of things. Number one, you can actually start kickstart that recovery process at the end of your current training session. And I guess I should say this way, I strongly suggest you start this recovery process immediately after the workout. You mentioned earlier about this idea of you got to get a really high peak of stress to cause adaptation But I actually didn't explain that correctly because what has to happen is you need that extremely high peak But you then you have to be met with an extremely sharp recovery back down and so you know\n\nYou've talked about this before in some of your Neural plasticity stuff and in terms of what has to happen, that cause the insult, and then you immediately need to be able to recover to make sure that that causes changes in the range. Same thing happens here. So we need a really sharp and high inflammatory response, and then if you do not meet it with an immediate recovery period,\n\nthe signal won't be there to maximize your results. So what's that mean? You can actually do a couple of things. Number one is actually listening to slow-paced music. signal won't be there to maximize your results. So what's that mean? You can actually do a couple of things. Number one is actually listening to slow-paced music. There is evidence to suggest fast-paced music may slow down your recovery, and slow pace would actually enhance it.\n\nSo if you just change from your maximum, get you up and get going, music, during the workout to a slower cadence, that will help you kickstart the idea. Of a similar note, you can also use what we call down regulation breathing. You could do them in conjunction or one or the other, whichever is up to you.\n\nSo my personal favorite method here is somewhere between three to 10 minutes of finishing your training session. Laying down, I'd like to be in that position, you could certainly do it in the lotus position, but I think laying in your back is generally more effective. Personal preference there, no science. I like the eye is being covered, getting into this dark, quiet sort of area. And then just breathing through your nose in a structured cadence. There's a lot of different things you can try. An easy example is just box breathing. So you can imagine box having four squares. So what you're going to do is inhale for somewhere between like three to eight seconds.\n\nAnd then whatever number you choose, you keep that same tempo. And so let's say you chose to do a five second inhale. That's going to take you up vertically. And then horizontally for your box is a five second hold. And a five second exhale and then a five second hold. And you just need to repeat that for the time domain. I typically honestly don't use a timer. You'll actually notice a lot of people will like fall asleep or get really close to falling asleep in this period. You could do a triangle version of that where you do an inhale, hold exhale and then go right back into your inhale or there's a bunch of different tricks you can try here.\n\nYou need to play around and see what actually works best for you. Ten minutes is probably better, but if you can just at least give me three, that'll work. If you're really, really resistant, you can actually do that just in the shower. And so if you're going to finish your work out, get in the shower, again, just close your eyes in the shower, give me three minutes of focused relaxation breathing, and that will accelerate the recovery process. I love it, and I particularly love it because my laboratory works on stress and respiration at K breathing and the interactions between the two. And I'll just mention a result that was just accepted for publication, so it should be\n\nout by time this happens. Hey, great. Thank you. This is the beautiful work of Not Me Directly, although it took place in my lab, but as we know, it's the students of postdocs who really do the heavy lifting of Dr. Malice Balbon in my lab, the phenomenal researcher,\n\nthat showed that a short period of five minutes of box breathing of exactly the type that you described were cyclic sighing. So two inhales followed by an extended exhale to lungs empty. Ideally, the inhales are done through the nose. The exhales are done through the mouth, although it could all be done through the nose or the mouth for that matter, but probably nose, nose for inhale, inhale, mouth for exhale, or inhales through the nose and exhale through the nose. Sick like sighing as we refer to it done for five minutes. Both of those produce very\n\nsignificant decreases in resting heart rate. The overtime will increase things like heart rate variability and so on and so forth. So provided that there are extended exhales, it seems like the calming response and the reduction in overall stress occurs. The only thing that really sends things in the other direction would be something like cyclic hyperventilation. I'm sure you've observed that. And interestingly, when we had people just do five minutes of meditation, during which of course they are breathing, but they, of course, they are breathing.\n\nBut they're just allowing their breathing to progress. However, it happens to be in that moment or moments across the five minutes. There were reductions in the same sorts of markers of stress that I described, but not as significant as breathing. So I love the Brock's breathing tool post workout. And there's some other alternatives there too, I just mentioned. But I think people greatly underestimate the potency of breathing for shifting one's nervous system function away from stress or if one wants toward more alertness and stress. I actually have a\n\ncouple questions for you on that. Sure. I think the audience would appreciate this. How long were those boxes? Does it just use your selected? Great question. So we use the carbon dioxide tolerance test in order for people to determine how long the different sides of the box should be. And you cover carbon dioxide tolerance test in a previous episode.\n\nWe can provide a link to that clip in the show note captions. But as you point out, it involves a long extended exhale to lungs empty. And of course, people could sit with lungs empty, but they have to accurately refake fully, as we say, report how long it took them to empty their lungs. We use that as a gauge. Typically, if it takes, if people go to lungs empty in 20 seconds or less, I believe I have to go back to the paper and look, but I believe that the duration for each of the sides of the boxes is it were, was somewhere between two and three\n\nseconds. If they had a CO2 discard time of anywhere from 20 seconds up to about 40, 45 seconds, we use it the sides of the box where I believe between four and six seconds. And then for people longer than who could discard their error over a period of a minute or more, we used a box duration that is inhale hold, exhale hold duration of somewhere between, I believe it was seven or maybe it was eight and as long as 11 or 12 seconds. Yeah, those are kind of free diver types who can really do this, who are really well trained for this sort of thing. The don't quote me exactly on those numbers,\n\nbut that was approximate. Those line up exactly with what we've done. So I believe it's gonna be close within seconds of non-important distinction. It's gonna be close enough. So that's great. And that was, it took them what, six weeks? If we could have done this. So this study was done over the period of a month and then when they were swapped into a new\n\npattern of breathing condition or meditation condition. And this was all done in the natural world as we say. They were wearing boot bands that were getting heart rate, heart rate variability, sleep data, subjective data about mood, etc. So there were a lot of measures, but this was more than 100 subjects out in the wild of life. And we tried as best we could to track life stress events and exercise and things like that. That was harder to control outside the laboratory. Really all those results speak to exactly what you're describing here, which is that deliberate respiration that involves controlled holds and exhales really has a dramatic and very immediate impact on reducing our levels of stress. That's wonderful.\n\nI'm not surprised at all with your findings. And what's really interesting about that is you mentioned how the exhalation portion is primarily responsible for the down regulation. And that actually goes back to our previous endurance conversation, which is that in general at rest, at non-altitude, increases in CO2 are the primary driver for ventilation. And so what that generally means is, inhales are associated with an uptick and sympathetic state, and exhales are associated with a uptick of parasympathetic state.\n\nThis is generally why folks will do things like exhale and finish that exhale right before they perform a very high precision neurological task. So if you're going to say aim at a target and shoot, you're going to exhale fully and then almost always execute that movement at the end of the exhale because that's when you're in your highest parasympathetic state and lowest drive for ventilation. I have to say I'm not surprised at all that you guys found that. There's actually other data that point to individuals, particularly after endurance training that can get back down to baseline heart rate is going to be correlated with who gets the\n\nmost actual result to their training. Said that if you take a bunch of individuals and put them through an endurance training program, and if you measure how quickly they can get back down to baseline after each workout, in general, those folks that are better at that are going to see greater improvements in performance at the end of your, say, four, six, or eight week training block. And so there's a little bit of causation and correlation there that we have to untie, but I think it's enough to say, hey, if you invest these three, in your case, your, your, say, five minutes, it's only going to enhance recovery. You have a likelihood\n\nof increasing the results from your training. And now we also have additional benefits like being able to transition more properly into our next task, going to work, going to see family, whatever the thing is. And it's a nice close to, I asked you to be in a high sympathetic state body,\n\nand I asked you to perform and to be under stress. I gave you recovery and now we're ready to transition into our next thing so that we don't take that exercise energy, if you will, into our next task, which may or may not want me in a sympathetic drive state. So if somebody is sore following a workout, either locally sore in a muscle group or group of muscles, maybe in the legs or chest or torso. Maybe their whole body is sore, as it sometimes is the case. What are some tools that they can implement in order to accelerate the, I want to call it moving out of that soreness,\n\nbut it's really, as we know, the alleviation of the soreness through a bunch of different processes. What are the most effective tools to push back on the soreness through a bunch of different processes. What are the most effective tools to push back on that soreness and dissipate it? Yeah, absolutely. First of all, it's not lactate. That's just a really important thing that we still hear people talk about is,\n\nyou know, your sore 24 hours later, you gotta do this thing to get the lactate out of there. As we talked about in the metabolism conversation in episode, that is not the cause fatigue and it's certainly not the cause of soreness. So not an actionable tip there, but just a pet peep of mine when I hear people say that I get irritated. So we can maybe end that conversation. Strategies, tools. Here's what you can do. You can actually wear compression gear. That will help a little bit. There is a decent amount of evidence suggesting\n\nif you just were to put some tighter fitting clothes on, leisurewear or compression gear if you have it, that can actually prevent a little bit of soreness from occurring. If you're in the case of Port Natasha and you realize you've just done way, way, way too much or you went and hung out with your bow hunting friend and you trained way too hard and you realize,\n\noh my goodness, I'm going to be very sore here. You can immediately put on compression gear and wear that really for as long as possible. What are some examples of compression gear? I've seen people on the plane with those high, high socks. Yeah. I mean, anything that you wear compression gear for what you do for exercise. So whether these are just compression pants and leggings, the tight fitting leggings, whether this is a long sleeve shirt, that's like a rash guard, you would wear in, you know, Jiu-Jitsu or surfing or something like that. As long as it's tight fitting,\n\nit doesn't have to be much more than that. You can wear, as suppose you could get the socks, it would be great, but we generally just tell our athletes they would put on, you know, long sleeve compression shirts that they would wear for their training and then long compression leggings. And that'd be fine. Can people apply these compression garb after training and still get some of the positive effects? Yeah, I have not seen any evidence to suggest that that would block adaptation. That may be the case.\n\nI am not aware of those studies if that happens, but I certainly know that the information suggests it can enhance a little bit of muscle recovery. But ideally one knows if they are about to do a workout that could trigger a lot of soreness. Yep. And then where's compression gear of some sort to offset that? And if so, does it have to be local to the muscle groups that you're working on? The reason I asked about the socks is my understanding the socks, the compression socks people were on the plane is that it's going to shift the patterns of blood flow, not just in the lower legs, but all over the body. Yeah, you're probably going to want to focus it on the actual exercising tissue,\n\nthough actually that's a really good question. I don't know the answer of whether or not you didn't upper body workout, only wore lower body compression gear if that would actually help. That's a great question. It may have been done, I don't know, but I don't know the answer to that. In general, we just tell people like where, or the whole thing as much as you can. I actually am not concerned that you're wearing it during your workout. It is something you could put on afterwards\n\nor even wear it as a little bit of compression the other day. We've actually did a really fun study. I collaborated with Bill Kramer, who's, you know, sports scientists of the year award is the Bill Kramer award. That gives you an indication out of University of Connecticut as well as with Lee Brown. So two lifetime achievement award winners. And really, we put people on a plane in stores, Connecticut, and flew them to Cal State, Fullerton, so a cross-country flight. And some of them got to wear a compression gear during the flight,\n\nand others did not. And then they landed in California, did a training bout, put them back on the plane, went back to stores, and I think they did another training bout when they got back there. There was a lot of data that came out of that paper, but one of the things that was clear is the compression group was effective at handling some of the things that was clear is the compression group was effective at handling some of the blood-related coagulation and other issues associated with long flights, and\n\nparticularly athletic performance. So, that's actually a sneaky little insider trick that I'll use a lot with people, particularly with athletes that are traveling, is just where that compression gear on the plane. So you talked about that and that sort of pronged that study to mind that it's another effective strategy. So compression gear in general as well as particularly on a plane, basically the tighter you can get it the better without obviously making your hands purple and being uncomfortable and things like that. So it doesn't have to be overly tight, anything will work and probably help. So I'm also doing that personally anytime I'm taking a flight like that as much as I can.\n\nThat's just to feel a little bit better when I get there. So what are some other methods that we can use to alleviate acute soreness? Well, if we continue down the same theme, which is saying, okay, we use some sort of pressure manipulation to enhance recovery. If compression is one strategy, you can also use things like compression boots or garments and these are nomadic devices that will pump air outside you and compress back and forth. There's any number of devices that will do this. You can also use the physical hand, so this would be massage and body work.\n\nThey're all really working as best we can tell on the same mechanisms, which are effectively moving fluid in and out of the tissue, as well as potentially enhancing blood flow, increasing capitalization, which is going to only get nutrients in and waste products out. So you can kind of pick and choose based upon your budget, preferences, availability timing, things like that. So those are all effective strategies. Outside of that really is the next largest category, which is now thermal.\n\nAnd so far in this discussion, we've mentioned cold water immersion. And I talked about in the hyper-tree section how you would not want to do that, immediately post-exercise, which would be getting into cold water or an ice bath, if you're trying to grow muscle mass. Having said that, there is good evidence showing that cold water immersion specifically is\n\neffective at reducing muscle soreness. So it is a fair consideration, and it's a classic example of how there are no free passes in physiology. Nothing is always good or always bad. It's always about what are you willing to give up and versus what you're willing to get. And the case of like Cold Water Immersion, you may be thinking, yeah,\n\nI might want some of the hypertrophic adaptations, but if you're in that phase of training where you're actually trying to push more towards optimization in that moment, rather than long-term adaptation, then an ice bath might be a great choice. In addition, if you fall into a scenario like Natasha did, and you realize I'm just so unbelievably sore, this might cost me three or four or five or six days of training.\n\nIt might be worth it for you to accelerate that recovery process by a couple of days so that you don't miss so much training. It's just an algorithm. It's an equation. What am I looking for? Again, if I'm in season or trying an equation. What am I looking for? Again, if I'm in season or trying to compete or if I have just done way, way, way too much exercise and I'm really insignificant pain, you would probably be willing to give up some small percentage of eventual muscle growth after a single session to get out of pain. So of the cold\n\nstrategies, cold water immersion is clearly the best approach, rather than cold air or some other tactics. So a cold shower is probably not enough here. You really do want to be either in moderately cold. This is maybe 40 to 50 degree water for probably north of 15 minutes, or you can be in sub 40 for as little as maybe five minutes to get some of the effect. And there's been a number of studies, some sort of summarizing a bunch of that kind of into one rather than going through them, point by point. The numbers you just throughout,\n\nI'm assuming are Fahrenheit seem really cold to me. Uncomfortablely cold. Absolutely. So I always recommend that people ease into it as a protocol overall, that they not immediately go to 35 degree cold water if they've never done it before. That said, once people are comfortable being uncomfortable, because I always answered the\n\nquestion, how cold should it be exactly? Would you agree that it should be very, very cold so much so that you really, really want to get out, but that you are able to stay in safely. Whatever that value happens to be. You absolutely need to be safe. Having said that, we have actually in our XBT retreats put dozens, if not hundreds of people at this point, immediately into the sub 35 degree water their first time ever and done, you know, three minutes, multiple rounds and a session.\n\nSo they can handle it, but you don't need to go that crazy if you don't want, you kind of have to play a game, right? Do you want to be really, really cold for a short amount of time or do you want to be like kind of cold for a longer amount of time? I really, the only mistake you could make is doing something like 65 degree water,\n\nwhich for the most people is not very comfortable and doing five or 10 minutes. It's just not gonna be effective. It's probably not gonna be effective. So if you're like, man, 35 is absolutely crazy and you wanna do 55 degree water and there's literature in that area, but it's going to say you need to probably be there, you know, somewhere almost surely north of 10 minutes\n\nand some of it will actually show you need to be in there like well north of 20 to 30 minutes. So for my money, I would rather go really, really cold and get it done in five minutes, but personal preference on this one. You can also make it a little bit easier on yourself. There is not nearly as much evidence, but there is some on contrast stuff. So this is when you go cold, hot, sort of back and forth. There are no really good rules in terms of how much should you go,\n\nhow many rounds, how long and cold, how long and hot. Again, there have been a couple of studies, but obviously those studies use numbers, but that doesn't mean those have been tested to see what are optimal, which is a very big difference. So you can really just kind of play that by feel. Hot is good for recovery. You just have to be careful because you are going to put more blood flow in the area. And so you may walk out of there with some additional cues swelling, which is then going to put greater pressure on there. So you have to kind of play with it. I personally really like hot for recovery. I will feel maybe not great in that moment, but the next day I tend to feel really, really good. In addition,\n\nif I wake up the next morning, and I'm really, really hurting and I'm super stiff, a hot bath will help that quite a bit. So you can play with some of those protocols. Again, you don't have to do ice. There's absolutely no requirement to do so. It is just an option if you're interested. Yeah, the studies of Dr. Sizema Soberg. Sure, yeah. Are not directly aimed at alleviating soreness or recovery. They're more about increasing thermocompacity\n\nby a storage of brown adipose tissue, not the bluvery fat, but the stuff around the clavicles and around the heart that help you generate body heat at rest and metabolism and so on. And the numbers there that she's come up with, again, have not been tested against all the possible derivations, just like with breathing, we did five minute sessions, but who knows, maybe a minute would have been equally effective. We just, there are constraints on these sorts of studies, but the values that she's come up with, which seem to be good thresholds for making sure\n\nthat an adaptation response is triggered by heat and cold, is it ends up being 57 minutes per week total of uncomfortable but safe heat in that case sauna, and that can be all in one session or breaking it up into a couple of sessions on the same day or different days, and then 11 minutes per week of cold either in one single session or multiple sessions. Again, one could do more. One could break that up over multiple days or do it all in one day or do it all in one an hour in the sauna and then 11 minutes in the cold or rice first. Although that seems a little bit extreme, especially for the uninitiated.\n\nThose are the numbers that have been studied. But as you point out, there are not a lot of really thorough studies examining different cold protocols according to temperature by time requirements. So there is a bit of subjective feel required to establish a routine. And I would actually say this is another time to reemphasize something we talked about at the beginning of our conversation, which is that pain itself is not a defined outcome. It's heavily influenced by your perception.\n\nAnd so if you don't feel like they work for you, they won't work. If you feel like they work fantastic, they do. So it's a challenging field to get really objective data on. So there's always going to be a little bit of subjective nature to some of these things. I can tell you anecdotally, we've used hot and cold contrasts for a long time.\n\nThat leads to some love it. Some don't care for it and everything in between. So it's one of those things where I never mandated. Of course I can't mandate anything for anyone to work with. But I'm never, you know, like, hey, are you interested? Great. You're struggling in this area. You want to try this.\n\nYou did and you liked it. Great. You're struggling in this area and you tried it. You didn't love it. Okay, fine. I'm not, we'll find other routes as we, we'll get into, there's a lot of ways to enhance recovery. This is only one and it hasn't even really come down to stopping the problem in the first place. We're just treating symptoms, which is first line of defense, but you really need to go\n\nback and figure out why it's happening to begin with as a solution. These are just different, again different acute symptom management tactics. One final point about deliberate cold exposure, I think worth mentioning is one of the reasons the shower is effective, but not nearly as effective as cold water immersion or immersion and ice up to the neck is simply because of the reason you stayed before, which is that most showers are not going to get that cold.\n\nYou're not going to get down into the sub-forties. Also cold showers haven't really been studied that much. They have, but not nearly as much as immersion and people always ask why. Just think about the challenges of studying cold water exposure in the shower where you can't really control for how much of the body is covered, whether or not the head stays under different sized bodies, etc. Whereas when people come into a laboratory, they can get into a cold large and we know where the neck is. We know where the chin is and we can make sure that people's arms and legs are underneath,\n\nbut with cold shower, sure you can make everyone face away or toward the shower, but it's really tricky. For all the variations that were described, that said, would you agree that if one wants to use deliberate cold exposure, that cold shower is better than nothing, and cold immersion in circulating cold water or ice bath is better than cold shower? Yeah, what I would actually say, if you're looking for recovery for muscle soreness, I would say cold shower is probably doing very little because you're not going to be able to get enough cold water onto any muscle besides basically your head. So maybe you could try a cold bath and so you at least get some surface area coverage. But yeah, if you want to use cold shower for all the other awesome reasons, the cold shower,\n\nthat's totally great. But if you're trying to use that to recover your low back and glutes from being sore from training in a good way, it's probably not going to do much of the immersion would be there. You actually also hit a sneakie, the other point which is if you can't get your water super cold, just make the water move. So if you have jets and stuff, you can turn on anyone who's tried this and you're like, okay, I can do a 40 degree bath. Awesome.\n\nTry 60 when the water is moving. Right, because you break up the thermal layer. Normally you have a little thin layer of the water that you're heating up. You break that up. It's a whole new world. Yeah, absolutely. So being very still in the cold water is actually the weaker way to go. Correct.\n\nThat you can make your face stoic, but make your body circulate. Some water around you. As long as we're on this, maybe just one more point about heat. I've certainly used sauna, wet sauna, dry sauna, steam sauna, sauna, excuse me. Chakuzis can work pretty well. Males, if you are looking to conceive in the 60 days following sauna or hot tub, do realize that both those approaches do severely limit the number of motile sperm substantially. So for people that are not trying to conceive, don't think that this works reliably enough that you could use it as a form of contraception. But for people that are trying to conceive, it really is detrimental to sperm health, right? And so for that reason, some people bring an ice pack and put it on the groin or near the groin\n\nwhen they go in. But which is hard to do in a hot tub than a sauna. So here we're getting into the fine points or crude points, if you will, pun intended. But the idea is that we wouldn't want anyone to approach these techniques and compromise their other life goals. I was not allowed anywhere near these things when we were at that stage of life. I'll just say Natasha put an X-Nay on me hanging out with Laird. So going in the sauna for those reasons, he's like, you're not going in, you're not going in. None of this stuff and I decide to wait. Right. He and sperm have a relationship, but it's not one that's positive for the sperm.\n\nI'd like to take a brief break to acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker. Inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health and well-being can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. One issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get information back about various levels of lipids and hormones and metabolic factors, etc.\n\nBut you don't know what to do with that information. Inside Tracker makes knowing what to do with all that information exceedingly easy. They have a personalized platform that lets you see what your specific numbers are, of course, but then also what sorts of behavioral, dos and don'ts, what sorts of nutritional changes, what sorts of supplementation would allow you to bring those levels into the ranges that are optimal for you.

Are there ways to combine the various types of stimuli that you described for inducing\n\nrecovery? You talked about breathing-based tools, which, while they could adjust, and indeed do adjust, oxygen and carbon dioxide ratios and et cetera, I'm guessing the major effect of those on recovery is going to be neural. It's going to be deliberate calming of the nervous system, more sympathetic based as you mentioned. Yeah, most definitely. And then you talked about some movement based and touch based approaches, which will movement certainly certainly will circulate blood, but also will generate contractions of the muscles, right, which maybe if indeed, again, it's still speculative, if indeed, some of the soreness is due to excessive stretch or swelling at the stretch ends of the muscles, that would make sense.\n\nSo movement in touch and then thermal. Are there ways to combine these that are more effective or maybe even synergistic? Yeah, I suppose you could throw on some compression garments, put on a pneumatic compression device and sit in the sauna while you down regulate your breath. That would be fine. Quite honestly though, you probably don't need to maximize all of them. We were joking. You could probably go for a light swim while regulating your breathing in cold water. You get the compression from the cold water and you'd be in a good spot.\n\nSo you can certainly do that. The reality is I generally look for some physical approach and then some holistic approach of the breathwork basically. So I want breath and then something else. If you knock those two things out, you're in a good spot. So that could be breath while you're in thermal stress. So just controlling and doing the on-regulation stuff. You have to also remember ice is a stressor.\n\nAnd I'll actually show you some data here in a second about how that actually can enhance systemic recovery, although it won't happen in the acute minutes. In fact, it's going to take at least 30 to 60 minutes, and then you'll eventually see a rebound effect. But acutely, it's going to make you actually more sympathetic, which is going to be the other direction. Heat can do the opposite, or it can actually drive you up. So it's a little bit dependent upon how you respond\n\nwhat time of day and how you're using. So in general, I guess, combining them is, if you need it, depending on what you have, what's available. So perhaps you don't have a sauna, but you can take a hot bath. Great. Maybe you have some percussion device, some tool, and you can use that, but you don't have a sauna. Amazing. I don't have ice bath these things. So I think, rather than thinking about an optimal combination of them, I would say just use a couple of the tactics based on what you have and what is easily available in your situation. I'd love for you to teach us about some of the methods for longer form recovery\n\nas it relates to overreaching and over training. Sure. You want to think about this in a couple of phases. Phase one is to try to prevent it from happening in the first place. In terms of training load, you're going to just go back to our previous episodes where we talk, give you specific instructions for how much to increase your volume and intensity per week, etc. The other thing you can do then is do some monitoring and I'll go over some different tools, some cost-free ones, as well as some higher technologically demanding ones. To monitor to see if it's actually happening. And then the third approach here is, what if this has already occurred?\n\nI figured it out, how do I get back out of that hole? So I would like to just sort of tackle these one by one in order and talk about what's happening, what tools you can use, and why they're going to work. All right, so anytime we're talking about fatigue management here, most people are aware of these terms because if you have any sort of technology, you're probably getting some sort of readiness score or recovery score or strain, depending on which app or watch or tech you have, you have a little bit of an acutely change. If you're in the sport performance world, you might be looking\n\nat things again like load or a GPS cracking and monitoring and really all of it is doing the same thing. It's trying to either one predict a problem is going to happen in the future and then placing restrictions upon you so that you don't run into that situation. The other thing is\n\npossibly doing is identifying a drop in physiology or performance and then saying, we need to get you out of this hole. That's really what's happening. And so when we think of the first one, just imagine a scenario like a mileage limitation, pitch count and baseball. And what has happened there is individuals in, you know, individuals in those fields have looked and said, hey, what we notice is people who throw say more than a hundred pitches in a game tend to start losing effectiveness and increase injury rate. Therefore, we're predicting the next\n\ntime you go to play, if you cross that threshold, we start having an increased risk of negative agon sequences. So therefore, we're going to cap your, in this case, pitching volume at that 100 pitches per game, or whatever the case. Same thing with running, et cetera, et cetera. So you could just simply do that. And there's actually really cool data coming out now on sport performance stuff, looking at things like I am using GPS trackers, and trying to identify even position by position-specific recommendations for how much distance you should cover in a practice and a training session so that you can say, hey, these positions don't cross this threshold,\n\nthese positions don't cross this threshold and basketball and tennis and all kinds of things like that. That's not probably extremely applicable to many of the listeners right now, but it is still conveying the idea that if we understand where we break, then we can stop ourselves from getting there in the first place. The functional example here is just thinking about basic things like, where do I start my\n\ntraining program, and then how do I progress it? And we've already covered those numbers. In either case, though, you want to have three markers that you're paying attention to. If you're concerned, you're getting into an overreaching phase or potentially going to lead to overtraining, or you want to get out, it's three unique things. Number one, we're going to look for some sort of performance metric, right? So this could be your times are going down, your squat numbers, your power is going down. Any of these things, so it's got to be an actual performance. Number two, some sort of physiology.\n\nAnd so I want to see something happening with resting heart rate. Some biomarker is moving. Heart rate variability, some other measure that is not influenced by you. And the beauty of using biological markers are if we contrast that to like performance, and I said, okay, here's our performance test. Every day you come in, you're going to\n\ndo a vertical jump. And if one day you come in, all of a sudden, your vertical jump is super low, I think, ooh, man, maybe we're starting to overreach. You also could be feeling lazy that day and just not a jump very high on purpose because you didn't want to work out. The beauty of biomarkers are because you didn't want to work out. The beauty of biomarkers are, you don't get to manipulate them like that. They don't care. There's a downside to it,\n\nwhich is maybe they're just indirect markers, right? And so I'm not telling you biological markers are better than performance markers. What I'm saying is you want to look at both, all right? In fact, you want to look at our third category as well, which is some sort of symptomology. And so am I having a symptom of overreaching? Am I seeing a performance decrement? And then am I seeing a biological marker as well? If you see all three of these popping up,\n\nyou have reason to believe you've reached some overreaching. Now, what you have not identified yet is if that is functional overt reaching, non-functional overt reaching or true overtraining. And remember, you shouldn't be feeling great after every training session. You're trying to cause adaptation. And until you back off maybe even weeks or months later, to actualize the adaptation\n\nand get that super compensation and performance increase, you're going to have to invest a little bit. So you're going to go in the hole. Any sport performance coach is going to look at numbers throughout the year and say, yeah, when we first start training in preparation for the season, we are going to see a drop in performance that day, that week. That's part of the plan, though, right? That's this stress you're trying to accumulate.\n\nSo you want to see all three of those markers. You just want to pay attention to a couple of things. How long are they down for? A day, three days, seven days, 15 days, et cetera. If you're seeing a performance drop in a day, and I am far away from performance. So the day that I want to peak for, I'm not going to do anything different. if I see two days in a row drop performance\n\nI'm not worried if I see more than probably in my opinion five days in a row of decrement then I might start paying attention If you're in season though or close to competition or whatever that thing means to you And you see more than a couple of days in a row of dropping, then you might actually want to take some steps to mitigate that. So it really is important you understand, again, what are we trying to do? Are we trying to cause adaptation or are we trying to cause adaptation? And I have a very specific example of all this. We can run through here in a second. And then, of course, a bunch of tools to pull you out of those phases. But that's fundamentally what we're trying to do here. I would encourage you again, don't be too reactive and responsive to any one measure. I'm going to cover a whole bunch of them in a second, but you can get lost in different\n\nthings because they all have pros and cons. So I know it's simple to just look at one score in your watch and make your decisions because of that or check your app, but you really want to be careful of doing that. You're going to probably lead yourself in the wrong direction more often than you're going to help yourself. I'm curious as to why when we overreach too much or too often or we are over training that performance is diminished. Because on the face of it, it's kind of obvious. You're overreaching, you're over-training. So performance is diminished. But that's completely circular. You hear about things like adrenal fatigue and adrenal burnout. Well, it turns out\n\nadrenal burnout doesn't even really exist. Absolutely. There is such a thing as adrenal insufficiency syndrome, but these phrases like burnout, adrenal burnout, overtraining, they're thrown around as much as words like gaslighting and obsessive compulsive, are without any real clinical definition, or there are clinical definitions, but people aren't obeying them when they use the language. I do want to acknowledge, however, what is absolutely true, which is that overreaching too much, too often, over training, these can degrade performance. But mechanistically speaking, what's going on? Because I think once we understand what's going on mechanistically, then I think we can\n\nall look at tools, whether or not it's breathing, movement, compression, thermal, psychological, motivational, etc. and have a much clearer sense as to what's going to work best and what likely won't work. I love this question so much because as I mentioned at the beginning, I was fortunate to spend my some of my graduate work in Andy Fry's lab at the University of Memphis. And we did a lot in this area and so we, in fact, this is how I learned how to do assays and run Western Blossom, measure signaling, proteins, and things like this. So this stuff is near and dear to my heart.\n\nWe also did a bunch of really wild studies. And he had done some before I got there. So I'm going to combine kind of anti-frize entire career and just highlight some of the big pictures of what he found there. He was very interested in exercise, particularly strength training and trying to figure out this entire question, right, which is like why is this actually happening when I work out too much when I lift too much that all the sudden I can't sleep. What's happening? Like why is my energy down? Why is my mood? My motivation reduced if I squat too much?\n\nSo we did a whole series of studies across this career. And again, I'll just sort of highlight some of the themes that ran through them. So the first one that jumps out to mine is really his career. He did this really awesome protocol, where he had people squat 100% of their back squat max, every day for two weeks. So you come in to Jim, and I think this first one was on a machine, and you did a one-rup max,\n\nand then you came back in every single day for two weeks. So these are what we would generally call kind of like that short to moderate range overreaching. And by definition, some of them end up actually being true over training, because it would take the individuals sometimes two to up to eight weeks to return back to their one-ratt max at the end of these protocols. So some of them were non-functional overreaching or some combination of that. Well along with that, he took a lot of blood samples as well as muscle biopsies to try to\n\nlook at what's happening. Endocrinologically, neurologically, muscle physiology-wise to pay attention to what's happened. So a couple of things that jump out there. One of his initial studies, actually, I think the very first one he did, when they ran that first squat every day, protocol. What they found was kind of colonine levels changed quite significantly. And depending on kind of what you wanted to pay attention to there, whether it was epinephrine or noripinephrine or even some other markers, they basically increased by somewhere between two to threefold. And so a little bit of understanding of sleep physiology, if adrenaline is extremely high epinephrine, you're going to have a hard time sleeping. So that alone was first indication, this is like, wait a minute.\n\nSome things actually happening here that's just beyond muscle soreness. There's some sort of systemic fatigue happening. And as you rightfully pointed out, is not the adrenal glands becoming fatigued. That's sort of a bit of tongue and cheek at pedantics. It is cortisol dysregulation and general stress syndrome, but it's really can be noted in in blood in terms of epinephrine and Norupinephrine. Another study he had done of a similar realm was over the course of seven half days People came in and did 15 training sessions. So it was really cool. These are these really short balsas of just ridiculous training and They said, okay, like something's happening with\n\nWith epinephrine and Norupinephrine, like something's happening with with epinephrine and orpinephrine, something happens, something's happening with testosterone. What's it look like inside the cell? So now muscle biopsies came on board. And they started looking at things like map kinases, which are these signaling proteins that are tend to be associated with an anabolic response, they operate muscle protein synthesis and they do many other things, but that's like a big factor of them. They looked at various antigens and glucocortocortocortoceptors, and they wanted to see that, well, maybe\n\nreceptor density or and-or sensitivity is changing. And in fact, surprise, surprise. That's exactly what they found. So they found both antigen and glucocortocortocortocontocentrations were reduced. And so you can start to see a picture forming, which is like, hmm, very similar to the insulin type two diabetes story, where you've really put yourself in a very high stress situation. So presumably, epinephrine, et cetera, testosterone releases are extremely high.\n\nIn response to that, to try to reach back to some level of homeostasis, you start down regulating the receptors for them. And so, it's like the signal can only get so high. If you're going to keep that gas on, we're going to pull back the throttle on the receptor so that the total signal stays the same, if that makes a little bit sense. Well that becomes obviously problematic. So then a final follow-up study here that is important to note is they did another protocol which was really, really cool and they said the first ones weren't enough.\n\nSo how about this? We're going to come in every day for two weeks and we're going to do 10 sets of a one rep max every day. So they were coming in and they would do 10 one rep maxes every day for two weeks. And what's really cool about that study? If they didn't complete any other repetitions, they had to repeat it until they had 10 successful one rep maxes on that given day. Absolutely brutal, brutal protocol. I wasn't there at the time. They had finished that right before I got on campus, but I was actually able to be around when they were doing some of the\n\nfinal analyses there at the tissue. What they want to look at in this particular study was beta adrenergic receptors, which are those receptors that are going to be up and effort and such are going to be binding for. So again, similar story here. Perhaps are we losing overall sensitivity because of this extreme sympathetic stimulation? Now actually thinking back what would have been pretty cool if they had had another group that did it, and did some down-regulation breathing, opposed to see if that could humiliate some of the problems. But, no, of course, this was 20 plus years ago, or something like that. So, a couple of things that happened is the 1-Rept Maxes\n\ndropped by, I think, around like eight kilos by the end of the two weeks. If I remember right, like the group average was something in the neighborhood of 151 kilos. So these were pretty well trained individuals. And it went from, oh, rather, I think actually, it was about 160 kilos and they dropped to like 152 kilos. It was something close to that.\n\nWhat was more significant though, was their power dropped by 35%. Which is really, really interesting because if you pay attention to declines in physical performance over time, and I mean, that like through aging, what you'll see is people can hold on to muscle mass pretty well.\n\nIt will go down by about, you know, 1% or so after the age of 40. However, strength will go down at like two to 4% and then power by eight to ten percent. And if you look at actually world records across strength sports by age, you'll see that they will decline by age, but not that much. However, if you look at speed sports by age, they fall off the planet. So it's very challenging to preserve fast through time, whether this is fatigue\n\nor because of age. That's really important because that'll then tell you, hey, a little bit of a canary in the coal mine, is not necessarily your strength, but your speed. And so a lot of different techniques that we use to measure performance, remember, that's our triad, right? Symptomology, physiology and performance. You're generally better looking at speed-based performance tests rather than strength-based performance tests to get an earlier indication of potential overreaching or overtraining. So anyways, back to the individual study there.\n\nIn that same group, again, we had the same problem where it took some of them two to eight weeks to come back. So what they had to do is, I can't remember the exact time frame, I probably should have thought through this, but they had to come back something like every week or every couple of days, even after the study finished, until they got back to their baseline one rep max. And some of them, I took them up to eight weeks before they finally got back. So they probably were in a classic overtraining state of that place, which was done in as little as two weeks. And this is also another point that people always ask\n\nlike how long does it take? Is this something that has to happen over the course of months or like if I were to go do two days or this intense training camp for two or three weeks, could I actually cause a training? And the answer is if it is actually truly enough volume and enough intensity, you probably can do some significant damage in as little as two weeks. Probably doesn't happen that often.\n\nMost likely you're probably going to be reaching a state of non-functional overreaching, but you may actually be able to put yourself in a position where it might take three or four weeks or more to get back to baseline after a truly intense. And again, think about this protocol. It's like totally unrealistic for the most part. 10 sets of one of a one rep max squat every day for two straight weeks. Some folks, if you're extremely highly trained, wait a little, you might do something like that when you're very close to say world championships.\n\nBut outside of that really specific scenario, it's a totally absurd training protocol. But that was the point, right? We were trying to ensure that overtraining was met or close. It's similar to when we've done, we've actually done, I think three studies in the Center for Sport Performance on Dom's muscle soreness. And in all those cases, you do just ridiculous like extension protocols, because you're just trying\n\nto ensure you cause super soreness. If you don't, then you have nothing to study. So, absurd training protocols, protocols, but that's the point. So nonetheless, as a result, sure enough, the beta adrenetic receptors were down-regulated by something like 37%. What's probably even more significant though was the sensitivity in those receptors was reduced by like two and a half fold.\n\nAnd so it's like, okay, wait a minute. We're becoming desensitized this time of the year. And we're also actually now starting to reduce our total concentration. Similar to what's actually interesting, it was a very sneaky smart thing to do is they looked at an octurnal urinary up in Eiffron and guess what? That was also up by like 50%. 15, 15, 15, 5, 0. 5, 0.\n\nYeah. And so now you're seeing this tie-in where it's like, hmm, I'm seeing a response at the tissue level. I'm seeing a response probably, although they didn't actually look at a pituitary and like that. I'm seeing adrenal and other endocological problems. And then I'm also seeing this increase in concentration of epinephrine when I'm supposed to be sleeping and surprise, surprise. I'm having a hard time sleeping symptomology. That's a very interesting finding about an nocturnal epinephrine. Epinephrine, of course, is adrenaline. It's released from the adrenals, no surprise there, but also from this\n\nbrain area called locus arulius in the brain. And the brain tends to be called epinephrine in the body adrenaline, just to complicate everyone's understanding. But that nomenclature did not come from us. So don't blame us. The point is that rapid eye movement sleet, so called REM sleet, is more abundant in the second half of the night. We know that the dreams associated with rapid eye movement sleep are more emotionally laden, and that those dreams\n\nand those emotional states are actually important for discarding the emotional load of previous day's experiences. and those emotional states are actually important for discarding the emotional load of previous day's experiences. It's sort of a natural trauma therapy, if you will, because in the normal healthy state, those dreams are associated with an inability to release epinephrine at night.\n\nSo for me, what you just described, first of all, it's the first time I've heard of it. But it ties together something really quite clear from the sleep neuroscience literature, which is that when people are stressed, they tend to get less rapid eye movement sleep. That rapid eye movement sleep normally is associated with low levels of epinephrine. So whether or not it's causal or not is it clear? but sort of doesn't matter for sake of this discussion. But what I'm wondering, and I suppose one good test for, but maybe observed, is whether or not people who are over in overtraining too much, overreaching too much, because of this elevated nocturnal epinephrine diminished REM sleep, whether or not their emotional state is also disrupted. Because one thing we know for sure is if you want to disrupt somebody's emotional state,\n\nyou deprived them of sleep and rapid eye movement sleep in particular. The one caveat to that is for those of you out there that have heard that rapid eye movement sleep deprivation, deliberate rapid eye movement sleep deprivation is a treatment for depression that is true, but it's coupled with a next night enhanced rapid eye movement sleep. So one of the major takeaways from all of this that I'm realizing is that no surprise,\n\ndaytime activities, impact nighttime endocrine function, impact quality of sleep, impact daytime activities. Yeah, actually, there's so many fun things I wanna do here now. This, actually, there's so many fun things I want to do here now. This is actually why measuring eye movement is a very fantastic tool for understanding total stress load. You can actually differentiate different types of stress. So caffeine use versus alcohol use versus sleep deprivation by actually measuring eye movements.\n\nThat's actually what we do in our absolute rest sleep company is. In addition to getting a full PSD sleep study done in your bedroom, you're gonna get an eye tracking assessment, which we're gonna be able to figure out why you're getting there. So nonetheless, yeah, if you actually look at the classic signs and symptoms of overtraining or overtraining syndrome, it's gonna be everything from performance documents like we talked about.\n\nHeart resting heart rate is going to increase. You're gonna see things like HRV drop by generally 20% or so percent, that would be a very large disruption in HRV, decrease body weight, and then all the stuff Andrew, you just talked about. So motivation, adherence, appetite, mood, all of this stuff are classically known associations with overtraining. And that's for the exact reasons you're talking about. Sleep disturbances and disruptions. Wanting to train motivation, all of this stuff goes\n\npart and parcel with non-functional overreaching and or overtraining. You can actually tie this back in a little bit more to some other biomarkers, and this is great because this is the stuff we look for. This is the physiology stuff we look for. You've probably talked about SHBG before, which is a sex hormone binding globulin. So it's this protein that will float in your body that's going to bind up sex hormones, in particular testosterone. So what happens with overtraining is you can actually take this serially, like week by week, and you can actually see this number rise. And so if you see this, like say you're using a service like inside tracker and you're getting your blood measured every so often, and you see this\n\nnumber start ticking up. This is actually associated with that because what's actually happening is it's binding up all your free testosterone. And that's just leading back to the circle we're talking about. And you can actually see the same thing happen with calorie restriction. Just not even have calories. But in this particular case, because it actually happens in both scenarios, you know what's not an issue simply of being under calorie. It's clearly an issue of the training load being too high. So just to give another little tool, there's, I can get the link for it,\n\nbut there's a website that was created by, which journal, Slipin, but I'll get it to you. You can link it up where you can actually go in and plug in a number of values from mud chemistry. So if you got your blood work done and you can plug in your pre-number and your post number. So say you got it done and then maybe 10 weeks later, you got it done again And you can plug in your pre-number and your post number. So say you got it done and then maybe 10 weeks later you got it done again. And you're wondering and you\n\nnotice, hey, my free testosterone's down or my SHBG is up. Is it actually a meaningful number? And it will actually tell you whether or not the change pre-deposed is physiologically meaningful or not or just within the error margin of the measure. And you can actually change, like right there on the website, you can change your confidence interval. So it's really, really cool. If you just have your own blood and you want to know, like, hey, I had at any level this year, and now it's here over there, it's a totally free resource created, gone through peer review, all that stuff, and I'll give you the link to that. So that's a pretty cool measure. In addition to that, like probably one of them more powerful and easy metrics biologically\n\nis to take your cortisol and DHA ratio. So this is known to be associated with a lot of things. You wanna be really careful. You don't want this number to be too high or too low. Something like 0.09 is about. And it's a cortisol to DHA. DHA to cortisol ratio, yeah. DHA to cortisol. I'd love to D H E A. D H E A to cortisol ratio. Yeah.\n\nD H E A to cortisol. I'd love to tell you I said it backwards on purpose just to make sure everyone understood, but I got it backwards. Yeah. I mean, this ratio has been associated with so many things. You have to do, you do have to be careful with association, right? Not being causation, but everything from risk of infections, the metabolic health, and other disease states, as well as more what we're talking about,\n\nwhich is, hey, am I getting sort of cortisol this regulation, which is what a lot of folks would call, again, adrenal fatigue, and that's not really what's happening. But if adrenaline and epinephrine are off in testosterone, cortisol is going to be along the right. And so you can also look at things like testosterone and cortisol ratios. So there's a lot of things you can glean here\n\nto give you some insights into where you're going. If that ratio is too high, that's going to be associated with metabolic syndrome and a bunch of other stuff. If it's too low, that's going to be associated with a lot of cognitive problems like aggression and mood and a bunch of things like that. So again, you want to keep it right around that 0.09 ratio. And most of the time actually in some blood chemistry stuff, you'll get a you\n\nget a report of that or you can calculate it pretty quickly. I'm sure we'll get into this in the episode that comes next on nutrition and supplementation. Totally. episode that comes next on nutrition and supplementation. Totally. What about compounds that lower cortisol, such as ashwagandha? I can see now, based on the logic you're spelling out, that during phases of a lot of intense overreaching\n\nor frequent overreaching, given that those compounds can indeed lower cortisol, Rodolia, Rodolia, Rosacea. Rodiola. Rodiola, Rosacea. Yeah. Fun word to say, two words, but the first one, more fun to say,\n\nRodiola, Rodacea. Rodiola, Rosacea. Rodiola, Rosacea, folks, and Ashwaganda. I've been trying Rodeola recently and mainly as a buffer to output, it does seem to have some good data attached to it related to lowering one's perceived threshold of how hard they're working. So in other words, you can work harder and not feel as if you're working really hard, which allows you to do more work. That's sort of the subjective description of how it works, but you told me that it can blunt cortisol.\n\nAnd Ashul Gonda, we know blunt cortisol, both of these things, of course, can do other things, but are these compounds that you sometimes will incorporate into a training regimen? I've been using rodeo for probably six or more years, pretty consistent, not personally, but using it with the individual you work with. You do need to be a little bit careful. I wouldn't say that it blunts cortisol. It is probably more purposefully described as cortisol modulator, which means if it gets too high or too low, it'll help keep it within normative range. There's also, it is important to note, there have been a handful of studies\n\nat two of, I know specifically, showed that Rodeol use is gonna hand strength gains. However, it may reduce muscular endurance. So, we need more human data on this stuff, and it may turn out that's not a concern to me, also turn out to be a concern. So nothing is perfect and free. There's no supplement that is a panacea. And I have used, again, in a lot of situations because the other thing you kind of have to pay attention to the cortisol is,\n\nit's supposed to be modulated throughout the day. It's not supposed to be at this normal value. In fact, if you look at normative values, it's typically described in micrograms per deciliter and depending on literally what company used to draw your blood, if you're getting it through the blood, depending on which method they used to analyze it, the normative values are like frankly, embarrassingly all over the place. They're mostly gonna be like five to 25 as a quote unquote, normative value, but that's\n\noutrageous. We also know those numbers vary massively by age, by sex, and throughout the day. And so if you only are taking a single point, this is soon you're doing a fasted blood draw, which is what most folks do, it's really only going to tell you a lot about what's happening in that moment. We need to know, well, like maybe, let's say my cortisol was, if I'm a, say, 38-year-old woman, and my 7am cortisol was, you know, 15 milligrams per desolate, that's pretty good. But if it's 15 milligrams per desolate, or at 3pm, ooh oh boy, I'm probably having some issues. So there's a change throughout the day and you need to be able to plot that curve.\n\nSo you can actually, well, pretty standard practice that we do is we look at cortisol throughout the day. We're going to take multiple markers because I don't want to just see your baseline cortisol. I want to see this curve throughout the day. That's going to tell me a ton about, again, as you're sleep being caused by this regulation, is it your training? Is it something else? So I would like take a single baseline blood marker of cortisol with a lot of grain of salt. We would typically measure at least three times throughout the day. So something like six to nine a.m. 12 to three and then something like closer to the evening.\n\nOftentimes we do much more. We'll do like seven points or something like that throughout the day depending on the situation. So you wanna be careful of that. Distance we're here. You can also get cortisol in through saliva. And now that's sort of pros and cons of that because the pro of doing it in your blood\n\nis it's much more stable. saliva is extremely responsive to whatever happened the seconds before you took that test. The upside of it though, is you can do a bunch of real-world life experiments. So for example, we will do this sometimes if we wanna see how an individual is responding to a given stressor.\n\nLet's take it, right? Let's take it and then, you know, it's spinning to a tube, we're gonna take it and then we're gonna go do this workout or this cold exposure, what we're gonna do, take it at the end. We know that it's responsive to what just happened, but that's the point.\n\nSo you can actually, there's sort of pros and cons, so you'll use the appropriate measure for the appropriate question you're trying to answer. Yeah, a couple of points and reflections about cortisol. My first laboratory duty as an undergraduate was in a, it was actually in a biosecology lab at the time they didn't have the field of neuroscience as it's now called. It was called biosecology or psychobiology. I didn't know that. No, they were used to be neurochemistry and neurobiology. They'd all collapsed into what we got now called neuroscience, which was only some years ago. But my job was to\n\ncollect cortisol samples, which means I was collecting spit, which means I was collecting saliva. And the advantage of saliva-based cortisol, it's free cortisol. It's the active form. As you mentioned, it's reflective of what happened in the seconds or minutes just prior. A couple of things about the regular cortisol pattern across the day, because I realized that while it would be wonderful for everybody to get their cortisol measured in detail multiple times in blood and saliva and so on, some people just won't do that for whatever reason or can't do that.\n\nThe basic contour of a healthy pattern of cortisol secretion is to have highest levels of cortisol in the morning is actually part of the mechanism that's associated with waking you up, viewing bright light ideally from sunlight, but other forms of bright light early in the day actually can lead to a 50%, 50% increase in that cortisol spike, which is a good thing. People who have elevated cortisol, oh no. This sets in motion, a cascade of things related to enhanced mood and alertness, immune system function, etc. What I think it can be useful for people to understand is that many things will spike\n\ncortisol throughout the day. Stress, cold water, exercise, but the idea is that it comes down to baseline or near baseline rather quickly. One of the worst situations, as you pointed out, is when the highest level of cortisol is consistently shifted to the afternoon period. In fact, that's a pretty reliable signature of certain forms of depression. This is work by my colleague David Spiegel at Stanford\n\nPsychiatry and the great Bob Sapolsky, Robert Sapolsky of Weisebres, Donkett Ulcers, and behave, et cetera, and fame. Lots of popular books there. I think that if people are trying to regulate their cortisol and they just understand that basic contour, that the baseline should be, you know, rise pretty quickly after one rises in the morning. So it's easy to remember, rise, rise, rise out of bed and rise,\n\ncore is all with light, bright light, with exercise, with caffeine, these things will all increase cortisol. And then across the day, it's normal for cortisol to spike, but then to use some of the down-regulation methods that you described in particular the breathing methods, index or size itself, as the case may be. But then to really pay attention to how much psychological and physical stress is occurring in the six hours or so\n\nor eight hours prior to sleep, does that seem like a good or broad contour of how to have a healthy pattern of cortisol release? Because you actually want the cortisol to reduce inflammation and initiate or participate in the recovery process. You will not see any progress from exercise training without a large spike in cortisol. It is critically important when we think of phrases like cortisol, inflammation, stress. This is not bad. Physiology is not personified.\n\nThere are things that don't like HU in the body. It is not good and bad. They just are. The more you try to suppress cortisol, the more you suppress adaptation. What you want is exactly what you mentioned. Large spikes met with large, quick recovery. And you want to do that throughout the day and get that Horned Medics stressor.\n\nThis is, so to going back to your Ashwaganda and rodeo issue, I think we'd be very short-sighted for people to do that as this is a prophylactic. Okay, because if you blunt cortisol, you're going to cause immunosuppressive. Especially early in the day. Totally. Taking Ashwaganda before going to train\n\nis counterproductive. Yeah, we do not just, this is not a baseline part of our foundational package, right? If you go look at the, um, athlete foundations or the athlete resilience protocols that put together, you're not going to see these things in there for that specific reason. Um, any form of cortisol regulation needs to be done strategically. If you are excessively high and we're bringing you back down to normative values at the right time, then great. If you're normal though, then taking you down lower than that is actually problematic.\n\nThe same thing is actually true since we're here for oxidative stress, foreign information, antioxidant use. We mentioned, I think earlier about taking vitamin C and vitamin E post-exercise will actually blunt out of patients or at least has a potential to do so. Same thing, right? If you're modulating this response just because, and you have not done so because of actually biological testing that indicated you needed to do such, then you actually may be making things worse. And so we see this constantly with people who take a number of supplements and substances for sleep, and then they wake up the next morning groggy, and your cortisol suppressed.\n\nOkay, great. So then they take something for stimulation, and then the rest of the day they're trying to reduce, and then they're just nasty cycle. Instead of just getting out of the way, and letting cortisol do what it's supposed to do, And then making sure again, you're teaching it. So this is actually a coachable response. You can coach your own body to go down in the later part of the day and go up in the earlier part of the day. You want to make sure that you are driving that train with intent. And so again, to reiterate, if you don't need that, you shouldn't do it.\n\nIf you don't need to lower cortisol, you shouldn't walk around doing it. You're just going to suppress the state even far. And this is what's needed. This is needed for antibiotic responses. So you're not going to grow muscle. If cortisol is not spike, it's going to compromise it rather. So you want to be intentional with these practices, especially in the form of supplementation. Be very, very intentional.\n\nI've heard it said that carbohydrates, in particular, starchy carbohydrates, can inhibit cortisol. Definitely. And this could be through the trip to fan amino acid-related pathway that ratchets up to serotonin release, probably some other things to, I mean, the idea that carbohydrates just stimulate serotonin is a little bit overly simple to get there. No, those cellular mechanisms, AMPK going up and immediately turning on there, yeah. Right. So, I think we've all experienced this. We're stressed, we're stressed. We,\n\ndoesn't necessarily even have to be highly processed, you know, uh, fat, associate, you know, fatty carbohydrates, um, you know, like potato chips and, and potato chips and dip or these kinds of things. It can also be, uh, bologna, so bolo, you know, bolo pasta, um, which here I'm not trying to demonize, um, carbohydrates. I, I do ingest carbohydrates, um, minimally or non processed carbohydrates, um, most of the time, but not all the time. And they have a fairly potent effect on lowering stress and perceived stress and even quality\n\nof sleep, which is not to say that somebody has to load up on them like crazy unless their glycogen is really depleted. Talked a lot about this in the endurance episode. I know we'll touch on it more in the nutrition supplementation episode. But in thinking about the relationship between carbohydrates and cortisol and what we've just been talking about, in terms of cortisol as being vitally important for the adaptation trigger or triggering adaptation, it's probably better way to put it, but that it can blunt cortisol, take in post-training, or maybe in the evening before sleep, what are some of the basic ways that one can think about\n\nand maybe use carbohydrates in specific ways in order to, let's say, control cortisol rather than quash cortisol. You actually have alluded to a number of times already. So we oftentimes will give people a lot of carbohydrates at night. For some of these reasons, you're going to feel fantastic. A lot of people that helps you sleep, both get to sleep and stay asleep, sleep quality. You talked about specifically, remember, think about it this way. Cortisol at its core is an energy signaling molecule.\n\nIt says we are in the need for energy. Great. Epinephrine is the same way. You'll start seeing, for example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids, put them in the bloodstream, get you prepared to do something. The problem is if it's continually elevated throughout the day with no down regulation, we start running into issues, right? And so again, this is the differentiation\n\nbetween all my cortisol slightly elevated all day versus I had a really big spike after training. I had a really big spike after a breath protocol, et cetera, and then it went back down. So that being said, if you then ingest carbohydrates, you are telling it is quick to see the signal, we have nutrients, we have energy, again, specifically carbohydrates, therefore cortisol can sort of go have nutrients, we have energy, again, specifically\n\ncarbohydrates. Therefore, cortisol can sort of go back down. We don't need to be liberating free fatty acids and preparing the need for fuel. So you can help yourself go to sleep for many, as you pointed out, many mechanisms actually of why carbohydrates will help you sleep at night. I'm for some, not all people, but some. That would be one of the relationships it has with cortisol. Great. I look forward to hearing more about how the various macronutrients and micronutrients and so-called adaptogens, this very mysterious group of compounds. In other words, adaptogen gets thrown around so much nowadays.\n\nBut as long as we're talking about adaptation, I think that'll be fair play for the discussion in the next episode about nutrition and supplementation. In my laboratory, when we study stress, we use a number of different markers, subjective reports of how stressed people feel, heart rate, morning heart rate, heart rate variability, cortisol, free cortisol, and on and on. What are some of the other markers of stress as it relates to exercise adaptations and recovery? Because once again, I think we're seeing a lot of parallels between the study of psychological stress and the study of physical stress as it relates to exercise adaptation. Remember, in terms of physiology, stress is stress. This is why we have this cool term\n\nof allostatic load or allostasis such that it really doesn't matter which System you test for it will reflect overall stress. You mentioned several of them. We've got done talking about some biomarkers HRV and heart rate are another great example because what you're trying to do is this when we were talking about about the muscle-sornest thing, what we were really getting at was a marker of how do I fix the overuse in that particular muscle. Now we've really transitioned into global markers overuse and why these are problematic or important to pay attention to, rather, is,\n\nagain, these are the indicators that you didn't just work a muscle out too hard, but you have actually done something where you've compromised all of your physiology to a level where you've influenced a circulating catacoleumine or something like it's going to influence multiple markers now like your sleep and your mood and your behavior. So that's why these things are problematic. That said, you could look at resting heart rate, not a bad thing to do.\n\nHowever, that does have multiple downsides. One thing we do know is your resting heart rate will elevate with excessive stress load. This actually doesn't matter if it is physical stress or psychological stress or a combination. So you will see that number drift up over time. Here's the downside though. It's not tremendously sensitive to smaller stressors. In other words, if you were to do something like alcohol is a very good example, you will see your resting heart rate elevate with alcohol use,\n\nexcessive tobacco use, and psychological stress. However, if you do something smaller like a hard training sessions, resting heart rate's not sensitive enough to pick that up. It will actually probably stay the same. So for those reasons, we don't actually use resting heart rate that much. We will take it, but it's not our primary indicator.\n\nThat being said, HRV is a better use. So just where the quickly for those that are unfamiliar, your heart rate, let's say for example, your resting heart rate is 60 beats per minute. That means every second it's beating. It doesn't actually happen on a consistent rhythm, such that it would beat on second one, beat on second two two beat on second three\n\netc. The rate is more variable. So I might go beat beat beat Beat there's a variation in the heart rate and at the end of that 60 seconds in this example You would have still completed 60 beats. They just aren't on the exact same pattern Well one thing that's actually quite interesting is 60 beats, they just aren't on the exact same pattern. Well, one thing that's actually quite interesting is the amount of variation in your heart rate is actually associated with your overall sympathetic or parasympathetic such that a large variation, so an arithmic pattern,\n\nis generally more representative of being more rested and recovered and being more parasympathetic. You'll notice during times of extremely high stress, you will be very rhythmic. Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep. And so this is a little bit of a confusing idea, but a high HRV is there indicated of a lot of variation, meaning you're pretty recovered. A low HRV, meaning there's not a lot of variation, means you're probably pretty stressed and\n\nwired. So it's related to our rate, but in my opinion, it is a significantly better marker of that. Now, one thing you want to pay attention to if you do this, a couple of things, there are some accuracy issues with many of the devices. Basically, everybody at this point probably has some device that's telling them their HRB. What you do not want to do is simply compare your number to somebody else. For a lot of reasons, not all of these technologies are actually even measuring the same thing. Again, some of them are actually combining\n\nwith other metrics and calling it your overall readiness or your recovery. And so now what we've actually done is made a couple of assumptions and then stack them on a whole host of other assumptions and then gave you a number. And you don't know what that sort of black box score actually even represents. So I would caution one against taking too much information from that. If you are actually measuring HRB, even within that, there's a\n\nlots of ways to calculate it that are not important here. So don't necessarily worry about the score. And then compare it to yourself and not to others. What you will see is if you use similar devices and techniques, it is hard to find data here, but in general, people that are overweight might have a little bit of a lower score, as in a worse score, we need more information on that to be clear. So in large part, the best way to use something like HRV is to measure it under the exact same circumstances every day.\n\nSo whether you're going to use just a device on your watch or your phone or your bed or anything else or you're gonna buy a special HRV on or it's fine. Just take that measure at the same time. Mostly this means first thing in the morning. So you wake up, you go the bathroom, you come back down and take your measure or something like that. You don't wait. Sometimes you took it before food and after you're, look at your phone, like all these other things that can influence stress. So take it and it usually takes somewhere between seconds to minutes to record. So you want to pay attention to that. Now, one of the things you'll notice is\n\nthere is a natural change in your HRV that just happens. And so what you kind of really want to pay attention to is I guess answering the question of how much of a change in HRV has to happen before I should care. And it's hard to answer, right? So let's just say your HRV was 100. I just made that number.\n\nWhat if you wake up tomorrow and it's 99. What's that mean? Well, I don't know. If you wake up tomorrow and it's 20, that's probably a bad thing. Well, where's that line? It's hard. One thing I would recommend doing is taking your HRB for at least a month before you start using that value to make any changes. And you recommend taking it first thing in the morning. Yep. Always roughly the same time. Basically, on the same circumstances. It doesn't have to be technically in the morning, but because your day will change on most days, I want you to get into, that's the most stable thing in your life. So I would take it then and I would collect it for at least a day, at least a month rather, maybe even six weeks, and then give yourself basically a running average. So what we quite honestly do is we will actually track it for forever. And then what we\n\nalways look at is what does it look like today relative to the last week on average? And then what does that look like to our historical average? And we always compare those things. And you also want to make sure you compare like to like. So in other words, I generally will not going to worry about today's HRV score, relative to tomorrow's. What I want to look at is today's relative to this exact same day last week. Not for athletes, but for non athletes. This is very important. So imagine, don't worry about the difference between HRV score and Monday compared to Tuesday. Pay attention to Monday compared to last Monday and the Monday before that.\n\nThat's because you typically have the same sort of weekly schedule. And what you don't want to do is, is say, look at Monday's HRV score, which is a reflection of what happens Sunday. And compare that to Tuesday's, which is actually a reflection of what happened Monday. You probably didn't do the same stressors on Sunday as Monday, so you're not actually comparing the same thing. But if you have a general weekly schedule, you're likely to compare this Monday's, the last Monday's, because they're both comparing what happened on the previous days. So, did that sort of distinction make sense?\n\nAbsolutely. I do the same thing with body weight, by the way, if you're trying to track body, masking or fat loss or something. Compare like the like, you can look at the daily changes, but you need to pay attention to what that normal distribution is. So if you kind of do that, Monday to Monday thing, that'll give you a rough area of saying, okay, my normal weekly variation is say five. So my average is 100, but I will fluctuate between 95 to 105. That's my standard deviation is sort of a science door. So call that. If you start very changing more than 5% outside of your normal standard deviation, then I'm going to start paying attention a little bit.\n\nAnd I'm going to actually run a little bit of an algorithm on this one. And so here is my thinking process when I get HIV, really antimetric, but HIV is the example we're using. First step, did I collect good data? And what I'd add, I mean, again, did I measure it the same way I measured every single day or did I get up and look at my phone first and I realized, oh crap, I forgot to take my HIV\n\nand then I went back, got it there. So say I had a 15% derivation from my normal number and then I realized, oh yeah, that's right, I was up super late last night doing whatever. Okay, great. I'm gonna consider that bad right. I was up super late last night doing whatever. Okay, great. I'm going to consider that bad data. You didn't good. If it's bad data, then I'm not doing anything.\n\nIgnore. Bad data. You throw it out. You don't use it. If you decide for the most part, let's assume it was good data. Okay, great. Then I'm going on on my next question, which is, is it acute? In other words, is it just today, right?\n\nOr is it chronic? In other words, is it just today, right? Or is it chronic? As was this is a pattern been happening for more than five days or at least three at the last four or something like that. Three minimum is what I like, honestly, I generally look at five or more days. That's a very big distinction. If it is something that just happened today\n\nand the next question I'm gonna ask myself is, and I am that adaptation phase. Am I trying to be in a phase where I'm trying to cause insult to the body that it needs to respond with? If that is the case, I'm just going to ignore it. In fact, it's almost sometimes a good sign. Hey, we are stressing the body, and it is stressed. What we're doing is working. Amazing.\n\nIn fact, if you can see that, it's sort of like, maybe we're not doing enough to push the phase. All right, so we're great. If the answer is no, we're in a peaking phase, then we're actually going to use what I call acute state shifters. So this is a whole host of little tricks that I have that can change HRV or any recovery metric within seconds. Again, these are not chronic fixes. This is just I'm having a bad day\n\ntoday. I feel like crap. Can I make myself feel better right now? And so I kind of call these parlor tricks a lot of the times. And there's the thousand of them. We are certainly not going to go over them. But I'll give you some examples. You can pull out, first of all, physical movement. We'll do it. You'd be stunned. I'll just do some yoga, moving around, doing some jumping jacks, starting your workout. I mean, you've probably experienced this. It's sort of cliche in our world at this point.\n\nBut if you ever do any serious lifting over a serious amount of time, there will be days when which you walk into the gym and you feel awful. And somehow that day, you said a lifetime PR. Yeah, that's a strange, strange phenomena. I, uh, I, I experienced that more than a few times. It's rare. The universe is rare. However, you feel great. You have a horrible workout. It happens. Yeah. And it can happen for any number of different reasons. But yeah, I think the the\n\nformer when when isn't feeling very good. And then somehow is a terrific workout does set a kind of a seat of doubt as to how good our subjective assessments really are, which I guess is why we're talking about objective assessments like H.R.B. And remember, if it's\n\na single day here, you can even do hard training. People sort of have this idea like, well, if you get up in your recovery scores down, do a lighter day. That's probably, like I'm probably never making that choice, to be honest, not in this situation. Remember, this is one bad day. And we are in a phase of even trying to improve performance right now. Like we're probably still training hard. You will again, often see, I felt terrible when I trained\n\nsuper hard and it totally changed my day around. This all can happen. So exercise is my first love here. Absolutely breathing, any sort of up regulation breathing. So we talked a lot about down regulation breathing. Just do the opposite, right? And so this is when hyperventilation strategies can work. Instead of accentuating the exhale, you accentuate the inhale or you restrict the exhale.\n\nThis is working in the exact opposite situation. You can also play little, this is where things like music. Motivational quotes, if you're the type that follows people on Instagram that motivates you or can work with these things. Coaching tactics. These can be things like finding out or talking about that person's why. You sort of shared something that a mantra you use when you're training hard to keep you go better. I'm not going to ask you to share that now, but some people have this sometimes, right? Or you may have this conversation with your athlete.\n\nWe call this finding out your why, right? So finding out like, why are you really here? What are we doing here? And a lot of times you'll hear things like, it's because I grew up poor and I don't ever wanna be poor. Okay, great. This is for my children or like any number of things\n\nand you can pull that out on these days. You need to be really careful. This is why I call these parlour tricks. Because when you play that card too often, it starts to lose effect, right? And you can only dig to a hole so often before it's sort of like a... The same thing is with music, right? Every time you go to the weight room, it's blasting death metal at level 10. Well, eventually, it's not... It's no longer motivating, right? It's no longer helpful. So...\n\nYou want to deploy these things, strategic. Yeah, the phrase that comes to mind is signal to noise, you know, the nervous system, especially the dopamine system and the adrenaline system, which are a part of this larger system, called the cataclysmine system. So that's dopamine, epinephrine, epinephrine, the, the get up and go focus on external goals, movement associated, it's an on and on. That, that system responds best to high signal relative to noise. So if you're, as you point out, listening music every time, drinking a ton of caffeine, energy drinks, pre-workout, new tropics, and then stacking all those things, sometimes\n\nrefer to this as dopamine stacking. Informally refer to it as dopamine stacking. You're doing all those things. And then, first of all, then you're wondering why later that afternoon or the next day, you're feeling like you're under a cloud. It was obvious. Your cataclysmine system crashed.\n\nBut it's also that you don't necessarily become dependent on it. It's just that you start to wonder whether or not you have the internal mechanisms and motivation to train without those things. And so one tends to use them more and more and then they have a diminishing effect over time. The rule that I've been sort of applying has been,\n\nI never do two workouts in a row where I'm stacking in stimulants, loud music, and any kind of sort of high potency inspiration. However, every set in the gym or when I run, I really try and be diligent about form and attention to what I'm doing. The one exception would be the long duration endurance work. Part of the reason I do that work is to let my mind go into states of drifting, not trying\n\nto think in complete sentences or even close to it, just let my brain kind of idle at a low hum. And for that reason, generally, listen to something that's up more of a story or don't listen to anything at all and just let my thoughts kind of spool through. Anyway, I don't want to take us too far off track, but I think this idea of signal to noise will resonate with the engineers out there, but since most people are likely not engineers, it is the way that the nervous system works. Evidence by the fact that whatever\n\narea of your body right now is in contact with a chair or any other surface that it's been in contact with for more than a few seconds, you forget that it's in contact with it because there's low signal, the noise at that point. Similar note, you actually mentioned stimulants basically there, whether you're talking caffeine or any other stimulant, any other cortisol modulators or adaptogens, any of these things fall in the category. If you're not using them consistently, and you're having a rough day, and I'll send you throw down 200 milligrams of caffeine,\n\nit's gonna change real fast, the equation. That's a strong performance enhancing effect. Yeah, absolutely, and for these reasons, right? So we mentioned a couple of them, breath work, food, more calories, just eating some food. Sometimes we'll give people what we call comfort foods. So this is just like, hey, you're from Georgia and we know you love grits. So we're having grits for breakfast. Oh my great. Just something to change your mood, acute state shifters to alter it. The other couple of tricks here are light. So\n\nif we know that maybe you see multiple people struggling that day, maybe we'll put on the lights extra bright. We'll bring us some extra things and just get it more light in there. And not they don't even count actually going outside and seeing the sun, but perhaps we'll do that. And then other little tricks that I've learned over the years is one particular thing I love is literally drawing a line, a physical line on the ground. And you look at that line and you say, like, I'm going to train today and I'm going to accomplish this effort.\n\nI'm not going to walk past this line and into that training space until I'm ready to give that effort. And that may take a minute or 10 or whatever. But it's the physical barrier is very important to saying like I'm not just gonna get through it I'm going to actually perform the way I want to perform Or I'm not gonna do it and I'm not gonna cross this line until I'm ready to make that happen I really like that tool It also brings to mind the importance of at least thinking about how your relationship with your phone during training\n\nof at least thinking about how your relationship with your phone during training can perhaps help, but also impede workout motivation and performance. In an earlier episode, you mentioned that if people are using their phone to play music during their workout, that they establish the complete playlist prior to initiating the workout and then not deviate from that playlist as opposed to changing it in the middle because there's just too much of an impulse to also check social media, check email, check text messages. I mean the way I think about the phone actually is it's a bunch of whom brain areas. It's got a memory system for you. It's got lookup tables for lookup tables. It's got websites to look things up on the internet. It's got photos. I mean, it is so rich with sensory data and it's so closely linked to our own brain architecture. The algorithms are designed for those to be that way.\n\nThat I always think about it as bringing in a second person with me, but that person is my twin that has severe attention issues. And for those that already have attention issues, just think about this as a twin that would then compound you by tapping on your shoulder, talking to you all the time, interrupting you. Somebody that you like a lot,\n\nbut that frankly is a little bit irritating in that they're interrupting your ability to really show up and also your ability to show up for them. So I started to think about the phone as an entire individual and that it represents me and certainly not the better version of me. Great. Exactly. You actually mentioned something else that we'll use occasionally which what we call brain games or puzzles. Whether this is a crossword puzzle or something where you actually lose your thought of self for a second, and your brain gets engaged\n\nin a task that you weren't regretting or even thinking about. These can be stupid little games. It could be little challenges, especially if you're in like a group or a team setting. All right, like we're gonna play one round of dodgeball or we're gonna play one round of of thumbwars. So you do encourage this? Yeah, I see. So you would play like a thing instead of warming up, it's like, all right, get in and everyone get going, get your foam roller, your dime, or whatever thing. So it's like, everyone line up and we're going to play thumb-roars to see who wins, right?\n\nJust like whatever, right? And also, you've snapped into a new mental shift or literally playing brain games, playing Tetris on your phone. Like any of these things can work in this acute setting. Can I ask you a question? It's not directly related to recovery per se, but I think it's worth mentioning or asking about rather, which is the use of mirrors or no mirrors while training. You know, the experience of seeing oneself and observing one's form in the mirror, I suppose, has some utility. You can get some sense of progress that you might trigger. You're almost specifically referring to resistance training. I suppose it could\n\nbe cardio if you're running on a treadmill or pushing a slider or something, but you can see form. You can get a sense of what your face looks like when you grimace, but in all seriousness, like when you grimace, but in all seriousness, you are without question a person, not you Andy, but one is in a less interoceptive mode when looking at themselves in the mirror. So the extra-oception, perception of things beyond the confines of our skin, even if it's a picture of us,\n\ninter-oception, perception of everything from the skin inward. And so if we're looking at ourselves, we're diverting some allocation of our attention. Let's say there's a hundred, these are arbitrary units, and you can think put 50% of your attention on the feeling in your body or the muscles you're training, and 50% on how it appears in the mirror, or it could be 100% on the mirror, 100% internally, which you best accomplish probably by closing your eyes. So obviously there are constraints here, certain movements, you wouldn't want to close your\n\neyes, etc. In general, what are your thoughts on mirrors or no mirrors for resistance training specifically? It depends on the metric that you find most important. And what I mean by this is if you're training for same muscle hypertrophy, there's emerging evidence that suggests actually looking at yourself in the mirror and even flexing in between sets can actually be advantageous or can augment muscle gains.\n\nOh my, there's support for all the mirror flexors. Absolutely. Not making fun of you. I just, this is sort of interesting to be on the observing side of that. But hey, listen, results are what people are after. Yeah. Having said that, if you're trying to enhance, um, movement learning, then it may be detrimental. Uh, so if you're doing an exercise that is explosive and fast, it's probably not the best thing to be looking into a mirror. Um, if you were to walk into any Olympic weightlifting, uh,\n\narena and you had any thoughts of using a mirror, you would probably run out of the gym very quickly. You can't see yourself in time to make an adjustment with the movement that's happening that fast. And also, we'll do exactly what you mentioned, which is we'll remove your ability to understand and feel the movement. And so this is a big component to using technology for exercise at all, is you have to make sure\n\nthat the end point is you understanding you and your physiology more, not less. When you outsource learning to technology, and in this case, even if the technology is the mirror, you remove your ability to gain and truly understand that learning process. So you need to be very, very careful whether you're using a mirror or whether you're using any number of apps where you can record, say, a movement, and then watch it afterwards\n\nand it will give you a breakdown if your hand was in the right spot or if it was in the right spot. These are all great. But you need to then take the next step, which is to say, I need to be able to feel that position. So in the case of performance, if you can imagine trying to learn a new technique, say, running technique, and you have to be able to watch yourself in the mirror to understand your stride in the right position. If you don't take the next step of saying, okay, now I don't have to look in the mirror and I can feel when I'm getting out of rhythm or whatever the case is. Then you'll never be able to actually then use that in your race. And so it's very, very important that people, again, pay attention to what is the dependent\n\nvariable that you're actually interested in doing. And if you're trying to get better at something, the tech is okay as a starting place. It just cannot be the finishing place. Thank you for those reflections. I'm curious as to what happens or what one should do if their HRV is reduced for maybe three or four or more days in a row. Absolutely. The next question that I'm going to ask is, and am I in that adaptation phase? If so, I'm going to still ignore it just like I did if it was a single bad day, but I'm going to start watching it very carefully. I may actually now introduce some other tests, so I may use a performance test.\n\nWe may look at something else, maybe ask questions, maybe have some communication, either with myself or somebody else. So I'm going to start paying more attention, but I'm still really not going to take much action until that crosses more than seven days of consistent problems. If it does do that, or we're in a peaking phase, then I'm gonna go to another set of solutions that are truly going to pull me out of the hole rather than just be those acute state shifters.\n\nThese are more what I call chronic state shifters. Now, some of these are actually very similar to the ones we've used before. For example, thermal stress. So I can promise you, if your recovery score is in the tanks and you walk outside and you jump in your 35 degree water and you get back out, what's going to happen is your HRV score immediately afterwards. I'm talking within seconds is going to be significantly compromised.\n\nIn other words, think about that remember a low HRV means a high sympathetic. I promise you cold water will push you in a high sympathetic drive. However, and we've tested this pretty extensively. Looking at HRV zero 15 30 60 90 all the way up to 180 minutes. And on average, you will see your HRV score continue to rise after that. And so, well, you have this immediate sympathetic response. You will immediately then respond, about 30 minutes on most people, depends on the person though. And that score will be improved\n\nfor several hours afterwards. So, heath can kind of have a similar effect. That actually, again, is sort of an acute fix, but over time, as we've described earlier, I can also have a little bit of a chronic effect. We can also then get into areas like sleep. And so now we're gonna start playing and exploring why are you sleeping poor as well?\n\nOr was your sleep score fine, but your HRV was low? That's a little bit of a different answer. If your sleep is getting compromised, then we're gonna start going into and making sure we're improving our sleep. In terms of like brain stuff, instead of maybe playing a game or having music or some of these other tricks, those aren't gonna really have a chronic effect.\n\nBut you can do things like work on social connection. That's actually been shown to improve recovery over time. You can do things like journaling or meditation and those have an acute effect as well as a chronic effect. So again, if you go journal right now, you probably feel better, but also we know that over time that will gradually improve things.\n\nSo, adaptogens and things like that also can have a chronic effect. So, can things like electrolytes or food or hydration, if those things were off. So, we're going to go to a whole number of areas, but those are the primary ones, outstanding of all that, of course, it may be simply a time to go back and reassess our training program. That's truly the case. So that's where we're at. If so, we're probably going to either completely remove training or drop it to like 50% or so until we start rebounding back to baseline. And that's generally the numbers we use. For many people who are not training for a competitive sport and maybe aren't pushing themselves really hard, you know, maybe they're, they're considered themselves, somebody who exercises in order to maintain health, anesthetics and\n\nlongevity, et cetera. And they never really finish any workout completely exhausted. They're sleeping okay, they're appetite's okay. Can we assume that they are recovering well or maybe they're not creating enough of an adaptation response? Like there's no progressive overreaching. And so there's really no stimulus for recovery. What I'm saying here is on the face of it, I think, is obvious, right? If you don't train hard, there's nothing to recover from. What I'm really saying is, is the ability to recover itself, something that we need to train.\n\nIn other words, can we get better at recovering? And the analogy here would be something like focus in order to perform work of any kind, but certainly mental work and physical work. We need to be able to focus. The ability to focus is the reflection of a bunch of neural circuits and chemicals and hormones, et cetera, but we know roughly what those are.\n\nAnd we know that if you are poor at focusing, for every small bit of time that you can focus a little bit longer, even if it's a matter of seconds, those circuits themselves get better at focusing, and so on and so forth. So in other words, is the recovery system, however broad, neurotransmitter, hormones, neural, muscular, immune-based, et cetera. Can that system or set of systems become better? Can we get better at recovering? Can we mean, can it become faster and more effective? Can we think of the recovery system as kind of a blade that gets sharper by engaging recovery?\n\nBecause if so, then there's strong reason for people who are not pushing really hard to push at least a little bit harder than is comfortable for them every once in a while to make sure that that system doesn't start to slide back. Remember physiology is listening to everything you do and it is always responding. So the analogy that I will meet your analogy with that I use here is the bowling alley. So you've probably been bowling before and you've used the bumper lanes, right? The bumper lanes.\n\nI've gone bowling before and I've spent time in the gutter and I've spent time on the pins. Okay. So it's been a while. We used to have a bowling alley in the townway when two, and it was fun. We used to slide around on those shoes and like all the kids would hang out there.\n\nAnd I feel like do they still have bowling alley? I don't even know. It feels like something that may have gone the way of the mid 2000s. I don't care if no one bills anymore. You're not going to ruin my good analogy. OK, well, what my intent wasn't to ruin your analogy. OK, toss about bowling.\n\nAll the bowlers are going to come after me with bowling balls or something. Right, you're going to get blasted with all the stats and elevations. Don't hurt me. Sorry, that was so cool. So if one were to go bowlinged with all the stats and elevations. Don't hurt me. Cool. So if one were to go bowling and they didn't want to put their ball on the gutter, you\n\ncould put these little bumpers in those lanes. All right. And these little foam pads that go on the gutter that if your ball is going towards the gutter, it hits those and bounces off and goes back in the lane. Right. Okay. So in this entire conversation, and this is actually true of a lot of the way people approach their fitness and health, people are very concerned oftentimes with optimizing, meaning I want\n\nto make sure I don't go in the gutter. I don't want to hit the walls. So therefore, I'm going to try to improve the accuracy in which I throw the ball. So I want to make sure that I'm throwing it down the center of the lane more often. And I want to get my standard deviation tighter and tighter so that I don't get anywhere close to hitting the wall. However, what they're not realizing is if you do that, the body will start shrinking the size of the lane. Because what it basically says is, huh, we haven't had a ball touch us in years. We don't need to be this wide.\n\nLet's get smaller and smaller and smaller. So it's not that you actually are having a reduced ability to recover, but you start becoming incredibly sensitive to that. So your two strategies for enhancing recovery are to practice getting closer, throwing that ball down the middle of the land, or to widen the alley. That's exactly what you're referring to.\n\nAnd you absolutely should do that. And so what happens is you don't have to be so precise with what you're doing because your ability to handle so many things is widen. So if you're off now by four or five inches to the right, no problem because you've just tripled the size of your alley. That's exactly what you want to do. So paying attention to two things. Number one is getting better at accuracy. Maybe staying really tight with your progressions. Using nutrition and sleep to optimize your recovery and push your resilience. This is what we call this. In fact, there's actually a biological way to measure resilience. We do that in all of our folks.\n\nThis is scientifically validated stuff. I didn't just make it up, you can actually measure resilience. And there's more and more coming out on this, but that's exactly what that term means. So how well can you handle and bang things off the threshold? So when you see a reduction in, say, 10% of your HRV today, for you, that may make you feel terrible. For me, I might not feel anything because I'm well adapted to large fluctuations and therefore I'm okay.\n\nThe less and less you do that, the more and more responsive you will be to those slight deviations. So that is exactly the target. That's kind of what I look to and I say you got to understand what are we optimizing for. We're optimizing for making sure I don't feel any different today. Are we optimizing to make sure when I do feel different, I still am able to perform. So this is why you want to do things like maybe use some caffeine today and feel great. But if I have to use it every day, all I'm doing is shrinking my sensitivity there.\n\nSo now if I have to go a day without it, I can't train at all. Right? Caffeine is the easy example because people understand how that holds the system work. But this is really true of everything else. So yeah, you need to practice this. And the way to do that is to give yourself more stress. To continue to bring in the stress from nutrition, from training, from breath work. You mentioned earlier about focus. The exact same thing, right, it's not just about getting better right now. It's about training a system, and you can clearly train that, right?\n\nWe will often say, breath work is a practice. That's exactly what we're talking about, right? So you're practicing getting better at these things. You're practicing returning your things. You're practicing returning your focus. You're practicing recovering and quite literally physiologically you can upregulate whether we're talking enzymes whether we're talking about regulators. These will be up-regulated so then the next time that that insult comes in, it's not as big as as damaging. So yeah, absolutely you can and you should strive for that.\n\nThroughout all the episodes where we've been talking about exercise because it's not as damaging. So yeah, absolutely you can and you should strive for that. Throughout all the episodes where we've been talking about exercise, at the core of that is this word adaptations. And I love that you mentioned that breath work can also create adaptations. The way I'm visualizing all of this now is that resistance training with weights machines body weight otherwise\n\ncardiovascular training running jogging sprinting jumping and so on thermal training exposure to heat exposure to cold in a dedicated way and Deliverate respiration a K breathing or breath work as a practice. All of those can be viewed as ways to trigger adaptations. And in the context of recovery, the specific adaptations you're trying to engage are opposite to stress. In fact, with the exception of perhaps deliberate cold exposure, maybe deliberate heat exposure, because if the sauna is really hot, you can get the dinorphin release, which is kind of uncomfortable. But still, in both those cases, the rebound from that, in other words, when you get out\n\nof your shower, you go to bed the next morning, you do have this kind of blissed out feeling, we know why that is, that is the rebound to that uncomfortable situation. So it seems it doesn't really matter whether or not you're using resistance, you're doing cardiovascular training, using thermal approaches, or you're using respiration based approaches. All of these are really ways of both triggering adaptations and if applied properly to actually help you recover from the stress and create the the literal result that you're trying to achieve. For some people that might have been obvious, but I think for many people, including myself, this set of conversations that we've been having over the series\n\nthese episodes, it's really the first time that I've ever thought about exercise in these ways. In any event, it's just a reflection, but it's one that at least for me is tremendously useful because it has a lot of organizational logic to it, which at least appeals to my brain because the more that things have a logic, the more for me that they become simplified and the more that the vast array of tools becomes visible to me. As you said earlier, what is it? Let me make sure I get this right. It's concepts are few methods or many. Pretty close. Okay.\n\nHow would you, Ruin, is how you state it? Methods or many concepts are few. Ah, go okay. Either way, the directionality probably. It doesn't matter. No, let's keep it right. The methods or many concepts are few. Galpins law.\n\nIn science, you're not allowed to name things after yourself, but you can him think after other people. So it's a Galpins law. Because I'm definitely the one who created that idea. So absolutely. That was extreme and tremendous sarcasm to Soar Ultra. Regardless, here we go, Galpins law. There you go. One thing that's in my head right now is we've thrown out a lot of options for folks. And maybe what we can do is try to simplify a little bit. So what I can kind of walk you through is how we measure recovery, if you will, and how often and some tools. And what I would recommend people do is not use everything I said. You want to pick one or two things for category\n\nthat are most important to you, that are at your cost, that are at your availability, that are interesting and important relevant to you, and do that. The reason I kind of wanted to cover a large number of things was to give them a folks options, but again, I want to emphasize the point\n\nis to not measure all of them. In fact, you don't need to. We, I've run this before with professional athletes where we've taken blood, urine, every single day. We've done performance measures, vertical jumps on a force plate, a whole bunch of things, every day for years on end. And what I can tell you is there is tremendous redundancy in physiology, right? Everything is everything.\n\nSo you don't need to do them and don't feel like you're missing out if you aren't doing them. One or two metrics is probably fine. I generally recommend one subjective measure. This could be as simple as what's your mood. How do you feel today? Great. And one objective measure, HRV,\n\nresting heart rate, anything else, right? So if you even literally just did that, you'd probably have pretty good insight as to what you're doing. So maybe in fact I'll go more detail here. Maybe I'll give you a couple of examples of things to measure every day, some things that you should measure maybe quarterly, monthly, and then maybe even some annually. And then you can maybe just pick a couple for me to this category and have yourself a pretty good monitoring system for what to do.\n\nAnd I'll include some that are a little bit of technology base and then others that are totally cost-free and require nothing. OK, to start off, I would recommend taking something like HRV every day or most days. If you don't have a device like that, you could also use, honestly, the CO2 tolerance test. We've talked about that a number of times, and we probably have plenty of research to go find that, but that doesn't require anything. It typically takes about a minute or so, and you can do that under the same circumstances\n\nin which HRV, in other words, do it the same time every day, have the same standardization stuff, and that is actually been in our coaching experience. While admittedly, there is no peer reviewed research on this yet. Just in our experience, this tends to track extremely closely with HRV and other metrics of recovery. In fact, we actually did do a pilot trial in my lab and it attract decently well with both state and trading anxiety. So it's a nice metric. Not perfect, but you could take that. So if you wanted, you could do both.\n\nBut again, remember, you're trying to capture systemic stress. And so you're really just showing your measuring one thing two ways. So you don't necessarily have to have them both. I will do both just because I'm super interested in small differences but globally they're going to tell you basically the same thing. So those are two things we'll use again basically daily, you're around or close to it.\n\nIf you want to go past that a little bit, you can look at you can use an actual a a pretty old You can use an actual, a pretty old commonly used survey called Adalda, D-A-L-D-A. I forget the exact acronym, but it is a fairly lengthy questionnaire, and it accounts for things like how do you feel today, how do you sleep, any stressors going on in your life, how you've been eating, and it's this is like fairly comprehensive lengthy survey that came out, I mean, Jesus, probably been around for 30 years or something is, it's nothing new and been used extensively. I, you would not want to do that every day. If you wanted to take some subjective measures every day, we typically stick with, like I\n\nsaid, mood, motivation, something like that. You could perform this to all the tests, to test something more like monthly or at the end of each training phase, you know, every couple of months and probably worth looking at. It's not going to tell you if you're in a bad spot today or tomorrow, but you would pick that up with the HRV or suit to tolerance test. It would though tell you information, especially if you're working with another individual about major life changes and if anything it just facilitates that conversation. I noticed you reported X happening. Let's talk about that and can I help? Another kind of sneaky helpful one is this is simply body fat. Like I said, non-functional overreaching and overtraining are associated with a number of things\n\nlike energy, appetite, suppression, changes in body weight or body composition. So you can measure that monthly or even really quarterly depending on what kind of athlete or individual you're working at or if you're trying to, especially if you're not trying to lose weight or if you're trying to be at maintenance. And that'll give you some insights as well. So moving past that now, actually, we're going to move into the realm of things that we call hidden stressors.\n\nSo those are all visible stressors. So hidden stressors, the most common ones we've sort of mentioned, and I would probably do this, well you're going to have to do these ones through serum, so this is blood work. Cortisol, like we talked about in testosterone, then of course testosterone, of cortisol ratio, and then the other ones I mentioned. You can do those quarterly. It's not bad. There are some blood markers that there's really no sense to do them that soon. And there are other markers, I mean, in our system, our individuals are getting\n\npretty extensive blood work, saliva work, urine and stool. And so there's plenty of those things. You just do not need to measure, you know, every 10 weeks or so. Uh, in this case, you know, cortisol, weeks or so. In this case, you know, cortisol, as you know, sort of changes rapidly. Testosterone can change pretty quickly, but if you're really trying to notice a large trend, you know, certainly quarterly or so is an appropriate time frame. I'm doing it every four or five weeks is probably unnecessary, so you can save yourself some money and do that.\n\nOther stuff you can look at, actually, more like semi-annually in plasma, like glutamine and glutamine to glutamate ratio. And it can maybe save that why you want to look at those for another conversation. But those are important. We always look at something from the oxidative stress thing. So this could be something like TNFL or in Erluchen 6, something like that. Again, we're looking at that in serum and we're looking at that semi-annually. And then another sneaky actually one that I love to look at is the Nutrophil de lymphocyte\n\nratio, which would give you some pretty good insight. And again, you could look at that fairly quarterly. If that number starts to get really high, certainly like more than 9 to 1, you got a pretty good insight that something gnarly is going on with your immune system. So we will actually take action much lower than that number, but that's like a nice cutoff you'll see is like that's a very, very high number. So those are some things you can use. Most folks have the ability, hopefully, to get some basic blood work done, get a basic what's called a CBC and CMP. If you have a great physician and you can get insurance to cover that and you just go on and ask for a CBC and CMP, they'll know what that means.\n\nYou can Google that and they'll order it and you'll get all the information typically that I just described or close enough and you'll get some insights. And then again, you can just use that free service I mentioned earlier to check to see whether or not the changes are just a matter of testing quality or actually physiologically relevant. What you just described is an amazingly powerful array of tools. I'm hoping that you can also mention a few tools that are either lower cost, truly low cost, or zero cost, that while they may not have the accuracy\n\nor give the complete picture that some of the biomarkers and other tools that you mentioned do, that they can still provide reasonably reliable metrics that people can use in order to assess their level of recovery. Absolutely. The CO2 tolerance test would be the first one, and you can just take that metric anytime you'd like. The other ones we've talked about so far are things like your mood.\n\nWe haven't mentioned libido, but that's another assessment that people also tend to have a pretty good grip on and they know what feels normal. So when things go out of whack, it tends to be a pretty good signal that people will recognize. Yeah, and one note about that,\n\nsomething that came up in an episode on hormones, both for male and female health, that at some point will air, which is that there's no objective measure for people in terms of libido across the board, meaning people very tremendously age, life circumstances, and on and on. And so this is one of those subjective measures that I think people need to have some sense\n\nof what their quote unquote baseline really is. And I'm guessing that the time to assess that might best be when initiating or midway through a relatively low intensity training phase, maybe during the time of year in which all the other factors that can influence libido are not at their maximum. So if you think about light and dopamine and the relationship between those and the testosterone estrogen systems, we know that libido, testosterone estrogen and men and women\n\ntends to peak in the summer months. So if that's your baseline that you're comparing to, I don't know that that's as reliable as picking something like the fall or the spring. And so anyway, this again is very subjective, but we just encourage people to recognize that there's no standard numbers for this, no lookup table, and there's no equivalent of the libido BMI, the LMI,\n\nthere's respect to the the acronym that probably is LMI. So I think that it's just something to keep in mind as people do comparisons or subjective comparisons is don't pick a comparison to an extreme, try and pick a comparison to a average as you know it to be. That actually sort of reminded me one issue that we have seen a lot lately is people if they're having libido issues or just even slightly noticing a drop, they just assume that then therefore means their testosterone is crashing.\n\nAnd those things are certainly connected, but that is not necessarily the case. And where that becomes a problem is then people then go on things like TRT, et cetera, with no true oversight and then all kinds of other problems. So make sure that if you're going to take that step that you actually get to testosterone measured and you're working with a qualified person to guide you through that process, don't just assume because you're having low energy or your libido is a little bit down, it could be simply training related, it could be sleep related, it could be any number of things. So that's like a little bit of a word of caution there. Two quick points along the lines of what you just said.\n\nOne interesting thing that I learned when researching our episode on testosterone and estrogen optimization, this was an episode that we've done some time ago, but it's still available in our cubermanlab.com, all formats, et cetera, is that many people actually increase their libido and even their levels of testosterone and estrogen as they progress from their 20s into their 40s, if they take excellent care of themselves, including the correct exercise adaptations, correct body fat to lean muscle ratios. But of course, they can go the other way too. A lot of people can be training to achieve such low body fat stores that libido can suffer. So, you know, the age-related declines in libido are not necessarily written into the script\n\nof life. In fact, there are some data points from a really interesting paper I talk about in that episode of individuals, this was a study focused on males in their 80s and 90s who maintained total and free testosterone as high as individuals in their 20s. But then when you look at the lifestyle factors of those people in their 80s and 90s, they were doing a lot to create that scenario.\n\nThe second point is one related to what you just said, which is very true, which is people generally tend to assume that a drop in libido is related to a drop in testosterone, and then assume that they need to increase their testosterone. And in some cases that is true. Absolutely. But it's also often the case that people who take estrogen or aromatase blockers, that is enzyme inhibitors that prevent the conversion of testosterone to estrogen, experience severe deficits in libido\n\nbecause of estrogen to low. So estrogen blockers are as much an issue here as low testosterone. And then the final point is also one that many people now, men and women are, I think need to be aware of, which is that dihydro testosterone, DHT, is among the more powerful androgens for output, physical power output, but also for libido, and DHT is strongly inhibited by certain things like turmeric. So a lot of people who are taking a high doses of turmeric can experience\n\ndrops in libido. So they're and who are taking various compounds to prevent hair loss. Yep. Things like finasteride. So there's a whole catalog of things that can reduce libido that are not directly in the testosterone pathway. They can be a D.H.E. Relator, estrogen related. And this think, points to the importance of, yes, take a subjective measure of your libido. Pay attention, essentially be aware. Don't obsess, but be aware and try and figure out what factors are involved for you.\n\nBut don't immediately assume that what's needed is more testosterone, and oftentimes the opposite is the case. Yeah, try to put on a lot of muscle with no estrogen. Good luck. Right, and indeed a lot of athletes in particular, you know, competitive buy-billars that have that, you know, saran wrap thin skin. If you get to know some of those people\n\nand you talk to them, they can look like the sort of comic book archetype of what someone might want to be. I mean, that's not what this discussion or these episodes have been about, but oftentimes they can have serious libido issues. I mentioned earlier and I will emphasize it once more. You need to be very cautious when you're taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, cortisol reducers for all those reasons, right?\n\nI didn't really sort of get an example, but you just nailed another fantastic reason of it. We do not give those things prophylactically. I strongly discourage people from just walking around taking supplementation of antioxidants, especially powerful ones for no reason. If you have done some testing\n\nand you have a good reason to do so, I'm fine. Or if you're in a very specific, say, training phase or something like that, cool. But if you're just walking around doing that, you are oftentimes not always, but you're oftentimes causing problems that then you then try to solve by taking more of those anti-inflammatories. I feel terrible, low energy, low libido, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm too inflamed, et cetera. So, yeah, antioxidants in the form of food are fantastic. Almost no issue.\n\nThere is a good evidence actually there. So don't worry about men. I shouldn't eat high antioxidant rich foods. You're gonna be fine. What we're talking about here is pharmaceuticals and supplementation, where you can take orders of magnitude higher dosages very quickly than you could in the presence of food. So that distinction is also very important. Antioxidant rich foods are generally fine and that's consumed in totally absurd concentrations. Supplementations, powder,\n\ncreams, drugs, etc. is where you can get into problems. So yeah, you want to be very careful of doing that unless you have a reason. We don't do that unless we see a reason to do so in someone's markers. Yeah, and herbal compounds, despite the fact that their herbal can be quite potent modulators of hormones, astral gondub being an example to herbal compounds that we've talked a lot about\n\non our podcast before and repeatedly, including in that testosterone and gastroenin optimization episode, Tonga Ali and Fidoji Aggressis, Tonga Ali is now taken by a large number of men and women. Tonga Ali and Fidoji are typically men. I'm not sure that there are any good studies about the effects of Fodogia in women. Those are herbal compounds that can have potent effects in increasing testosterone and luteinizing hormone.\n\nDo they work? Yeah, they work to varying degrees in most everybody, not certainly not in everybody, but they do work, but they work because they're potent. They have effects. So the idea that herbal compounds are not powerful is wrong. And it's important to remember that that can cut both ways. Hence, my mention of this observation related to turmeric, which is not to say that some people can't take turmeric\n\nand feel perfectly fine, maintain, or even increase their libido. That I'm sure that can happen. It's just that for people that are very DHT sensitive, this tends to be an issue. So, unfortunately, for many of these compounds, the only way to find out is really to try them, or to just completely avoid them in this idea. You don't want to try them as fine too, but there really aren't ways to predict who will respond, who won't, and who will be hyper responders. And in that case, it's a bit of a, it's a little bit of a wild west. I'm also sort of remembering what the point of this conversation was supposed to be.\n\nAnd maybe I'll return back to that, which was some cost free or low cost metrics. That was a very fun tangent. But nonetheless, another couple of ones you can do are grip strength testing. So if you can buy a fairly cheap hand grip dynamometer on any number of places, these are typically able to be purchased for $20 to $40 or something like that, right? You can actually just test that every day. I've done that in a number of athletes for a decent amount of time. Admittedly, I don't do it anymore. And that's not because\n\nI disagree with it, but because we just were getting the information already, and it was just too redundant. But if that's the only option, it is a great one to do. I mentioned also earlier how I actually like speed tests, over strength tests as an earlier indication of overreaching. And so because of that, I like a vertical jump test. If you have access to a force plate, that's great. And then you can get more in-depth characteristics of the force velocity curve and acceleration\n\nand things like that. Use the lot in high performance situations. If not, simply looking at your performance. And so you can kind of go back to one of our earlier episodes when I described coloring my fingertips with highlighters earlier in my life. And you could do the same thing and go out in your garage and every day jump up and touch that marker and see where you're at.\n\nAnd so a system like that could be done. You can also use tools like a force transducer and do a standard movement, I can say a vertical jump or a high pole or something like that and measure the velocity and just compare that day to a standard load. So you do it every single time with the same load. Similar thing could be done with like a medicine ball throw. So you have the same ball, you throw the same thing and this sort of where you're at today. You want to do a little bit of warm up but not excessive here. You want to kind of get an idea of where your baseline is and you don't want to influence it by the veracity of the warmup every single day because that alone can change it. Same thing with stretching.\n\nAcute static stretching. Directly influences power production. So you don't want to go out there and one day do a 20 minute stretch before, then the other day, you didn't stretch at all because that alone will cause Deviations in your performance. So try to keep everything you can think of standardize and That'll give you a little bit better data. Remembering all of these values The biomarkers a performance stuff. They have normal variations You just want to figure out first and foremost what those normal variations are for you. So you have your normal number, you have your standard deviation. When you start getting outside of that standard deviation, you start paying attention. And\n\nso that's kind of like what we typically call that the gray zone. And so if it's in the gray zone, we're fine. We're not adjusting. But if it's outside of that, whatever that is for you, recognizing that the gray zone is smaller for some folks and larger for others, but what is normal for you and your situation, and then you can make your decisions outside of that when you see numbers that are consistently or more than three to five days in a row or close, four to last five days, four to last six, something like that, then you maybe have some cause for action. Well, that was an incredible description\n\nof the various tools and modes for recovery. And I realize I jumped the gun a bit during our discussion about food and supplements, but I like to think that serves as a nice precursor to the next episode, which is going to be all about nutrition and supplementation.

          "snippet": "\u201cCardio will ruin your gains!\u201d We\u2019ve all heard some version of this phrase from a veteran of the iron game. Right or wrong, the idea that cardio will negatively affect\n\n**strength and hypertrophy adaptations** from lifting has persisted for the better part of a century and has been dubbed the **interference effect**. This idea is so pervasive in strength and bodybuilding communities that many lifters are missing out on the many health benefits and fitness adaptations properly dosed conditioning can provide.\n\nAll the while, the \u201c\n\n**hybrid athlete\u201d** has emerged. Many popular training programs are delivering robust results while combining endurance and strength training together. This hybrid form of training has become the new gold standard in the fitness industry. CrossFit and Hyrox are as popular as ever, and seemingly every influencer has become a shill for \u201cBig Zone-2 Cardio.\u201d\n\nCardio is cool again, which is cool! But, little attention is being paid to the interference effect \u2013 how strength and endurance training affect one another. This article will cover what the interference effect is, what the science says about combining lifting and cardio together, and how to practically apply these concepts to your own training to get the most fitness out of your training.\n\n## Defining the Interference Effect of Concurrent Training\n\nThe interference effect is defined as reduced strength and/or hypertrophy gains when resistance and endurance training are combined together in the same exercise program. The first use of the term \u201cinterference effect\u201d in this context dates back to 1980 when Dr. Robert Hickson showed that untrained men had reduced strength development with\n\n**concurrent** training, or combined strength and endurance training, when compared to resistance training alone. 1\n\nIn this view, endurance training \u201cinterferes\u201d with the adaptations from resistance training when both forms of exercise are done in the same program.\n\nWhat explains Dr. Hickson\u2019s findings? And, have those findings been repeated over the last 45 years? Let\u2019s explore some potential mechanisms that explain this effect.\n\n## Potential Mechanisms: What Causes the Concurrent Training Interference Effect?\n\nFirst, some definitions. Exercise is a type of physical activity that is planned, repetitive, and structured with the goal of improving or maintaining health or fitness. Conditioning is an umbrella term that refers to exercise designed to improve endurance performance and cardiorespiratory fitness, both of which rely on the ability of the heart, lungs, and circulatory system (blood vessels) to support muscular function at a given level for a relatively long period of time. In contrast, resistance training is a form of physical activity where muscles create force via contraction against a load, which may be external (barbell) or internal (bodyweight) to the individual to create increases in strength and/or muscular hypertrophy.\n\nAdaptations to exercise are specific to the type of exercise performed. You wouldn\u2019t expect your 1RM squat to increase from an endurance swimming program just like you wouldn\u2019t expect heavy squat training to significantly improve your swimming performance.\n\nConditioning and resistance training drive different adaptations through different pathways because they are limited by different processes. Aerobic exercise is limited by the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems\u2019 capacity to to supply the working muscle with energy and remove waste products, whereas resistance training is limited by neuromuscular excitability and the ability of the muscle to produce force.\n\nSubsequently, aerobic exercise drives adaptations predominantly concerned with the circulatory system and the working muscles\u2019 ability to extract oxygen, whereas resistance training drives adaptations related to the muscles and associated soft tissues (bones, tendons, ligaments, etc.), as well as the nerves, to improve force production.\n\nNow, there is some overlap between the two, particularly in untrained individuals. If you are starting out with very low levels of fitness, the cardiovascular demands of lifting weights can provide modest improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness.\n\n2 , 3 Similarly, aerobic training can produce some strength and hypertrophy improvements in the working muscles for people with very low baseline strength levels, though not nearly as well as resistance training. 4 , 5\n\nThe important thing to note here is that the adaptations made are only what is required. For example, if you were previously sedentary your legs will get stronger from a running program \u2013 but only strong enough to support running. Similarly, if you start at low baseline cardiovascular fitness levels then lifting weights will improve your conditioning \u2013 but only enough to support lifting weights.\n\nSo, how do these different training modalities that produce different fitness adaptations interact or interfere with one another?\n\n### Mechanism 1: Competing Signaling Pathways (mTOR vs. AMPK)\n\nThe most popular mechanism for an interference effect has to do with competing pathways involved in the body\u2019s response to different types of exercise. For example, many resistance training adaptations depend on activation of the\n\n**Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) **pathway to drive increases in **muscle protein synthesis (MPS)**. Increases in MPS are required for building muscle. There is some research that shows inhibition of this pathway when resistance training is combined with aerobic exercise, particularly if cardio is performed prior to resistance training. 6 , Additionally, there is data showing that concurrent training may reduce satellite cell signaling, which is involved in muscle remodeling and repair after lifting weights. 7\n\nEndurance training activates a different metabolic pathway \u2013 the\n\n**AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)** pathway. When activated, this pathway restores cellular energy balance when intra-cellular ATP levels are lowered. ATP is the high-energy molecule that working muscles use to perform physical activity. After endurance training when large amounts of cellular energy are used to perform the exercise the body activates this pathway to restore energy levels back to resting values. 13\n\nIt is thought that the mTOR pathway and AMPK pathway cannot be active at the same time and they have conflicting effects. Building muscle takes energy, it is an\n\n**anabolic process**. After lifting weights, mTOR is activated and energy goes towards building muscle while we recover from the training session. During and after endurance training. AMPK is activated in an effort to create energy (ATP) via upregulating **catabolic processes**, and inhibiting anabolic processes like mTOR.\n\nThe goals of these two pathways seem conflicting \u2013 if the body is trying to recover from endurance training why would it spend energy on building muscle? This interference of one pathway on another is the crux of the explanation behind Dr. Hickson\u2019s original experiment back in the 1980s. How can the body do two conflicting things at once?\n\nWhile studying mechanisms can be worthwhile and valuable in the formulation of hypotheses, it is crucial to study the effects of these mechanisms in real humans performing real training programs. Current evidence suggests that the\n\n**acute activation of AMPK** can transiently inhibit **mTOR** immediately after a workout, but **long-term data suggests this effect does not significantly compromise muscle growth** when proper recovery and programming are used. This weakens the mechanistic explanation as the primary cause of interference, as discussed in an upcoming section.\n\nBefore we get there however, let\u2019s examine another potential mechanism.\n\n### Mechanism 2: Total Training Load and Excessive Fatigue\n\nA second mechanism for explaining the interference effect purports that when people add conditioning to their resistance training program, the increase in total training load outstrips their ability to adequately recover. As a result, the training adaptations such as strength, hypertrophy, and muscular power improvements are reduced compared to lifting-only programs.\n\nThe fitness-fatigue paradigm states that the larger the training stimulus, the more potential fitness it can create. It also states that the larger the training stimulus, the more fatigue it can generate. So there must always be a balance with total training load. We want a training load that delivers a large stimulus to produce adaptations like hypertrophy, strength, or increased aerobic capacity but we also need to be able to recover from the program.\n\nLet\u2019s say a lifter is currently lifting weights 5 days per week. If they suddenly decide to begin conditioning and try to meet the current physical activity guidelines recommendation of 150 minutes of moderate intensity per week they would be adding a significant chunk of volume to their program. Volume that may exceed their current recovery capacity. In this scenario, the addition of conditioning would certainly lessen results in the immediate to short term.\n\nTraining stress and recovery are challenging to measure objectively and can vary significantly from person to person. Training volumes that supersede recovery capacity could be achieved with lifting only and endurance only training programs. In both of those scenarios, you would expect reduced performance due to exceeding recovery capacity. So it is crucial to maintain a training volume that does not cause a reduction in performance.\n\nIn this view, the absolute training volume interferes with results \u2013 not the metabolic pathways blocking one another.\n\nFrom a theoretical standpoint, these mechanisms support the interference effect. Could the combination of competing metabolic pathways and a high total workload interfere with gains?\n\nBetter questions are: how big is the interference effect and does it play out in real humans performing real training programs?\n\nFor this, we look at the studies performed in humans.\n\n## What the Science Says: Is the Concurrent Training Interference Effect Real?\n\nBased on existing data looking at concurrent training versus lifting-only programs, there\u2019s little concern for an interference effect unless total workload exceeds recovery status, particularly for untrained individuals.\n\nThree recent meta-analyses found that concurrent training\n\n**did not compromise strength or hypertrophy gains significantly** when compared to lifting-only programs. 8 , 9 , 12\n\nSchumann\n\n* et al.* concluded that: *\u201cConcurrent aerobic and strength training does not compromise muscle hypertrophy and maximal strength development. However, explosive strength gains may be attenuated, especially when aerobic and strength training are performed in the same session.\u201d * 9 *(emphasis added)*\n\nWith respect to high velocity strength, or power, a more recent study found that concurrent aerobic and strength training does not reduce maximal strength, explosive strength development, or muscle hypertrophy.\n\n10\n\nOverall, the interference effect originally documented by Dr. Hickson does not appear to show up in long-term training outcome studies. That being said, to maximize fitness adaptations and to ensure that the total workload of a program is both achievable and does exceed recovery capacity some care should be taken.\n\n## Concurrent Training in Practice: Lessons from Hybrid Athletes (CrossFit, Hyrox)\n\nDespite evidence demonstrating the lack of interference effect in long term training studies, critics of concurrent training will often state that it will limit your ability to have elite level performances. For example, you will never get as muscular or as strong as possible if you are also trying to improve aerobic capacity.\n\nLet\u2019s use a CrossFit Games competitor as an example of a \u201chybrid athlete\u201d who does concurrent training at a high level. The 2025 CrossFit games included a 1RM back squat test among 9 other CrossFit workouts over 3 days. The top athlete for the male competitors squatted an impressive 256 kg or 565 pounds and the top female competitor squatted 174 kg or 385 pounds. Many average gym-goers and even some advanced lifters would be envious of these performances.\n\nThese are pretty impressive efforts on their own and even more so given that the performance was smack dab in the middle of 9 other workouts that demanded high levels of conditioning and gymnastics skills.\n\nWhile, yes, these athletes are the top of the sport and most people engaging in CrossFit workouts will not experience this level of performance \u2013 their results show that getting strong, building muscle, and improving aerobic capacity are possible concurrently.\n\nBut \u2013 could they be stronger if they only trained for strength? Or more muscular if they only trained for hypertrophy?\n\nAre these elite CrossFit athletes as absolutely strong as someone their size who trains and competes strictly as an elite level powerlifter? No.\n\nDo these CrossFit athletes have the aerobic capacity of world-class marathon runners? Also, no.\n\nBut their performance limitations may not lie in the fact that they are training for several different outcomes at once. The differences in these performances across the different sports likely represents a combination of genetics, time dedicated to achieving one single training outcome, sport selection, and other factors that make freak athletes freak athletes.\n\nNeedless to say, the example of these elite CrossFit athletes and other similar athletes demonstrates how it is certainly possible to gain significant amounts of muscle, build significant amounts of strength, and develop great cardiovascular fitness concurrently.\n\nWhile CrossFit can be a viable way to meet the current Physical Activity Guidelines, not everyone wants to do CrossFit. Present company included. So here are a few practical ways to program resistance training for strength and hypertrophy along with conditioning to meet the current physical activity guidelines and work towards your goals.\n\n### Practical Concurrent Training Programming Considerations\n\nThe current exercise guidelines recommend performing both aerobic and resistance training.\n\n11 This is a reasonable recommendation for the general and athletic population alike. However there is some nuance here as to how the training is applied which can be described using three unique cases relating to training status and goals. Before describing these cases, a brief discussion on training status.\n\nWhile many folks in the health and fitness space use terms like elite, advanced, intermediate, or novice when describing fitness levels it is very challenging to actually categorize people this way. Broadly speaking, individuals can be classified as either trained or untrained (beginners). After that, categorization becomes really murky and subjective.\n\nFor example, it has been suggested that adaptation rate, or how fast someone gets stronger or gains muscle, etc., is a good indicator for training advancement. However, adaptation rates are dynamic in all phases of an individual\u2019s career, and each specific adaptation has a variable rate of advancement \u2013 strength vs hypertrophy. As best as we can tell, strength gain isn\u2019t linear. Rather, strength improvements look more like a staircase, where average strength performance stays about the same for a bit of time, then increases to the next average. On top of that, average strength performance varies within ~5% of a \u201cbaseline\u201d day-to-day, making small improvements (or reductions) in strength mostly \u201cnoise\u201d vs actual improvements.\n\nPeople do tend to gain more strength, size, and cardiorespiratory fitness earlier on in their training career as they\u2019re further away from their maximum potential. However, the adaptation rate itself is not static. Newer lifters may go through phases where they\u2019re unable to add weight to the bar or otherwise progressively load their training, and advanced lifters may hit a hot streak and be able to add weight each time they get under the barbell. Because adaptation rate varies in an unpredictable way, it\u2019s not helpful for indicating programming needs. Instead, looking at an individual\u2019s recent training history, their responsiveness to it, current goals, and training resources are more helpful than an arbitrary classification of \u201cintermediate\u201d or \u201cadvanced\u201d when it comes to programming. (For more on how-to design and periodize a program, see our 100+ page eBook)\n\nDespite the obvious limitations in any classification system used beyond trained and untrained, these terms do come with a base level of understanding of someone\u2019s training history and fitness level, so we will use some of those terms below.\n\n### Case #1: The Untrained Beginner\n\nWe would recommend that all untrained beginners engage in concurrent training to meet or exceed the current physical activity guidelines. Existing evidence regarding the interference effect supports this recommendation. Gains in strength, hypertrophy, and muscular power are unlikely to be compromised by adding conditioning to the program as compared to a lifting-only program in this population. This individual engaging in both strength training and conditioning would maximize their health and fitness improvements as there are unique adaptations and benefits to both forms of exercise.\n\nFor best results:\n\n- When performing conditioning and resistance training on the same day, conditioning should be performed after resistance training at a moderate intensity, ~ 60-80% max heart rate.\n\n- Ideally, at least 150-minutes of moderate intensity conditioning would be performed weekly, with the volume split as many days as the individual\u2019s preferences, goals, and schedule allows\n\n### Case #2: The Competitor\n\nFor barbell sport competitors like powerlifters or Olympic weightlifters who are preparing for a meet or strength test, we recommend reducing conditioning volume during the last 4-6 weeks of preparation. Reducing conditioning volume frees up additional training and recovery resources that can be allocated to resistance training, which is the primary goal.\n\nFor example, a powerlifter getting ready for a meet who is doing 200-minutes per week of conditioning may reduce their conditioning volume as seen below:\n\n|Weeks Before Competition|Conditioning Volume|Intensity|\n|--|--|--|\n|5 Weeks Out|200 minutes/week (Normal Level)|Moderate Intensity|\n|4 Weeks Out|140 minutes/week|Moderate Intensity|\n|3 Weeks Out|100 minutes/week|Moderate Intensity|\n|2 Weeks Out|60 minutes/week|Moderate Intensity|\n|1 Week Out|30 minutes/week|Moderate Intensity|\nThis table clearly illustrates the recommended gradual reduction in conditioning volume (taper) for a strength athlete leading up to a competition.\n\nMaking weight, if applicable, would ideally be accomplished ahead of time via dietary interventions and not from excessive sweating and water loss from high levels of conditioning.\n\n### Case #3 \u2013 The Intermediate\n\nFor \u201cintermediates\u201d who are strength-focused, there may be some reticence to adding conditioning to their training at a volume consistent with the current guidelines. These individuals may be at or near their maximum tolerable training load, where adding additional exercise\n\n*could* compromise recovery and subsequent performance. In this case, we recommend a more gradual addition of conditioning in order to minimize any apparent interference effect, even if transient but also maximize fitness and health benefit.\n\nThis case describes many lifters who likely double the minimum recommendation of 2 days/week of strength training but don\u2019t perform any conditioning. For this individual, we recommend the following progression that builds up to the minimum recommendation of 150 minutes/week of moderate intensity conditioning volume:\n\n|Training Period|Conditioning Type & Intensity|Total Volume (Minutes/Week)|\n|--|--|--|\n|Weeks 1 & 2|Zone 1/Zone 2 Conditioning (2x/week)|60 minutes|\n|Weeks 3 & 4|Zone 1/Zone 2 Conditioning (3x/week)|90 minutes|\n|Weeks 5 & 6|Zone 2 Conditioning (3x/week) AND Zone 1 Conditioning (60 min, 1x/week)|150 minutes|\n|Note:|Focus on non-running or swimming activities initially to minimize musculoskeletal fatigue.|\nThis progression allows the individual to gradually build up to the minimum recommended\n\n**150 minutes/week** of moderate-intensity conditioning to maximize health benefits while minimizing the risk of an **interference effect** due to excessive fatigue.\n\nIt is important to note that we don\u2019t have anything against running or swimming. Context is important however, as this specific example is a \u201cstrength-focused\u201d individual who has not previously been doing a significant amount of conditioning work. Both running and swimming seem to produce a bit more fatigue than other options like cycling, erging, and elliptical-ing, though this is mostly based on experience, not scientific evidence.\n\nWant to know more about conditioning zones, heart rates, and more information regarding conditioning intensity? See here.\n\n## Does the Type of Conditioning Matter?\n\nNot every cardio modality is created equally, and they may stress your body in different ways. Swimming, cycling, rowing, and running can be used to achieve your conditioning goals but may fit into your resistance training differently.\n\nOne review on the topic found that while the interference effect was small and possibly isolated to Type I fibers that experience less hypertrophy compared to Type II fibers, the effect was more pronounced with running programs as compared to cycling programs.\n\n12\n\nOther studies, however, came to the opposite conclusion. They found that cycling had a larger negative effect than running with lower body exercise performance and muscle gain.\n\n14\n\nThe evidence doesn\u2019t provide any strong indication to choose one cardio modality over another. We would encourage folks to choose a conditioning modality that aligns with your goals, preferences, and equipment access while paying mind to the overall training load as too large of a dose of conditioning could interfere due to accumulating levels of fatigue.\n\n## Wrap-Up\n\nThe interference effect is defined as reduced strength, size, and/or power gains when doing both aerobic and resistance training as compared to a lifting-only program. While many potential mechanisms have been suggested, the existing evidence suggests that any apparent interference effect is transient, likely being related to an over-zealous training load.\n\nA good training program to support health and fitness will include both conditioning and strength training elements, though the proportion of each as part of the total training load will vary over time based on individual factors. For more strength-focused individuals, the bulk of the training load will be allocated to resistance training, with just enough left over to do conditioning that meets the current guidelines. For endurance-focused individuals, the bulk of the training load will be allocated to conditioning, with a smaller proportion achieved from lifting in order to support musculoskeletal function and reduce injury risk. For non-specialized individuals, the distribution of training load is mostly personal preference, though it should include both conditioning and resistance training.\n\n## References\n\n- Hickson R.

          "snippet": "## From science to practice\n\nThe effectiveness of the Norwegian 4\u00d74 method has been well researched and described in the literature. The actual study that demonstrated the effectiveness of this method was published in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise in 2007. In this study, forty healthy, moderately trained men were randomly assigned to four different training groups, demonstrating this mode of exercise was more effective than performing the same total amount of work at lactate threshold or at 70% of maximum heart rate for improving VO2max.\n\n\u2026\n\nResearch by this Helgerud and his colleagues shows that athletes following the 4\u00d74 protocol saw their VO\u2082max increase by 11% on average in just eight weeks. In addition, you can improve your maximal oxygen uptake per workout by about half a percent. This means that your heart muscle becomes stronger, allowing it to pump more blood and thus oxygen around the body per beat.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Superior results compared to other methods\n\nResearch shows that you get better results with this form of training (interval) than with traditional endurance training. With more long-term cardio, your body easily gets used to the load, causing you to plateau after a while. The Norwegian 4\u00d74 protocol is basically a form of HIIT(high-intensity interval training), but is distinguished by the longer four-minute intervals. This duration is exactly why the results are so good. Long enough to call on your VO2max, but short enough to recover from this in between and sustain it several times in a row.",

Testing and Benchmarking\n\n---\n\n## 1. Key Figures and Their Frameworks\n\n### 1.1 Chris Hinshaw \u2014 Aerobic Capacity and the Endurance Engine\n\nChris Hinshaw is the founder of the Aerobic Capacity programming system and has coached over 35 CrossFit Games champions. A former Ironman triathlete himself, Hinshaw transitioned into coaching functional fitness athletes after observing a critical gap: most high-intensity training programs neglected the aerobic system entirely, relying almost exclusively on glycolytic and phosphagen energy systems. Hinshaw's central thesis \u2014 which he calls \"building the engine\" \u2014 is that an athlete's aerobic base is the mechanical foundation that allows all other physical capacities to express themselves at higher volumes and for longer durations.\n\n**Core Philosophy: The Aerobic Engine**\n\nHinshaw's philosophy rests on several key principles drawn from his coaching experience and endurance sport background (Source: *PMPC Podcast #004, Chris Hinshaw \u2013 Aerobic Capacity Founder*, 2024; *Best Hour of Their Day* episodes 561-562; *Jedburgh Podcast*):\n\n1. **Fast-twitch fibers create fatigue; slow-twitch fibers clear it.** During high-intensity work, fast-twitch muscle fibers produce lactate and other fatigue-inducing byproducts. Slow-twitch fibers consume that lactate as fuel. If an athlete only trains high intensity, they become excellent at *producing* lactate and working under its burden, but they never develop the capacity to *clear* it. This is the bottleneck \u2014 and the aerobic engine is the solution.\n\n2. **If you have a 50/50 blend of fast-twitch and slow-twitch fibers and only train fast-twitch, you are leaving 50% of your available capacity passive.** Slow-twitch fibers require volume and time under tension to adapt. Short, explosive training sessions do not provide the overload stimulus these fibers need. This is especially critical for Hyrox, where the race lasts 60\u201390+ minutes and demands sustained output across diverse movement patterns.\n\n3. **Every movement is unique, and every intensity within that movement is unique.** Hinshaw insists that athletes train across a \"variety of intensities.\" Speed alone does not develop the full spectrum of the aerobic system. You must train the low end (base building, lactate clearance, capillarization), the moderate range (tempo and threshold work), and the high end (VO2max intervals) to build a complete engine.\n\n4. **Pacing is the ultimate competitive advantage.** Hinshaw was one of the earliest advocates of pacing strategy in functional fitness. He teaches that efficiently and effectively consuming available energy through controlled pacing maximizes total performance. In Hyrox, where athletes must sustain effort across 8 km of running interspersed with 8 functional stations, pacing is not optional \u2014 it is the difference between a competitive finish and a collapse.\n\n5. **Long-term cellular adaptation beats short-term intensity spikes.** While high-intensity protocols produce quick results, Hinshaw warns that these adaptations are \"non-sustainable\" and \"riddled with risk.\" The real gains come from cellular-level adaptation: increased mitochondrial density, capillarization, improved fat oxidation, and enhanced stroke volume. These take months to develop but last far longer and provide a far higher ceiling.\n\n**Hinshaw's Interval Prescriptions**\n\nHinshaw structures interval workouts around three key variables: **distance (or time), intensity, and rest**. He designs workouts with very specific intent \u2014 targeting either the aerobic system (VO2max zone, typically 6\u20139 minutes at maximum effort), the lactate clearance system (moderate work with active recovery), or the pacing system (controlled-split intervals). (Source: *Jedburgh Podcast*; *brUTE Strength Podcast Ep.10*)\n\n| Protocol Type | Example Workout | Work Interval | Rest Interval | Intensity | Target Adaptation |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| VO2max Intervals | 3 sets \u00d7 4 \u00d7 400m run | ~2 min per rep | 40 sec between reps, 4 min between sets | Moderate to hard pace | Aerobic capacity, oxygen utilization |\n| Multi-Modal Transfer | 4 \u00d7 2 min on each of bike, row, ski (12 rounds total) | 2 min per effort | Matched to running rest periods | Sport-specific moderate pace | Cross-modal aerobic transfer, RPM matching |\n| Pacing Intervals | 5 \u00d7 1 km run (even-split target) | ~4\u20136 min each | 2\u20133 min walk/jog | Controlled, aiming for identical splits | Pacing discipline, metabolic efficiency |\n| Active Recovery Focus | Wall balls: 20 reps + 5 slow air squats EMOM | ~45 sec work per min | Remaining time in minute (active) | Race-weight ball, race-pace reps | Lactate clearance under continued movement |\n| Aerobic Base Run | 30\u201360 min at conversational pace | Continuous | N/A | Zone 2 (nasal breathing capable) | Capillarization, fat oxidation, slow-twitch development |\n\n**Hinshaw's Active Recovery Principle for Hyrox:** Rather than lying on the floor between heavy sets, Hinshaw advocates keeping the body moving at low intensity \u2014 cycling slowly, doing air squats, or walking \u2014 to encourage the slow-twitch fibers to consume the lactate produced by the fast-twitch fibers. This is directly applicable to Hyrox station-to-run transitions, where the ability to recover *while still moving* is paramount. A Hyrox-adapted version: after sled pushes, immediately transition to a slow jog for the subsequent 1 km run rather than standing still, even if the first 200m feels slow. The physiological payoff is faster lactate clearance and a lower perceived effort for the remainder of the run. (Source: YouTube, \"Use Hinshaw's method to increase your reps for Hyrox,\" 2023)\n\n**Hyrox Relevance:** Hinshaw's framework maps almost perfectly onto the Hyrox demand profile. A Hyrox race is an 8 km run broken into 1 km segments, interspersed with 8 functional stations. More than 60% of total race time is spent running (Brandt et al., 2025, *Frontiers in Physiology*). The ability to clear lactate during running segments after high-output stations (sled push, sled pull, wall balls) is the single most trainable limiter for most recreational Hyrox athletes.\n\n---\n\n### 1.2 Andy Galpin, PhD \u2014 Exercise Physiology and the 9 Adaptations Framework\n\nAndy Galpin is a Professor of Kinesiology at California State University, Fullerton, and one of the foremost authorities on bridging exercise science and practical application. His six-part guest series on the *Huberman Lab Podcast* (January\u2013February 2023) constituted a landmark body of content on fitness science, covering everything from assessment to programming to recovery. His frameworks provide the scientific scaffolding upon which an AI Hyrox coach should build all training recommendations.\n\n**The 9 Exercise-Induced Adaptations**\n\nGalpin categorizes the physiological outcomes of exercise into 9 distinct adaptations. Each is elicited by manipulating modifiable training variables: exercise choice, intensity, volume, rest intervals, and progressive overload. The 9 adaptations are (Source: *Huberman Lab Guest Series*, Episode 1: \"How to Assess & Improve All Aspects of Your Fitness\"):\n\n| # | Adaptation | Definition | Key Training Variable | Hyrox Relevance |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | Skill/Technique | Moving more efficiently in specific patterns | Exercise choice, practice | Running economy, wall ball technique, sled mechanics |\n| 2 | Speed | Higher velocity or rate of acceleration | Low volume, max effort, full rest | Burpee broad jump explosiveness, sled push initiation |\n| 3 | Power | Speed \u00d7 Force | Explosive movements, moderate load | Sled push/pull drive, wall ball power |\n| 4 | Strength (Force) | Maximum force production in one effort | 3\u20135 reps, 3\u20135 sets, 3\u20135 min rest | Sled push/pull capacity, farmers carry load management |\n| 5 | Hypertrophy | Muscle size increase | 6\u201330 reps, 10\u201320 sets/muscle/week | Functional muscle mass for load-bearing stations |\n| 6 | Muscular Endurance | Reps to failure in a localized muscle group | High reps, short rest, local fatigue | Wall balls (75\u2013100 reps), sandbag lunges |\n| 7 | Anaerobic Capacity | Max work at max effort, total system fatigue | 20\u2013120 sec all-out, full recovery | Sled push/pull, ski erg, rowing erg bursts |\n| 8 | Maximal Aerobic Capacity (VO2max) | Max oxygen utilization, 8\u201315 min domain | Intervals at 85\u201395% HRmax, 3\u20135 min work | 1 km run splits, sustained high output across race |\n| 9 | Long-Duration Endurance | Sustained sub-maximal work, 15+ min, no breaks | Continuous effort, nasal breathing pace | Overall race endurance, pacing over 60\u201390 min |\n\n**Galpin's Key Principle for Hyrox Athletes:** The closer two adaptations are to each other on the list, the more compatible they are for concurrent training. Speed, power, and strength (2\u20134) are very complementary. Muscular endurance, anaerobic capacity, and aerobic capacity (6\u20138) are also compatible. The challenge arises when trying to maximize adaptations at opposite ends of the spectrum simultaneously \u2014 for example, maximal hypertrophy (5) and long-duration endurance (9). This is the concurrent training problem, which Galpin addresses directly. (Source: *Huberman Lab*, Episode 4: \"Optimize Your Training Program for Fitness & Longevity\")\n\n**Galpin's Programming Rules (The \"3-to-5\" Rule for Strength):**\n- 3\u20135 exercises per session\n- 3\u20135 reps per set\n- 3\u20135 sets per exercise\n- 3\u20135 times per week\n- 3\u20135 minutes rest between sets\n\nThis formula is for pure strength development. For Hyrox, Galpin would recommend a blended approach across the week \u2014 some sessions targeting strength (3\u20135 rule), others targeting muscular endurance (high rep, short rest), and others targeting aerobic capacity (Zone 2 or interval training).\n\n**Galpin's \"Sugarcane\" Protocol for Anaerobic Capacity**\n\nOne of the most practical tools Galpin shared on *Huberman Lab* (Episode 3: \"How to Build Physical Endurance & Lose Fat\") is the Sugarcane Protocol \u2014 a self-regulating interval workout designed to test and build anaerobic capacity:\n\n- **Round 1:** Choose a cardio modality (bike, rower, ski erg). Go as hard as you can for a set distance or time (e.g., 500m row). Note the time.\n- **Round 2:** Rest fully (2\u20134 minutes). Repeat the exact same distance. Try to match your Round 1 time. Note the time.\n- **Round 3:** Rest fully. Now you must *beat* your average time of Rounds 1 and 2.\n- **Progression:** Add rounds over weeks (3 \u2192 4 \u2192 5 \u2192 6\u20138 rounds).\n\nThe beauty of this protocol is self-regulation: if you go out too fast in Round 1, Round 3 becomes brutally hard. If you pace too conservatively, Round 3 is easy \u2014 but your total output suffers. It teaches pacing discipline while building anaerobic capacity \u2014 exactly the dual demand of Hyrox.\n\n**Galpin's Endurance Training Hierarchy:**\n\n| Endurance Type | Work Duration | Fuel Source | HR Zone | RPE | Breathing |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Muscular Endurance | Repeated reps to local failure | Glycogen, PCr | Variable | 6\u20138/10 | Unrestricted |\n| Anaerobic Capacity | 20\u2013120 sec max effort | Glycogen (anaerobic glycolysis) | Zone 4\u20135 | 9\u201310/10 | Mouth, forced |\n| Max Aerobic Capacity (VO2max) | 4\u20138 min intervals | Glycogen + Oxidative | Zone 4\u20135 | 8\u20139/10 | Mouth, labored |\n| Long-Duration Endurance | 15\u201360+ min continuous | Fat (primary), Glycogen (secondary) | Zone 2 | 4\u20136/10 | Nasal only (ideally) |\n\n(Source: *Huberman Lab*, Episode 3; *Momentous/Galpin* 9 Adaptations guide)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Energy Systems for Hyrox\n\n### 2.1 The Three Energy Systems: How They Interact During a 60\u201390 Minute Race\n\nAll three energy systems \u2014 phosphagen (ATP-PCr), glycolytic, and oxidative \u2014 operate simultaneously during any physical activity. What changes is their *relative contribution* based on intensity and duration. In Hyrox, the oxidative system is the dominant provider of ATP across the full race duration, but the glycolytic and phosphagen systems play crucial roles at specific stations and transitions.\n\n**The Brandt et al. (2025) Study \u2014 First Peer-Reviewed Hyrox Research**\n\nThis landmark study (Brandt, Ebel, Lebahn, & Schmidt, 2025; *Frontiers in Physiology*, 16, doi: 10.3389/fphys.2025.1519240) provides the most rigorous physiological data on Hyrox to date. Key findings from 11 recreational Hyrox athletes completing a simulated competition:\n\n| Metric | Full Hyrox | Running Segments | Exercise Stations |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Completion Time (median) | 86.5 min | 51.2 min (59%) | 32.8 min (38%) |\n| HR max (bpm) | 185 | 180 | 185 |\n| HR avg (bpm) | 170.9 | 168.9 | 173.7 |\n| Blood Lactate max (mmol/L) | 8.5 | 7.7 | 8.5 |\n| RPE max (Borg 6\u201320) | 18 | 16 | 18 |\n| Time at \"Very Hard\" intensity (% HRmax) | 79.5% of race | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n\n**Key Takeaways for Coaching:**\n- Hyrox is performed overwhelmingly at **hard to very hard intensity** (79.5% of total time above 80% HRmax).\n- **VO2max was the strongest correlate of overall race time** (\u03c1 = \u22120.71, p = 0.01), followed by endurance training volume (\u03c1 = \u22120.68) and body fat percentage (\u03c1 = 0.67).\n- **Strength measures (hand grip strength, muscle mass) did NOT correlate with completion time.** Once athletes can handle the competition loads, further strength gains yield diminishing returns.\n- The **exercise stations were more intense than the runs** by every metric (HR, lactate, RPE), but took less time.\n- The **heaviest stations (sled push, sled pull) were completed fastest** \u2014 typically 2\u20133 minutes \u2014 placing them in the glycolytic/anaerobic capacity domain.\n- **Wall balls produced the highest HR, lactate, and RPE** \u2014 occurring last in the race when cumulative fatigue is maximal.\n\n### 2.2 Energy System Demands by Hyrox Station\n\n| Station | Primary Energy System | Duration (typical) | Key Demand | Training Implication |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 km Run (\u00d78) | Oxidative (primary), Glycolytic (secondary) | 4\u20137 min each | Sustained aerobic output, lactate clearance between stations | Zone 2 base, threshold running, fatigued-state running |\n| Ski Erg (1000m) | Oxidative + Glycolytic | 3\u20135 min | Upper body aerobic endurance, sustained power | Aerobic intervals on ski erg, muscular endurance |\n| Sled Push (4\u00d712.5m) | Phosphagen + Glycolytic | 2\u20133 min | Maximal force production, rapid depletion | Strength-endurance, heavy sled practice, power endurance |\n| Sled Pull (4\u00d712.5m) | Phosphagen + Glycolytic | 2\u20133 min | Grip + posterior chain under heavy load | Grip endurance, rowing/pulling strength-endurance |\n| Burpee Broad Jump (80m) | Glycolytic + Oxidative | 3\u20135 min | Repeated explosive effort, global fatigue | Plyometric endurance, pacing short explosive reps |\n| Row Erg (1000m) | Oxidative + Glycolytic | 3\u20135 min | Full-body aerobic power, pacing | Aerobic intervals on rower, threshold pacing |\n| Farmers Carry (200m) | Oxidative (low intensity per step) | 2\u20133 min | Grip endurance, loaded locomotion | Loaded carries, grip training, trunk stability |\n| Sandbag Lunges (100m) | Glycolytic + Oxidative | 3\u20135 min | Muscular endurance (quads, glutes), balance | High-rep lunging, leg endurance, unilateral strength |\n| Wall Balls (75\u2013100 reps) | Glycolytic (dominant by end) | 3\u20136 min | Muscular endurance (quads, shoulders), lactate tolerance | High-rep wall balls, EMOM sets, active recovery between sets |\n\n(Sources: Brandt et al., 2025; Warrior Performance Lab analysis, 2025; HYROX Training Plans programming guide)\n\n### 2.3 How to Train Each Energy System for Hyrox\n\n| Energy System | Training Protocol | Work:Rest Ratio | Sets \u00d7 Duration | Intensity | Frequency/Week |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Phosphagen (ATP-PCr) | Heavy sled pushes, max sprints | 1:12\u20131:20 | 6\u201310 \u00d7 5\u201310 sec | 95\u2013100% max effort | 1\u20132\u00d7 (in strength sessions) |\n| Glycolytic (Fast) | Sled push/pull repeats, ski erg intervals | 1:3\u20131:5 | 4\u20138 \u00d7 30\u201390 sec | 85\u201395% max effort | 1\u20132\u00d7 |\n| Glycolytic (Slow) | Wall ball EMOMs, sandbag lunge sets, threshold intervals | 1:1\u20131:2 | 3\u20136 \u00d7 2\u20135 min | 75\u201385% max effort | 2\u20133\u00d7 |\n| Oxidative (VO2max) | Norwegian 4\u00d74, Hinshaw-style intervals | 1:0.75 | 4 \u00d7 4 min | 85\u201395% HRmax | 1\u20132\u00d7 |\n| Oxidative (Base/Zone 2) | Easy run, bike, row, hike | Continuous | 1 \u00d7 30\u201390 min | 60\u201370% HRmax, nasal breathing | 2\u20134\u00d7 |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Aerobic Base Development\n\n### 3.1 Zone 2 Training: What It Is, Why It Matters, How Much Is Enough\n\nZone 2 training refers to exercise performed at or just below the first lactate threshold (LT1), typically defined as the intensity at which blood lactate first rises above resting levels (~2 mmol/L). At this intensity, the body predominantly uses fat as fuel, the effort is sustainable for long durations, and the athlete can breathe through the nose or hold a conversation. (Source: I\u00f1igo San-Mill\u00e1n, PhD; CTS/TrainRight, 2025)\n\n**Physiological Adaptations of Zone 2 Training:**\n\n| Adaptation | Mechanism | Why It Matters for Hyrox |\n|---|---|---|\n| Increased mitochondrial density | Biogenesis of mitochondria in slow-twitch fibers | More energy production capacity per muscle cell |\n| Enhanced fat oxidation | Upregulation of fatty acid transport and beta-oxidation enzymes | Preserves glycogen for high-intensity stations |\n| Improved lactate clearance | Increased MCT1 transporters, slow-twitch fiber lactate shuttling | Faster recovery between stations and runs |\n| Increased capillarization | Growth of new capillary beds around muscle fibers | Better oxygen delivery and waste removal |\n| Greater stroke volume | Heart adapts to pump more blood per beat | Lower heart rate at any given submaximal pace |\n| Increased plasma volume | Expansion of blood volume | Better thermoregulation, improved cardiac output |\n\n**Zone 2 Intensity Guidelines:**\n\n| Method | Zone 2 Range | Practical Cue |\n|---|---|---|\n| % of Max Heart Rate | 60\u201370% HRmax | Can hold a conversation, slight breathlessness |\n| % of Lactate Threshold HR | 68\u201383% of LT2 HR | Comfortably challenging, not hard |\n| RPE (1\u201310) | 3\u20135/10 | \"I could do this for a long time\" |\n| Blood Lactate | 1.5\u20132.5 mmol/L | Below first lactate threshold |\n| Talk Test | Can speak in full sentences | Lose the ability = too hard |\n| Breathing | Nasal breathing achievable | If you must mouth-breathe, slow down |\n\n(Sources: San-Mill\u00e1n & Brooks, 2018; CTS/TrainRight \"Blood Lactate in Training\" article; Galpin, *Huberman Lab* Episode 3)\n\n**How Much Zone 2 Is Enough?**\n\nThe polarized training model used by elite endurance athletes suggests approximately 80% of total training volume should be in Zone 1\u20132, with the remaining 20% at high intensity (Zone 4\u20135). For a Hyrox athlete training 6\u201310 hours per week:\n\n| Weekly Training Volume | Zone 2 Target | Zone 2 Sessions | Format |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 6 hours/week | 3\u20134 hours | 2\u20133 sessions of 60\u201390 min | Easy runs, bike rides, row, hike |\n| 8 hours/week | 4\u20135 hours | 3\u20134 sessions of 60\u201380 min | Mixed modality (run, bike, row) |\n| 10 hours/week | 6\u20137 hours | 4\u20135 sessions of 60\u201390 min | Primarily running + cross-training |\n\nGalpin's recommendation for long-duration endurance: perform 15+ minutes of continuous work at a pace where you can maintain nasal breathing. For most Hyrox athletes, this is a run, bike, or row at an easy, conversational effort. Two sessions per week is the minimum effective dose; three to four is optimal for building a robust aerobic base while leaving room for high-intensity and strength work. (Source: *Huberman Lab*, Episode 3)\n\n### 3.2 The MAF (Maximum Aerobic Function) Method\n\nThe MAF method, developed by Dr. Phil Maffetone, uses a simple formula to estimate Zone 2 heart rate: **180 \u2212 age = MAF HR ceiling**. This is then adjusted by fitness status (e.g., +5 for consistent athletes, \u22125 for recovering from injury/illness).\n\n| Age | MAF HR (Base) | Adjusted (Fit Athlete) | Adjusted (Returning from Injury) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 25 | 155 bpm | 160 bpm | 150 bpm |\n| 30 | 150 bpm | 155 bpm | 145 bpm |\n| 35 | 145 bpm | 150 bpm | 140 bpm |\n| 40 | 140 bpm | 145 bpm | 135 bpm |\n\n**Hyrox Application:** The MAF method is useful as a *starting point* for Hyrox athletes who don't have access to lactate testing. However, it is less accurate than lactate-based zone setting, and athletes with high fitness levels may find it overly conservative. Use MAF as a floor \u2014 if your easy runs feel \"too slow\" at MAF heart rate, that's actually the point. Trust the process. Over 8\u201312 weeks, MAF pace will improve (same heart rate, faster pace), which is direct evidence of aerobic base improvement.\n\n### 3.3 Lactate Threshold Training for Hyrox Pacing\n\nThe lactate threshold (LT2) represents the intensity above which lactate accumulates faster than the body can clear it. For Hyrox, the goal is to push LT2 as high as possible so that race pace (which is predominantly aerobic) represents a smaller fraction of maximal capacity.\n\n**Lactate Threshold Interval Protocols:**\n\n| Protocol | Work Interval | Rest | Sets | Intensity | Target |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Tempo Runs | 20\u201340 min continuous | N/A | 1 | ~85\u201388% HRmax, \"comfortably hard\" | LT2 improvement |\n| Cruise Intervals | 3 \u00d7 10\u201315 min | 2\u20133 min jog | 3 | At or slightly below LT2 | Sustained threshold capacity |\n| Threshold Repeats | 4 \u00d7 8 min | 2\u20133 min | 4 | At LT2 pace | Lactate tolerance and clearance |\n| Progressive Run | 30\u201345 min, last 10\u201315 min at threshold | N/A | 1 | Build from Zone 2 \u2192 LT2 | Pacing discipline, metabolic transition |\n\n(Sources: Kristensen et al., as cited in *PMC* zone 2/3 interval review, 2023; Helgerud et al., 2007)\n\n**Hyrox-Specific Application:** A Hyrox race is best paced at or just below lactate threshold for the running segments. The stations will push blood lactate above threshold. The runs must therefore be paced conservatively enough to allow partial lactate clearance. Training at threshold teaches the body where that \"redline\" is and expands it over time. A weekly schedule might include one tempo or threshold session and one true Zone 2 session as the endurance components alongside interval and strength work.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Interval Training Science\n\n### 4.1 Interval Protocol Comparison Table\n\n| Protocol | Work Duration | Rest Duration | Intensity | Sets/Reps | Primary Adaptation | Key Study |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **Norwegian 4\u00d74** | 4 min | 3 min active recovery | 85\u201395% HRmax | 4 intervals | VO2max (+11\u201313% in 8 weeks) | Helgerud et al., 2007 |\n| **Tabata** | 20 sec | 10 sec | All-out (170% VO2max) | 8 rounds (4 min total) | Anaerobic capacity, VO2max | Tabata et al., 1996 |\n| **30/30 Intervals** | 30 sec | 30 sec active | 90\u2013100% vVO2max | 12\u201320 rounds | Time at VO2max, buffering | Billat et al., 2001 |\n| **Long Intervals** | 3\u20135 min | 2\u20134 min | 90\u201395% HRmax | 4\u20136 sets | VO2max, cardiac output | Seiler & Sjursen, 2004 |\n| **Short Intervals** | 10\u201330 sec | 20\u201360 sec | Maximal sprint | 6\u201310 sets | Phosphagen repletion, speed | Ross & Leveritt, 2001 |\n| **Threshold Repeats** | 8\u201315 min | 2\u20133 min | LT2 pace | 3\u20134 sets | Lactate threshold elevation | \u2014 |\n| **Hinshaw Multi-Modal** | 2 min per modality | 40 sec between reps, 4 min between sets | Moderate\u2013hard | 3 sets \u00d7 4 reps | Cross-modal aerobic transfer | Hinshaw (practitioner) |\n| **Galpin Sugarcane** | Variable (set distance) | 2\u20134 min full recovery | Self-regulated (escalating) | 3\u20138 rounds | Anaerobic capacity, pacing | Galpin (practitioner) |\n\n### 4.2 The Norwegian 4\u00d74 Protocol \u2014 Gold Standard for VO2max\n\nThe Norwegian 4\u00d74 is arguably the most well-validated interval protocol for improving VO2max. Developed by researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the protocol is:\n\n- **Warm-up:** 10 minutes at easy pace\n- **Work:** 4 \u00d7 4 minutes at 85\u201395% of HRmax\n- **Recovery:** 3 minutes of active recovery (walking or easy jogging) between intervals\n- **Cool-down:** 5\u201310 minutes easy\n\n**Evidence:** Helgerud et al. (2007, *Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise*) demonstrated a 13% increase in VO2max in just 8 weeks with this protocol, compared to only 3.2% with steady-state training of equivalent total work. Wisl\u00f8ff et al. (2007) showed that 4\u00d74 intervals improved cardiac function and reversed heart damage in heart failure patients. A study of untrained 50-year-olds showed that performing the Norwegian 4\u00d74 just once per week for two years made their hearts functionally 20 years younger. (Sources: Science for Sport, 2025; Fysiofitaal analysis; Helgerud et al., 2007)\n\n**Why This Matters for Hyrox:** VO2max was the strongest single predictor of Hyrox race performance (Brandt et al., 2025). The 4-minute work intervals fall right in the 6\u20139 minute \"VO2max time domain\" that Hinshaw identifies as the sweet spot for improving the ability to bring in and utilize oxygen. One to two sessions per week of Norwegian 4\u00d74 intervals on the rower, bike, ski erg, or running track should be a staple for any Hyrox athlete in their general preparation phase.\n\n### 4.3 How to Periodize Intervals Leading into a Hyrox Race\n\n| Weeks Out from Race | Phase | Interval Focus | Example Session | Frequency |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 16\u201312 | Base Building | Zone 2 + short introduction to intervals | 1 \u00d7 Norwegian 4\u00d74 per week + 2\u20133 Zone 2 sessions | 1 interval + 2\u20133 Zone 2 |\n| 12\u20138 | Aerobic Development | VO2max intervals + threshold work | Norwegian 4\u00d74 (1\u00d7/wk) + threshold repeats (1\u00d7/wk) + Zone 2 (2\u00d7/wk) | 2 intervals + 2 Zone 2 |\n| 8\u20134 | Race-Specific | Hyrox simulation intervals, station-to-run transitions | Race-pace station work + 1 km runs (1\u00d7/wk) + 30/30 intervals (1\u00d7/wk) + Zone 2 (1\u20132\u00d7/wk) | 2 intervals + 1\u20132 Zone 2 |\n| 4\u20132 | Sharpening | Reduce volume, maintain intensity | Short sharp intervals (Tabata or 30/30) 1\u00d7/wk + 1 easy run + 1 race-pace session | 1\u20132 sessions, reduced volume |\n| 2\u20130 | Taper | Reduce volume 40\u201360%, maintain intensity | 1 short interval session + 1 easy run + rest | Minimal, quality over quantity |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Concurrent Training Research\n\n### 5.1 The Interference Effect: What the Science Actually Says\n\nThe \"interference effect\" was first documented by Hickson (1980), who showed that untrained men doing both strength and endurance training simultaneously had reduced strength gains compared to those doing strength training alone. This spawned decades of concern that \"cardio kills gains.\"\n\n**The Molecular Mechanism (Simplified):**\n\n- **Resistance training** activates the **mTOR pathway** (Mammalian Target of Rapamycin), which drives muscle protein synthesis \u2014 the process of building new muscle tissue.\n- **Endurance training** activates the **AMPK pathway** (AMP-activated protein kinase), which restores cellular energy balance by upregulating catabolic processes and inhibiting anabolic processes, including mTOR.\n- These two pathways were once thought to act as a molecular \"switch\" \u2014 you're either building muscle (mTOR) or generating energy (AMPK), but not both simultaneously.\n\n**What Modern Research Shows:**\n\nThree major meta-analyses have now concluded that **concurrent training does not significantly compromise strength or hypertrophy gains** compared to resistance-training-only programs, provided total training load is managed appropri",
