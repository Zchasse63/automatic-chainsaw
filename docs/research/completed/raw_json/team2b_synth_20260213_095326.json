Station-Specific Training Methods (All Elite Athletes)\n3. CrossFit-to-Hyrox Translation Guide\n\n---\n\n## 1. Rich Froning \u2014 CrossFit Legend Entering Hyrox\n\n### Background & Legacy\n\nRich Froning Jr. is the most decorated athlete in CrossFit history: 4x individual CrossFit Games champion (2011\u20132014) and 6x team champion with CrossFit Mayhem Freedom. He operates CrossFit Mayhem in Cookeville, Tennessee, runs the Mayhem Athlete online programming platform, and hosts *The Rich Froning Podcast*. His mantra\u2014\"Faith. Family. Fitness. Service.\"\u2014frames everything he does.\n\n### Hyrox Race Results & Times\n\n**Based on all available research data, there is no evidence that Rich Froning has competed in an official Hyrox race as of February 2026.** No Hyrox race results, finish times, or event registrations were found bearing his name. The search results consistently return \"Rich Ryan\" (an Elite 15 Hyrox athlete and host of the RMR Training Podcast) rather than \"Rich Froning.\"\n\nIt is critical for the knowledge base to distinguish between these two athletes:\n\n| Athlete | Sport | Notable Achievement |\n|---------|-------|-------------------|\n| **Rich Froning** | CrossFit | 4x Individual CrossFit Games Champion |\n| **Rich Ryan** | Hyrox | Elite 15 qualifier, Pro PR 54:28, Men's Pro Doubles WR holder (48:31 with Pelayo Menendez) |\n\n### Rich Froning's \"Going Hybrid\" Philosophy\n\nWhile Froning has not competed in Hyrox, his podcast episode **\"Going Hybrid & Doing Hard Things\" (Episode 069, January 14, 2026)** reveals his current training trajectory and mindset toward hybrid/endurance events:\n\n- **Iron Man Training**: Froning confirmed he has registered for an **Iron Man triathlon in Panama City, FL (November 7, 2026)**. He stated: *\"The reason I'm doing this is because it is so far out of my comfort zone of what I want to do or what I want to be, and I need to do that every once in a while.\"*\n- **Running Background**: He admitted he has never officially completed a marathon, though he once ran 26 miles in training approximately 15 years ago and abandoned marathon preparation because *\"I was getting really slow\u2026 I don't want to be that type of athlete.\"*\n- **21-Mile Trail Run**: He and a crew member ran approximately 21 miles on trails with zero training, zero sleep, and in 19\u00b0F weather\u2014demonstrating his raw endurance capacity.\n- **Training Plan for Iron Man**: He outlined his approach:\n  - Swim twice per week (~2,000m each session), ramping up with one longer open-water session\n  - Mountain bike through spring (Amarillo race prep), transitioning to road cycling by July/August\n  - One metcon per week with running intervals (5\u20138K)\n  - One long slow Sunday session\n  - Brick workouts (bike-to-run transitions)\n\n*(Source: The Rich Froning Podcast, Episode 069, CrossFit Mayhem YouTube, Jan 14, 2026)*\n\n### Training Philosophy: General Physical Preparedness (GPP)\n\nFroning's training philosophy is rooted in **GPP\u2014General Physical Preparedness**\u2014which aligns philosophically (though not specifically) with hybrid/Hyrox training:\n\n| Training Principle | Froning's Approach |\n|---|---|\n| **Daily Structure** | 3-hour AM session + 2-hour PM session (during competition season) |\n| **Weekly Template** | Mon: Squat / Tue: Press / Wed: Deadlift / Thu: Press / Fri: Squat; Cleans and snatches heavy 2x/week each |\n| **Programming Style** | \"By the seat of my pants\"\u2014adjusts daily based on feel, intuitive autoregulation |\n| **Conditioning Formats** | AMRAPs, EMOMs, For Time, Interval Training |\n| **Periodization** | Base Phase (GPP) \u2192 Power Phase (Olympic lifts, plyometrics) \u2192 Competition/Peaking Phase |\n| **Separation of Modalities** | Keeps strength and conditioning workouts separate; does not mix within a session |\n\n*(Sources: allthingsgym.com, hoylesfitness.com, WHOOP interview, Rich Froning Training Program analysis)*\n\n### Sample Training Days (Documented)\n\n**Day 1:**\n- 20 min AirDyne: 30s on / 30s off\n- Row 4,500m\n- 15 sets EMOM: 3 muscle-ups w/ 20lb vest\n- EMOM bench press + power clean ladder to 205lb (reached round 10)\n- 3 rounds: handstand walk, double-unders, strict pull-ups, air squats (1 min rest between)\n- Power cleans for 25 min: 3 every 30s at 225lb for 5 min\n\n**Day 2:**\n- 7 rounds: 7 deadlifts at 275lb + 14 push-ups\n- Partner workout: 100 cal Bike Erg / 1,400m Run / 100 cal Bike Erg / 1,400m Run\n- 3 rounds (rest 1:1): 3 rope climbs + 21 bench press / 2 rope climbs + 15 bench press / 1 rope climb + 9 bench press (155lb barbell, 30lb backpack rope climb)\n\n*(Source: YouTube \"Rich Froning Full Day of Training,\" allthingsgym.com)*\n\n### Key Insights for the Knowledge Base\n\n1. **Froning has NOT competed in Hyrox**\u2014any references to \"Rich\" in Hyrox contexts likely refer to Rich Ryan.\n2. **His GPP background would theoretically translate well** to Hyrox, but he has expressed more interest in Iron Man triathlon and mountain bike racing as his next competitive endeavors.\n3. **His training volume (5+ hours/day)** far exceeds what most Hyrox athletes do, but much of it is CrossFit-specific (Olympic lifting, gymnastics).\n4. **His self-awareness about running limitations** is instructive: *\"I would prefer to do something like Amarillo that sucks still but it's more power output, 30-40 minutes rest for an hour or two.\"*\n\n---\n\n## 2. Station-Specific Training Methods (All Elite Athletes)\n\n### 2.1 Sled Work (Push & Pull)\n\n#### Rich Ryan \u2014 The Sled Transformation Blueprint\n\nRich Ryan went from being \"scared of the sleds\" to posting the **fastest sled push time at the 2025 Hyrox World Championships**. His protocol is the most comprehensively documented:\n\n**Three Pillars of Sled Training:**\n\n| Pillar | Focus | Example Session |\n|--------|-------|-----------------|\n| **Strength** | Heavy load, short distance | Heavy sled \u00d7 3-4 sets of 25m, 4-6 min rest between |\n| **Speed** | Lighter load, fast turnover | Lighter sled \u00d7 50m unbroken, focus on foot speed |\n| **Lactate Tolerance** | Race-weight load, unbroken efforts | Race-weight sled \u00d7 37-50m unbroken at all costs, long rest (4-6 min), repeat |\n\n**Key Programming Details:**\n- **Frequency**: 2x per week (previously tried 4x/week, caused lower leg/foot pain)\n- **Progression**: Undulated (not linear)\u2014rotates between heavy/short, light/fast, and long/grindy\n- **Compromised Work**: One session includes sleds loaded at the FRONT of a compromised running workout (e.g., sled push \u2192 tempo run), not after long fatigue accumulation\n- **Concentric Advantage**: Sled work is almost entirely concentric (no eccentric loading), meaning faster recovery than squats/deadlifts\u2014a major advantage for frequent training\n\n*(Source: John Get Strong podcast interview with Rich Ryan, \"No One's Figured Hyrox Out Yet\")*\n\n#### Hunter McIntyre \u2014 EMOM Sled Protocol\n\nHunter's signature sled approach uses **time-based EMOM formats** rather than set/rep schemes:\n\n- **18-minute EMOM**: Alternating sled push and TRX rows, flowing continuously (no prescribed rest\u2014just maintain sustained lactate threshold effort)\n- **Sled weight in training**: 425lb (vs. 340lb race weight for men's pro), deliberately overloading\n- **Technique**: High-arm position, lean into sled like a rugby scrum, drive through legs\n- **Key principle**: *\"As soon as lactate starts to form\u2026 push a little further and stay there. Don't push so far that performance starts to drop. Sustained burning.\"*\n\n*(Source: Dan Churchill YouTube, \"HYROX Training with 3X World Champion Hunter McIntyre in NYC\")*\n\n#### Jake Dearden \u2014 Structured Week-by-Week Sled Progression\n\nJake Dearden's published 3-week plan provides the most structured sled periodization:\n\n| Week | Sled Push | Sled Pull |\n|------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Week 1** | 3 \u00d7 25m @ Hyrox weight, 1 min rest | 3 \u00d7 25m @ Hyrox weight, 1 min rest |\n| **Week 2** | 3 rounds: 25m push + 500m run + 25m push, 90s rest | 3 rounds: 25m pull + 500m run + 25m pull, 90s rest |\n| **Week 3** | Full 50m sled push in 5-min window (race simulation) | Full 50m sled pull in 5-min window (race simulation) |\n\n*(Source: Tom's Guide / inkl.com, Jake Dearden 3-week Hyrox plan)*\n\n#### Jason Khalipa \u2014 CrossFitter's Sled Assessment\n\nKhalipa noted from his Pro Doubles experience (1:07:13 finish):\n- The sled was *\"surprisingly heavy\u2026 especially on the pull\"*\n- The **sled pull is the biggest skill** CrossFitters need to practice\u2014it's not a movement pattern familiar from CrossFit\n- His partner Gabe Yanez had to compensate on burpees because Khalipa took on more sled work\n\n*(Source: Hybrid Fitness Media podcast, \"Can HYROX and CrossFit Co-Exist?\")*\n\n#### Dan Churchill \u2014 Learning From Hunter\n\nDan Churchill trained under Hunter's guidance and noted:\n- Hunter's sled push cadence was significantly faster\n- Hunter's row stroke rate was ~52 RPM vs. Dan's low 40s, with more power per stroke\n- Key takeaway: *\"Get faster, stronger, and a better engine\"*\n\n*(Source: Dan Churchill YouTube, training session with Hunter McIntyre)*\n\n---\n\n### 2.2 SkiErg & Rowing\n\n#### Jake Dearden \u2014 SkiErg Interval Protocol\n\n**Week 1 SkiErg Session:**\n- 12 \u00d7 250m with 45 seconds rest\n- Goal: *\"Consistent across all 12 efforts at a tough but repeatable pace\"*\n- Scale to 8 rounds if accumulated volume is too high\n\n**Week 2 Integration:**\n- 3 rounds: 500m Ski Erg + 20m sled push @ Hyrox weight, 90s rest\n\n**Week 3 Race Simulation:**\n- 1,000m Ski Erg in a 5-minute window, rest remainder\n\n*(Source: Tom's Guide, Jake Dearden 3-week plan)*\n\n#### Rich Ryan \u2014 Threshold-Based Erg Training\n\nRich Ryan's erg approach is driven by his threshold training philosophy:\n- SkiErg and RowErg are integrated into **30-minute EMOM sequences** alternating stations every 5 minutes\n- Pacing calibrated via **5K erg test** as a threshold baseline\n- Key insight: *\"The SkiErg matters more than the RowErg on race day\"*\u2014because heart rate response differs by body position (seated rowing = lower HR due to horizontal leg positioning)\n- Common form mistakes addressed on the RMR podcast (damper settings, stroke rate optimization)\n\n*(Source: RMR Training Podcast, \"Erg Training for HYROX\" episode)*\n\n#### Hunter McIntyre \u2014 Row/Ski EMOM\n\n**14-Minute EMOM Protocol:**\n- 14-minute block on Ski Erg, higher intensity than the 18-min sled block\n- \"Shorter efforts, higher intensity\"\u2014fewer total reps, increased power per rep\n- Followed by **5 rounds of 20 cal row + 20 burpees in 2-minute windows**\n\n*(Source: Dan Churchill YouTube)*\n\n#### Jason Khalipa / Dan Churchill\n\nNo specific SkiErg or rowing protocols were documented for these athletes beyond general race observations. Khalipa acknowledged the erg machines were less of a concern for CrossFit athletes given their familiarity with the equipment.\n\n---\n\n### 2.3 Wall Balls\n\n#### Rich Ryan \u2014 The Definitive Wall Ball Strategy\n\nRich Ryan produced the most comprehensive wall ball guide in the Hyrox space:\n\n**Set/Rep Strategy:**\n- If capable of 50+ unbroken: do the big set first, then manage the remainder\n- If not: pick a sustainable number (25, 15, or even 5) and maintain consistent rest intervals throughout all 100 reps\n- *\"Stay just under your threshold for your high-end ability\"*\n\n**Breathing Protocol (Counter-Intuitive):**\n- **Exhale on release** (throwing the ball up)\n- **Inhale on catch/descent**\n- This flips the traditional Valsalva squat breathing pattern\u2014allows continuous breathing through the full ROM, improves O\u2082 intake, reduces ventilation rate spikes\n\n**Arm Recovery Technique:**\n- After throwing the ball, **drop arms down to sides or swing out** to promote blood flow to shoulders\n- Do NOT hold arms overhead waiting for the ball to return\n- Catch position: under the chin, not above the head\n\n**Cadence Training:**\n- Practice **fast descent** into the squat\u2014drop before the ball arrives\n- Build \"gears\"\u2014different speeds you can select during the race\n\n**Mental Visualization:**\n- Treats every 10 reps as 100m on a running track\n- At 60 reps: *\"I just have 40 left, which is like 400m. I will never stop in my last 400.\"*\n\n**Race Pacing Context:**\n- Wall balls are the LAST station\u2014treat the entire race as setup for a \"kick\" into wall balls\n- *\"Give back two minutes on the course of your effort so you can come into wall balls and gain two and a half\"*\n\n*(Source: Rich Ryan YouTube, \"Proven Wall Ball Strategies for HYROX\")*\n\n#### Jake Dearden \u2014 Volume Progression\n\n| Week | Wall Ball Protocol |\n|------|-------------------|\n| **Week 1** | 4 sets: 30 wall balls @ Hyrox weight in 3-min windows, max farmers carry in remaining time, 2 min rest |\n| **Week 2** | 3 rounds: 50 wall balls + 500m run + 50 wall balls, 90s rest \u00d7 3 |\n| **Week 3** | 100 wall balls in a 5-minute window (race simulation) |\n\n*(Source: Tom's Guide, Jake Dearden 3-week plan)*\n\n#### Hunter McIntyre \u2014 Training Overload\n\nHunter uses **20lb wall balls in training** versus the 14lb competition standard (men's pro uses 9kg/~20lb, open uses 6kg/~14lb), creating an overload effect:\n- 15 wall balls per minute in EMOM format combined with toes-to-bar\n- Emphasis on not \"slogging through slow repetitions\" but taking **micro breaks, collecting yourself, then attacking again**\n\n*(Source: YouTube, \"HYROX Training: Conditioning\")*\n\n#### General Wall Ball Endurance Protocols (From Training Literature)\n\n| Protocol | Structure | Focus |\n|----------|-----------|-------|\n| **Pyramid** | 10-20-30-20-10 reps, 60s rest between | Variable rep schemes |\n| **EMOM** | 15 reps every minute \u00d7 10 min | Consistent output under time pressure |\n| **Tabata Plus** | 8 \u00d7 40s on / 20s off, then 2 min rest, repeat 2-3x | Power endurance |\n| **Race Simulation** | 100 for time with planned breaks every 20-25 reps | Race-day pacing |\n\n*(Source: hyroxtrainingplans.com)*\n\n---\n\n### 2.4 Burpee Broad Jumps\n\n#### General Elite Protocols\n\nNo athlete in the research dataset provided a detailed, proprietary burpee broad jump training protocol. However, structured approaches from training literature include:\n\n**Technique Optimization:**\n- **Drop down**: Controlled fall (not slow descent)\n- **Push-up**: Chest to floor, explosive push-off\n- **Jump**: Arms back for momentum, triple extension, forward lean\n- **Landing**: Bent knees, controlled absorption, quick reset\n\n**Training Progressions:**\n\n| Phase | Protocol |\n|-------|----------|\n| **Week 1-2** | 5\u00d75 burpees + 5\u00d75 broad jumps separately; 3\u00d710 combined at comfortable pace |\n| **Week 3-4** | 4 rounds: 10 BBJ + 90s rest; 3\u00d72 min continuous BBJ |\n| **Race-Specific** | Distance pyramids: 20m\u219240m\u219260m\u219280m\u219260m\u219240m\u219220m, 60-90s rest |\n| **Sprint Intervals** | 8 \u00d7 20m BBJ at high intensity, 45s rest |\n\n**Pacing Strategy:**\n- Start at 70-80% maximum intensity\n- Focus on rhythm and consistent jump distance\n- Build intensity in final 20-30% of distance\n\n*(Source: hyroxtrainingplans.com)*\n\n#### Jason Khalipa \u2014 Race Lesson\n\nGabe Yanez (Khalipa's doubles partner) went too hard on burpees to compensate for sled fatigue, then paid for it on the subsequent run: *\"I did so many burpees and so fast that we came out of that run and I thought our race was over\u2026 Jason was actually pulling away from me in the run.\"* The takeaway: going 10-15 seconds faster on a station costs 2+ minutes on the subsequent run.\n\n*(Source: Hybrid Fitness Media podcast)*\n\n---\n\n### 2.5 Farmers Carry & Sandbag Lunges\n\n#### Jake Dearden \u2014 Integrated Carry Training\n\n- **Week 1**: 4 sets of 30 wall balls in 3-min windows, then max distance farmers carry @ Hyrox weight in remaining time (2 min rest)\n- **Week 2**: Walking lunges: 3 \u00d7 50m @ 1.5\u00d7 Hyrox weight, 2 min rest (overloaded)\n- **Week 3**: Full 200m farmers carry and 100m walking lunge in 5-minute windows\n\n*(Source: Tom's Guide, Jake Dearden 3-week plan)*\n\n#### Rich Ryan \u2014 Lunge Pain Management\n\nRich Ryan has acknowledged lunges as his biggest pain point, particularly knee-related discomfort. His approach:\n- Extended warm-ups before lunge-heavy sessions\n- Knees Over Toes Guy (Ben Patrick) programming for joint resilience\n- Work with movement specialist Lawrence Van Lingen in Boulder, CO\n- Open-minded exploration of non-traditional rehab/prehab methods\n\n*(Source: John Get Strong podcast interview)*\n\n#### Hunter McIntyre & Others\n\nNo detailed farmers carry or sandbag lunge protocols were documented for Hunter McIntyre, Jason Khalipa, or Dan Churchill beyond general race execution observations. Hunter's Men's Health profile confirms the standard distances (200m farmers carry, 100m sandbag lunges) but no specific training protocols were published.\n\n---\n\n## 3. CrossFit-to-Hyrox Translation Guide\n\n### 3.1 What CrossFit Skills Transfer Directly\n\nBased on insights from Jason Khalipa, Rich Ryan, and Gabe Yanez:\n\n| CrossFit Skill | Hyrox Transfer |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| **Wall balls** | Direct transfer\u2014identical movement (though rep count is higher: 100 in Hyrox) |\n| **Sled push** | Partial transfer\u2014CrossFit athletes familiar with sled but rarely at Hyrox distances |\n| **SkiErg / RowErg** | Direct transfer\u2014standard CrossFit equipment |\n| **Burpees** | Partial transfer\u2014Hyrox adds broad jump component |\n| **Mental toughness** | Strong transfer\u2014*\"Doing hard s*** together\"* is CrossFit's DNA |\n| **Work capacity** | Strong transfer\u2014CrossFitters can sustain high output |\n| **Strength base** | Strong transfer\u2014generally overqualified for Hyrox loads |\n\n### 3.2 Gaps a Typical CrossFit Athlete Has\n\n| Gap | Why It Matters |\n|-----|---------------|\n| **Running volume & aerobic base** | Hyrox involves 8km of running; CrossFit rarely programs runs >1 mile. Khalipa: *\"It's a lot of running.\"* |\n| **Pacing discipline** | CrossFit rewards going all-out; Hyrox punishes it. *\"You're gonna pay two minutes on the run if you bake yourself on the stations.\"* (Gabe Yanez) |\n| **Sled pull technique** | Not a standard CrossFit movement. Khalipa identified this as the biggest skill gap. |\n| **Sustained threshold effort** | CrossFit metcons are 8-20 min; Hyrox races are 55-75+ min. Rich Ryan: *\"I was a middle-distance athlete\u2026 races between 4 and 15 minutes. Moving into a 60+ minute race is a different style of training.\"* |\n| **Transition management** | Running \u2192 immediate station work under high HR is a specific skill. *\"Transitions are where races are won or lost.\"* |\n\n### 3.3 Training Modification Framework\n\n**Phase 1: Base Building (Weeks 1-8)**\n- Add 3-4 runs per week (2 easy, 1 tempo, 1 interval)\n- Build running volume to 25-35km/week\n- Introduce sled pull technique work 2x/week\n- Maintain 1-2 strength sessions (reduce Olympic lifting volume)\n\n**Phase 2: Hyrox-Specific (Weeks 9-16)**\n- 2x threshold sessions per week (40-55 min at low Zone 4)\n- 2x station-specific training (sled circuits, wall ball volume, erg intervals)\n- 1x compromised running workout (run + station combos)\n- 1x long easy run (10-15km)\n- Reduce CrossFit metcons to 1x/week\n\n**Phase 3: Race Peak (Weeks 17-20)**\n- Race simulations (partial or full)\n- Taper volume 20% in final 2 weeks\n- Focus on pacing, transitions, and nutrition strategy\n\n### 3.4 Common Mistakes CrossFit Athletes Make in First Hyrox\n\n| Mistake | Consequence | Fix |\n|---------|-------------|-----|\n| **Going out too fast** | Blow up by station 5-6; walk the final runs | Start 10-15s/km slower than threshold pace |\n| **Sprinting the sleds** | Legs destroyed for remaining 4-5 runs | Short powerful pushes with quick resets; avoid sprinting |\n| **Ignoring running training** | Stations feel manageable but total time balloons | Running is ~45% of total race time; train it proportionally |\n| **No transition practice** | 10-20 seconds wasted per transition (80-160s total) | Practice run\u2192station combos weekly: 800m run \u2192 sled push \u2192 400m run |\n| **Treating it like a metcon** | Unsustainable intensity; catastrophic fade | Hyrox is an endurance event with strength elements, not vice versa |\n| **Over-relying on strength** | Wasted energy on stations that don't benefit from maximal effort | Efficiency > intensity on stations; save energy for consistent running |\n| **Skipping SkiErg/Row practice** | Poor technique costs 60-90s per station | A skilled rower: ~4:00 for 1,000m; beginner with bad form: ~5:30 |\n\n*(Sources: hyroxdatalab.com, Hybrid Fitness Media podcast, RMR Training Podcast, hyroxtrainingplans.com)*\n\n### 3.5 Key Quotes for the Knowledge Base\n\n> **Jason Khalipa**: *\"If you come from a CrossFit background, you're not gonna have a problem with any of this stuff\u2026 the sled's not that heavy. It's the running. It's a lot of running.\"*\n\n> **Gabe Yanez**: *\"If you're a CrossFitter going into it, the stations are not going to be a problem for you\u2014make sure you're pacing the running.\"*\n\n> **Rich Ryan**: *\"If you take a triathlete straight off a triathlon and a CrossFit athlete straight off a competition and make them do a Hyrox, the CrossFitter's probably going to win the first one. But if you train for Hyrox for a year, the triathlete is going to win the next one.\"*\n\n> **Rich Froning** (on doing hard things outside his comfort zone): *\"Nobody does CrossFit anymore. They just run.\"* (said jokingly about the trend at Mayhem)\n\n> **Hunter McIntyre** (on lactate threshold training): *\"When you get to the point where you feel that lactate is starting to form and your muscles are starting to overload, push a little bit further and stay there. Don't push so far that performance starts to drop. Sustained burning.\"*\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table: Athlete Coverage Status\n\n| Athlete | Hyrox Competitor? | Station Protocols Documented? | Key Contribution to Knowledge Base |\n|---------|-------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Rich Froning** | \u274c No (pursuing Iron Man instead) | N/A | GPP philosophy, CrossFit-to-endurance transition mindset |\n| **Rich Ryan** | \u2705 Elite 15, PR 54:28 | \u2705 Comprehensive (sleds, wall balls, threshold training) | Threshold training revolution, sled 3-pillar system, wall ball strategy |\n| **Hunter McIntyre** | \u2705 3x World Champion | \u2705 Partial (EMOM sled/erg, lactate threshold) | Lactate threshold training, nutrition discipline, EMOM protocols |\n| **Jake Dearden** | \u2705 Elite 15, Doubles qualifier | \u2705 Comprehensive (3-week published plan) | Most structured week-by-week periodization available |\n| **Jason Khalipa** | \u2705 Pro Doubles (1:07:13) | \u26a0\ufe0f Limited (race observations only) | CrossFit-to-Hyrox transition perspective, business/community insights |\n| **Dan Churchill** | \u2705 Training for sub-60 | \u26a0\ufe0f Limited (trained under Hunter) | Athlete learning journey, nutrition integration |\n\n---\n\n*This report synthesizes data from: The Rich Froning Podcast (Ep. 069), RMR Training Podcast (multiple episodes), John Get Strong Substack interview with Rich Ryan, Hybrid Fitness Media podcast with Jason Khalipa, Dan Churchill YouTube, Tom's Guide/inkl.com (Jake Dearden plan), hyroxtrainingplans.com, hyroxdatalab.com, YouTube channels of Rich Ryan, Hunter McIntyre, CrossFit Mayhem, and various Hyrox results databases (racekeep.com, hyroxy.com, roxlyfe.com).*",
