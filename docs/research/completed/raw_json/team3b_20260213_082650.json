Persist is a well thought-out program, it\u2019s not a kitchen sink workout randomly sprinkled with burpees.\n\n\u2026\n\n## Persist Offers Five Different Tracks To Choose From\n\nThere are five different tracks to choose from within the Persist program. All programs run on 6-week training cycles that typically build on movements and skills from the previous cycle.\n\nIn an introduction video to the program, Marcus Filly encourages athletes to stay on one track during the cycle to get the most benefit from the programming and progression. I did toggle a bit between tracks, but I mainly used Pillars.\nHere is what to expect from each training track:\n\n**Pillars Track:**Four, 60-minute workouts per week, focusing on functional fitness and compound movements like squat, bench, deadlift, and overhead press (plus conditioning finishers like EMOMS, AMRAPS, and burnout sets) **Pump Condition Track:**Five, 75-minute muscle-building and hypertrophy-style sessions with conditioning added at the end of most workouts **Pump Lift Track:**Five, 75-minute hypertrophy-style sessions without conditioning **Perform Track** **:**Five, 90 minute sessions that includes Olympic lifts and other functional fitness **Minimalist** **Track:**Five, 60-minute",

If you\u2019re already, say, lifting weights five days a week, and you want to add in cardio, you wouldn\u2019t add more workouts. Instead, Bare would advise you to cut back the lifting to three days a week, then add in two (or maybe three) days of running. A business owner and a father, he admits that he sometimes misses workouts.\n\n\u2026\n\n## How to Train Like a Hybrid Athlete Without Burning Out\n\n## Start Slow\n\nLike Bare said, you can\u2019t just jump into double sessions and ultra-intense, high-volume training. That's just fine. \"Whether you're just strength training or you're training hybrid, you need to start by deciding how many days you can truly commit to your workouts,\" says Samuel. \"Even if you're 'adding' cardio to a strength workout, you don't want to add workout time.\"\n\n**A good starting point for a hybrid program is four days of training per week** says Samuel. Stick to this for at least four weeks before you consider adding a fifth day of training or a two-a-day session into your regimen.",

Heck, I\u2019ve been through the fitness ringer myself, too.\n\nIn this Functional Bodybuilding Persist Review, I\u2019m going to share some insights with you about this workout program and how it offers a one-stop-shop for both training and active recovery (without the need for buying one of the best muscle recovery tools on the market).\n\nI\u2019ll give you a glimpse into my experience and share both the good and less favorable aspects of this program (of which there are only a few).\n\n### We\u2019ve Tested Over 50 Online Programs\n\nGarage Gym Reviews is staffed with a group of individuals that live and breathe fitness, with backgrounds ranging from certified personal trainers and nutrition coaches to Olympic athletes and gym owners.\n\nTo date, our expert product testers have used more than 50 online fitness programs.

Mobility and recovery is built-in to the warm-ups, cool-downs, and addressed on non-lifting days. It\u2019s also appropriate for folks with limited equipment. There are five different tracks you can choose from and one offers minimal or no equipment and you can still see results.\n\n## A Quick Look at the Functional Bodybuilding Persist Program\n\nFunctional Bodybuilding (FBB) was born when founder Marcus Filly hit a metaphorical wall in his athletic career. The pivot point came when he was feeling completely burnt out and physically broken after competing in the 2016 CrossFit Games (also after being a longtime CrossFit affiliate owner).\n\nThis low point helped reshape his training methodology. He committed to helping himself and his fellow athletes train for longevity with a focus on movement quality (versus quantity) and high-caliber warm-up and cool-down protocols.\n\n*RELATED: * *Best * *Warm-Up* * Exercises*\n\n### Before You Buy\n\n- If you sign up for the monthly billing option, you can get a free 2-week trial\n\n- Other than the Pump Lift track, you will have conditioning workouts programmed into nearly every session\n\n- Training cycles run 6 weeks, but when joining, you\u2019ll start on the current week of the program (not at the beginning)\n\n- While most workout tracks require a barbell and a pair of dumbbells there is one track that uses little to no equipment\n\n## Is the Functional Bodybuilding Persist Program Worth It?\n\nFirstly, it\u2019s worth noting that Persist is a program that has five different tracks you can choose from within the umbrella of Persist (I\u2019ll break down each track a little bit later when I get into the details of using the program).\n\nThat said, if you\u2019re looking for personal training and a program tailored specifically to you, that does exist on the Functional Bodybuilding website, but that is not something I\u2019ll be diving into in this review.\n\nSpeaking as a personal trainer, I would highly recommend this program (specifically the Minimalist and Pillars tracks) if you have some (or a lot of) experience with free weights and barbell training and want a program that may help you get stronger and recover faster.\n\nI think the Perform and Pump tracks are more suitable if you\u2019re an advanced lifter. These tracks will offer challenges even if you have years of experience and coaching under your belt.\n\nI would not recommend this program for the true beginner (even though the Minimalist track does not require much equipment). I personally think the training volume is too high if you\u2019re just getting your toes wet with resistance training.\n\n*RELATED: * *What is Resistance Training?*\n\n**Great for:**\n\n- Folks with some lifting experience\n\n- Advanced lifters\n\n- People who need accountability to do mobility and active recovery\n\n**Not recommended for:**\n\n- True beginners\n\n- Anyone who needs a specialized program\n\n- Folks who don\u2019t enjoy strength training\n\n## FBB Persist Program Specs\n\n|Price|$39/month; $99/quarter; $325/year|\n|--|--|\n|Workout tracks|Pillars, Pump Lift, Pump Condition, Perform, Minimalist|\n|Types of training|Minimal equipment workouts, hypertrophy, conditioning, and/or Olympic lifting|\n|Extras|Weekly emails, video messages from Marcus Filly, vast library of demo videos|\n|Gym membership required|No|\n|Workout per week|4-5 depending on track|\n|Mobility sessions per week|2-3 depending on track|\n## Using the Persist Program\n\nDuring the initial sign-up process I answered a few questions about my lifting experience, type of equipment I have access to, and my goals. After becoming a member, I got an email from Atom Training. I then followed instructions to Atom\u2019s web-based app. There I signed in using the same credentials I used to sign up on the FBB website.\n\nAfter logging in, the program automatically put me in the track best for me based on the information I provided during the questionnaire. I noticed it\u2019s easy to view the other tracks or change tracks using the main menu. From there, workouts are self-guided.\n\nBut don\u2019t let the term\n\n*self-guided* scare you off! Each workout has a quick coaches\u2019 note describing your focus for the day or preparing you for the hardest aspects of the workout.\n\nEach workout is broken down into different parts, including warm-up, main movements, accessories, and cool-down (except the program uses much more awesome terms like pre-fatigue, strength balance, and recovery).\n\nIn each section, the exercises are not only listed by name; they feature a demonstration video for every movement pulled from the FBB YouTube channel (which has 1,000 demonstration videos!).\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the videos don\u2019t seem to bog down the website at all. The videos quickly pop up and don\u2019t navigate you to another webpage (which I think is important because you\u2019ll be using a browser\u2014not an app\u2014to use this workout program). But I\u2019ll touch on the webpage stuff a little later.\n\nHowever, one thing to note is the fact the demo videos don\u2019t offer any instruction, it\u2019s purely a visual aid. The video quality is fantastic, so you can clearly see what\u2019s happening, but I\u2019m calling it out because, without a voiceover or explanation, it might not be ideal if you\u2019re brand new to lifting.\n\n*RELATED: * *6-Week Beginner * *Workout Program*\n\nAdditionally, all of the longer workouts that are longer than 60 minutes include a \u201cshort on time\u201d note to help you prioritize your lifts and get it done in less time. This usually looks like less overall volume (performing two sets versus four sets) and sometimes will even be cutting out the finisher or conditioning section.\n\n## Methodology Behind Persist\n\nAt the core of the Persist training program, Marcus Filly and his team use principles of progressive overload to help you achieve muscle size and strength. Persist is a well thought-out program, it\u2019s not a kitchen sink workout randomly sprinkled with burpees.\n\nBut what is progressive overload? Simply put, it\u2019s a way to tweak the stimulus lifting has on your muscles so you can keep progressing in your strength journey. Essentially, you will also run into a metaphorical wall of your own (much like Marcus Filly did) if you try to add five more pounds to the bar or one more rep to your sets every week.\n\nProgress isn\u2019t linear, and the Persit program from FBB addresses that head on. In all five tracks of the program, you will see nearly all of the principles of progressive overload show up, including load, repetitions, volume, rest period, range of motion, tempo, frequency, and degree of difficulty.\n\nIn a welcome video from Marcus Filly, he notes that there is a fine line between \u201cGetting a great training session and feeling like you didn\u2019t work hard enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr pushing it too much and sacrificing form\u2014potentially increasing your injury risk,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe typically don\u2019t use percentages of one rep maxes (1RM), but instead, we go by feel so that you can adapt to how you\u2019re feeling on a given day, as well as the workout at hand.\u201d\n\nThat said, some exercises will challenge you with a simple increase in weight from the week prior. Other movements will vary\u2014either from week to week or build progressions into the next training cycle\u2014by range of motion, rest time, or tempo.\n\nI was able to record your weights, time for conditioning exercises, and the way I felt at the beginning and end of the workout. So, just because the program is not based off of your 1RM doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s without progression.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say the barbell back squat was featured in the last 6-week cycle and showed up again in the next 6-week cycle. But instead of increasing the load, the program adds a tempo to the movement.\n\n*RELATED: * *How to Squat Heavier*\n\nIf the program calls for tempo, it will be listed next to the name of the exercise. The website provides a cheat sheet for reading tempo programming (and any other training modification) which is super helpful.\n\nFor example, if a back squat calls for \u201c32X1\u201d tempo, here is what to expect:\n\n- 3 \u2013 Moving smoothly, use 3 seconds to squat to full depth\n\n- 2 \u2013 Hold for 2 seconds at the bottom of the squat\n\n- X \u2013 Explode up as quickly as you can\n\n- 1 \u2013 Start the next repetition after 1 second\n\nThe order of the TEMPO numbers always goes as follows: Down, hold, up, pause.\n\n*RELATED: * *Benefits of Squats*\n\n## Functional Bodybuilding Persist Program Setup\n\nI think it\u2019s worth noting that the setup is not as easy as just downloading a new app. The Persist program from Functional Bodybuilding runs on a web-based app, so you won\u2019t find it in the Apple app store or Google Play.\n\nOnce you sign up with your email address and choose your billing cycle (monthly, quarterly, or annually), you\u2019ll get an email from the web-based app host called Atom Training.\n\nAlthough you\u2019ll be using Atom through a webpage browser, I didn\u2019t find it that cumbersome once I got started. During the setup process, Atom suggests saving the web address to your favorites so you can easily navigate the website, which I found helpful.\n\nI thought the lack of a traditional app was going to be annoying, but I really didn\u2019t have a problem with it. The one thing I noticed is that when I start my workouts, I almost always forget it\u2019s saved on my Safari browser, so I inadvertently browse through my apps at least once before I remember. I don\u2019t personally think this should be a dealbreaker for the program quality.\n\n## Persist Offers Five Different Tracks To Choose From\n\nThere are five different tracks to choose from within the Persist program. All programs run on 6-week training cycles that typically build on movements and skills from the previous cycle.\n\nIn an introduction video to the program, Marcus Filly encourages athletes to stay on one track during the cycle to get the most benefit from the programming and progression. I did toggle a bit between tracks, but I mainly used Pillars.\n\nHere is what to expect from each training track:\n\n**Pillars Track:**Four, 60-minute workouts per week, focusing on functional fitness and compound movements like squat, bench, deadlift, and overhead press (plus conditioning finishers like EMOMS, AMRAPS, and burnout sets) **Pump Condition Track:**Five, 75-minute muscle-building and hypertrophy-style sessions with conditioning added at the end of most workouts **Pump Lift Track:**Five, 75-minute hypertrophy-style sessions without conditioning **Perform Track** **:**Five, 90 minute sessions that includes Olympic lifts and other functional fitness **Minimalist** **Track:**Five, 60-minute\n\nI personally used the Pillars track for most of the workouts I did during my 3-month testing cycle. However, I moved while I was testing the program so it was clutch to toggle between Pillars and Minimalist training programs. Essentially, my home gym dwindled down to nothing more than a kettlebell and bands, so the Minimalist track was literally all I could handle (both equipment-wise and mentally).\n\n*RELATED: * *Best Resistance Bands *\n\n## Weekly Email Previews and Video Messages\n\nAnother thing you can expect from the Persist program (that you don\u2019t often see from even the best online workout programs) is a weekly email on Sundays that provides a preview of your upcoming week of workouts. You can always look back on old workouts, but future workouts are only released one week at a time. I personally think it\u2019s a little annoying that I can\u2019t see the entire 6-week cycle upfront, but I\u2019m not sure everyone will have that same opinion.\n\nWithin the email Marcus Filly also gets in front of the camera for a message to the members almost every week. It\u2019s usually a little pep-talk and a look ahead on what to expect (if there are new exercises or newly added blocks of conditioning). It\u2019s like a little pat on the back before you get into your week.\n\n## Functional Bodybuilding vs Juggernaut AI\n\nJuggernautAI\n\n### JuggernautAI\n\n### Product Highlights\n\n\n\nSmart powerlifting and powerbuilding program from Chad Wesley Smith, an accomplished strength athlete and owner of Juggernaut Training Systems.\n\n\n\nUses information such as your weight, training history, current fitness level and training load, personal records, goals, and ideal training schedule\n\n\n\nSuitable for any fitness level\n\n### Pros & Cons\n\n#### Pros\n\n- Extremely intuitive app experience\n\n- Super smart and responsive AI\n\n- Offers a two-week free trial to see if you like it\n\n#### Cons\n\n- Not the same as working with a real coach\n\n- Dashboard is a little confusing at first\n\n- Only for strength training (no cardio workouts)\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nJuggernautAI compiles your information to create a personalized powerlifting and powerbuilding workout experience.\n\nI think FBB Persist program compares best to Juggernaut AI. Many of the other programs we\u2019ve tested are either for general exercise (like iFIT or Peloton) or are legit actual personal training apps where you work one-on-one with a coach (like Future).\n\n*RELATED: * *Future App Review*\n\nJuggernaut AI is comparable to FBB Persist in the sense that they are similarly priced and self-guided workouts without a live coach. However, the focus of Juggernaut is powerlifting and the big three lifts (squat, bench, deadlift), while Persist has a broader approach to exercise selection and movement patterns. Persist also tackles recovery and mobility by seamlessly adding it to the end of every workout in addition to two or three sessions dedicated to mobility, not lifting.\n\nWhile both programs are going to help you get stronger, I think that Persist Training has a human element from Marcus Filly\u2019s personal burnout experience that can\u2019t be matched with a program designed by AI.\n\nRE\n\n*LATED: JuggernautAI Review*\n\n|FBB Persist|Juggernaut AI|\n|--|--|\n|Price|$39/month|$35/month|\n|Type of training|Functional movement, Olympic lifts|Powerlifting, powerbuilding|\n|Format|Web-based app|App|\n|Live coach|No|No|\n|Workouts per week|4-5|Custom|\n## Functional Bodybuilding Customer Experience\n\nFBB offers a live chat function in the bottom sign corner of your browser. Although I didn\u2019t have any pressing questions, it only took a few minutes to get a response on some simple membership questions.\n\nYou can also send emails to customer service at support@functional-bodybuilding.com.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re running into training questions or need more understanding about movements (maybe a certain lunge variation or the strict pull-up), you can always go to the FBB YouTube page, which is packed with resources.\n\n## Functional Bodybuilding Customer Reviews\n\nWhile the FFB website doesn\u2019t feature a traditional 5-star rating reviewing system, FBB does have a few glowing written testimonials feature on the website. In addition to that, the YouTube videos I\u2019ve personally browsed on the FBB channel have also been overwhelmingly positive and all pretty much all tie back to the Persist programming.\n\n## Final Verdict of My Functional Bodybuilding Persist Review\n\nIn the age of technology, there are endless ways to get coaching\u2014whether you\u2019re looking for form review on your power cleans or guidance to lose body fat.\n\nThat said, not all coaching and programming are created equal. There are plenty of folks on your social media feed selling wellness programs and workouts that will leave you spinning your wheels. Here at GGR, we\u2019re committed to helping you avoid those traps and guide you to find programming that is based on the core principles of strength training.\n\nAll this to say, the question is not: Is the Functional Bodybuilding Persist program any good? It\u2019s a high-quality program and will be enjoyable for a wide range of home gym owners and gym-goers alike.\n\nThe question is more, is Persist the right program for you? If you like the sound of what you\u2019ve read so far, here are some things I\u2019d keep in mind before you sign up:\n\n- You can go through the prescribed workouts at your own pace throughout the week, but I think it\u2019s worth noting that all tracks on the Persist program have you lifting four to five days per week, which might be a lot for some folks.\n\n- Most tracks include conditioning as part of the programming, something to keep in mind for anyone coming from a non-cardio background (like me!).\n\n- I personally wouldn\u2019t recommend this program for true beginners, but I do think that if you\u2019ve had some dumbbell and barbell lifting experience, you\u2019ll be just fine!\n\n## Functional Bodybuilding Persist Rating\n\n##### Functional Bodybuilding Persist Program\n\nRead our honest take on this hybrid programming in our Functional Bodybuilding Persist review.\n\n**Product Brand: **\n\nFunctional Bodybuilding\n\n**Product Currency: **\n\n\n\n**Product Price: **\n\n39\n\n**Product In-Stock: **\n\nInStock\n\n**Editor's Rating:**\n\n4.28\n\n## Functional Bodybuilding Persist: FAQs\n\n**What is the difference between functional bodybuilding and bodybuilding?**\n\nFunctional Bodybuilding (aka FBB) is a program and training resource founded by Marcus Filly. While there are aspects of bodybuilding with techniques to focus on peak muscle contractions like supersets, burnout sets, and AMRAPs, the program is a blend of functional training and muscle building together.\n\nFrom our experience, classic bodybuilding is less dynamic and doesn\u2019t focus on the same level of recovery as the FBB Persist program.\n\n**What is the functional bodybuilding method?**\n\nThe Functional Bodybuilding method (founded by Marcus Filly) blends traditional compound movements, unilateral strength, hypertrophy, and recovery into one program. Filly often says to Persist members that the goal is to \u201clook good, move well.\u201d\n\n**How many times a week should I do functional training?**\n\nThe Persist program through Functional Bodybuilding has members train with resistance four to five times per week, one or two supplemental mobility sessions, and one full rest day.\n\n",

He runs marathons, competes in triathlons, is a professional bodybuilder, and serves as a US Army infantry officer. Beyond his athletic prowess, Bare is a successful entrepreneur who founded a multi-million dollar nutrition and supplements company from scratch. He\u2019s also an acclaimed author and a leader in the fitness world, inspiring a growing community of athletes and enthusiasts through his educational YouTube content on health, fitness, and training.\n\n**This article dives into Nick Bare\u2019s workout routine and nutrition strategies, offering insights into the ultimate hybrid training program that spans multiple sports disciplines**.\n\n**Who Is Nick Bare?**\n\n|Full Name: Nick Bare|\n|--|\n|Weight|Height|Date of Birth|\n|(88.5-93.0 kg) 205-215 lbs|(182 cm) 6\u2019|08/01/1990|\n|Profession|Era|Nationality|\n|Hybrid Athlete, Fitness Coach, Nutritionist|2010s, 2020s|American|\nNick Bare is from Pennsylvania and later moved to Austin, Texas. He attended Indiana University of Pennsylvania and graduated with a degree in Nutrition in May 2013.\n\nHis road to fitness started in his early teens when he was recovering from an eating disorder that affected his health. To help with his recovery, Bare began hitting the gym and watching his diet.\n\n\u201cMy fitness journey started as a young teen, recovering from an eating disorder and transitioning my focus to a healthier and happier me.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Nick Bare\n\nHe went through recovery and learned much about eating right and resistance training. This served as motivation to overcome his eating disorder and be the healthiest version of himself.\n\nEventually, Bare overcame his eating disorder and became fit and healthy. His years of resistance training resulted in lean, well-sculpted, and strong muscles, which gave him all the confidence he needed.\n\nDuring college, Bare learned more about nutrition and studied it for his degree. He also joined the Army ROTC program and worked as an infantry officer after graduation. While in the Army, Bare graduated from three different schools: Air Assault School, Army Ranger School, and U.S. Airborne School. He also became the infantry platoon leader, working with the USA\u2019s finest soldiers and military officers.\n\nWhile in the Army, Nick Bare built his own company, Bare Performance Nutrition, because of his passion for fitness, nutrition, and health. He explained he was already preparing for life after four years with the army. \u201cDuring my entire time in the military, I was building my fitness company in preparation for my transition to civilian life after my 4-year contract,\u201d Bare said.\n\nWhen he was released at the end of his contract, he immediately opened a gym and focused on building the fitness company he started while in the Army. That company is now a well-known name in the fitness industry. Bare inspires others to be like him by sharing his experiences, further growing his brand and online presence. \u201cToday, I run my businesses out of the gym and share my life, business, and fitness journey on social media platforms,\u201d Bare stated.\n\nIn 2018, Nick Bare signed up for his first-ever marathon. After that experience, he learned how to balance endurance and strength training. He also signed up for triathlons like IronMan, 100-mile ultramarathons, and a bodybuilding competition. Through these experiences, he realized that specialization training wasn\u2019t an optimal approach but hybrid training.\n\n\u201cHybrid athlete training is the best way to train. The reason it\u2019s the best lies directly in the results. Improved body composition, longevity, and it\u2019s sustainable.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Nick Bare\n\n**Nick Bare\u2019s Workout Routine**\n\nNick Bare\u2019s workouts have changed over the years, but he commits to hitting every muscle group weekly through resistance training. He also considers cardiovascular conditioning a better part of his routine. This study shows cardiovascular exercises can improve heart rate, overall health, and quality of life (1).\n\nHe works out six days a week, doing cardio exercises in the morning and strength training in the evenings. When strength training, he uses the heaviest weights he can lift. Also, before he starts his training, he has a pre-workout shake. A study shows that pre-workouts before exercise can help delay fatigue and enhance exercise performance (2).\n\n**Leg Workout**\n\n|Exercises|Sets|Reps|\n|--|--|--|\n|Leg Extensions|4|12|\n|Hamstring Curls|4|10|\n|Back Squats|3|5|\n|Hack Squats|4|8|\n|Dumbbell Romanian Deadlifts|4|10|\n**Core Workout**\n\n|Exercises|Sets|Reps|\n|--|--|--|\n|Hanging Leg Raises|4|15-20|\n|Cable Crunches|4|15-20|\n|The Glute-Ham Developer Sit-Ups|4|15-20|\n|Obliques V-Ups|4|15 on each side|\n**Arms & Shoulders Workout**\n\n|Exercises|Sets|Reps|\n|--|--|--|\n|Push Ups|4|25|\n|Pull Ups|4|10|\n|Barbell Curls|4|8|\n|Triceps Pushdowns|4|12|\n|Preacher Curls|4|10|\n|Triceps Dips|4|10|\n|Hammer Curls|4|10|\n|Triceps Extensions|4|12|\n**Back Workout**\n\n|Exercises|Sets|Reps|\n|--|--|--|\n|Pull Ups|4|AMRAP|\n|Deadlifts|3|5|\n|Lat Pulldowns|4|8|\n|Pendlay Rows|4|12|\n|Low Rows|4|10|\n|Dumbbell Rows|4|10|\n**Chest Workout**\n\nBefore starting his chest workouts, he does three cardio sets using a Concept2 bike.

He does morning runs and strength training in the evening to work different muscle groups. Bare trains six days a week and uses the last day to rest and recovery.\n\nFor his resistance training, he typically does four sets with eight to twelve reps while using the heaviest weight he can lift. Before starting his major exercises, he does a lot of light weightlifting, and resistance band stretches to warm up and get his blood flowing.\n\n**Nutrition**\n\nNick Bare\u2019s approach to nutrition involves eating foods rich in protein, carbohydrates, healthy fats, and other essential nutrients. He also likes supplements, especially those that add essential nutrients to his diet. Some of his supplements include BCAAs, protein shakes, and pre-workouts.\n\nFollow Generation Iron on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter for more workout approaches!\n\n**References**\n\n- Nystoriak, M.

Transcript\n{ts:0} hey we're adding a new program track to persist called pump lift and it is all\n{ts:4} about building muscle so I'm going to get a little warm up in get the blood flowing I'll walk you through how we\n{ts:9} structure this type of workout so you can get a crazy pump let's go [Music]\n{ts:18} [Music] all the viewers need to know that having palm trees\n{ts:28} Suns and umbrella drinks on your pants\n{ts:34} increases your strength but 12 percent\n{ts:39} it's called around the world a little bit of this a little bit of that a little bit of this\n{ts:44} keep going around [Music] all right so we got a little blood flow\n{ts:54} in you saw me doing that around the world on the cardio machines now moving into something called a pre-fatigue\n{ts:60} pre-fatigue is basically just taken some of the muscle groups that we're going to hit hard today in our strength intensity\n{ts:66} so shoulders I'm working calves I'm gonna be doing some squatting some deep range of motion squatting but I'm doing\n{ts:73} a Bradford Z press and a calf raise I'm just slowly ramping up some of the weight but this is higher rep blood flow\n{ts:82} get a little pre-pump going on before we go into our core strength intensity lifts which will be coming next now the\n{ts:90} goal with this pre-fatigue is not to get so tired that it impacts your strength intensity I find it's really a great\n{ts:96} opportunity to just prepare the brain for the strength yeah you could just go and do your strength movements and do a\n{ts:103} lot of extra warm-up sets but by moving with a couple different exercises like on any given day we might choose some\n{ts:111} different patterns that help to like Den range of motion Works in different positions I'm going to do a press as\n{ts:117} part of my strength intensity but today for pre-fatigue I'm doing Bradford press which just helps me work the behind the\n{ts:125} neck position so this is not what I'm going to do for the heavy lifts but I can do it\n{ts:131} as part of this pre-fatigue just make sure I'm hitting all these different ranges\n{ts:136} native ranges of motion on my shoulder keep my Mobility up focus on a couple\n{ts:143} isolation lists like calf raise just a good way to hit the entire body in addition to\n{ts:151} what's to come which is heavier harder more intense strength lifting [Music]\n{ts:166} one of the cool things about pump lift is that we're really getting down to just focusing on lifting and as an\n{ts:173} option what you're going to see me using today is a variety of different machines you already saw the calf raise machine\n{ts:177} now I'm using the smith machine there might be some other machines that are mixed into this program and they're\n{ts:182} always going to be an alternative if you're working in a conventional gym where you have access to this stuff all\n{ts:189} of our programs persist programs are always written with the home gym person in mind so you can do pump lift at home\n{ts:196} you don't need a Smith machine you don't need a seated cap we have all alternatives to that that work just as\n{ts:201} well but if you're in a facility like ours or a conventional gym where you have access to the stuff you're going to\n{ts:207} get to play with some of these tools which I think is just really fun and a great way to build in some stability so\n{ts:212} you can overload and push and really focus on muscles that you want to grow first exercise of the day is a back\n{ts:230} supported barbell press this can also be done with kettlebells or with dumbbells I'm using the smith\n{ts:236} machine press four working sets in the eight to ten rep range trying to get somewhere\n{ts:242} between one or two left reps left in reserve so that was my first set 105 pounds I\n{ts:251} probably could have done a couple more reps so I'm gonna increase my weight a little bit I got three more working sets\n{ts:256} to do I'm gonna I just wanna I just wanna go\n{ts:288} that was probably a nine or ten I don't think I could have gotten another one okay I'm moving into my second big\n{ts:295} intensity lift this is going to be for the lower body we're doing a reverse lunge to a deficit I'm gonna be focused\n{ts:301} on quad dominance on this one so I'm going to adjust my position make this a quad Focus uh reverse lunge and that's\n{ts:309} going to really stick with this pattern of the Friday session in pump lift this cycle is shoulders quads and triceps\n{ts:317} focused so that's what we're going to be really getting into today I'm going to show you how I do it with this\n{ts:322} particular lift I don't know [Music]\n{ts:345} so the format on this particular lift we're doing alternating legs every 75 seconds so right leg for eight to ten\n{ts:356} reps then when I get to the 75 second Mark or a minute and 15 switch to the left\n{ts:363} we're going back and forth for four sets per side [Music]\n{ts:372} [Laughter] [Music] no matter what Implement you end up\n{ts:384} using for your strength intensity just make sure you're tracking your results because we're going to be using\n{ts:388} Progressive overload every week to make sure you're doing a little bit more than the previous week that way you can make\n{ts:394} sure you're progressing and you're giving your muscles the stimulus that they need to either grow or maintain\n{ts:400} depending on what your goals are now time supersets like every 75 seconds that I'm using on this reverse lunge\n{ts:406} they are going to limit the amount of rest you have in between sets that's okay because you don't always need to\n{ts:412} rest two three minutes to get a good strength stimulus in this case I'm getting a two minute rest\n{ts:420} when I go from right back to my right leg so there's plenty of time between the actual working muscles of my right\n{ts:426} side I am fatiguing a little bit by having these short rest periods that's why I provide you with rep ranges eight\n{ts:432} to ten reps so you can always aim for that 10 rep range but if you start to fatigue at the same weight you can still\n{ts:438} hit eight reps on all of your sets and get plenty of high intensity volume to really stimulate the muscle growth and\n{ts:446} the strength gains that you're looking for [Music]\n{ts:458} now we're moving on to strength balance we're going to be hitting focused tricep work this is a superset where I'm going\n{ts:464} to be doing a JM press you can do this with a free barbell or the Smith machine obviously I'm opting for the Smith\n{ts:469} machine today then once you finish five to ten reps on a JM press make those tough you're going to flip over and\n{ts:476} you're going to immediately do an inverted skull crusher that's basically just a tricep Too Faced type push-up\n{ts:483} while your hands are on the Smith machine bar or another bar or even a bench I call this the strength balance\n{ts:490} section of training so we did two pretty big intensity lifts we did the Press we did the lunge those are we're gonna\n{ts:498} really be trying to push Progressive overload every week being very good note takers the strength balance section yeah\n{ts:505} you want to be pushing yourself from week to week but because we're combining movements we're doing this type of\n{ts:510} Agonist superset where we're really hitting triceps in two different ways it can be hard to be very precise about\n{ts:517} your loading and how much going up so the goal here is just to get high level of effort on every set I'm trying to\n{ts:523} push somewhere in that one to two reps from failure on both the JM and the inverted skull crusher so that's what\n{ts:530} we're getting into now [Music] see your\n{ts:536} kisses no [Music] no no I don't want to hear\n{ts:547} [Music] we're moving on to the final section of pump lift which is a hypertrophy\n{ts:562} finisher basically just one more superset to try and get into some of the muscles that we've already trained\n{ts:568} heavily in our strength intensity section we're gonna go a quad shoulder superset\n{ts:575} we're gonna do a leg extension I'm using the machine you can also do a banded leg extension and then we're going to go\n{ts:581} into a dumbbell lateral seated after two sets I'll talk about what we're going to be doing for\n{ts:588} intensification but we're basically going to do a drop set on our final set today so\n{ts:593} I'm choosing the recline position on this so that my hips are somewhat extended give me a little bit more of a\n{ts:599} stretch at my quad this is the position I'm using and I'm going to work up and do 10 to 15 reps find something that's\n{ts:606} hard in the 10 to 15 rep range and then on the last set we'll do that drop set which I'll explain in a minute\n{ts:613} [Music] [Music] okay for my last set of the day on each\n{ts:638} exercise I'm gonna perform a single drop set to do this correctly I've already\n{ts:643} figured out what weight is getting me pretty darn close to failure in the rep range that I'm after which is 10 to 15.\n{ts:651} so I'll go do a set of 15 hard reps to failure basically have to take the\n{ts:659} first set to failure so a set of leg extensions to failure then I'm going to drop it by 30 immediately and then keep\n{ts:668} going with my reps until I hit failure a second time that's a drop set I'll do the same thing\n{ts:674} over here this is where it gets really spicy but it's the last thing of the day before a\n{ts:680} little bit of a stretch and then we're off for our weekend [Music]\n{ts:691} foreign [Music] if you do a drop set correctly\n{ts:696} they're horrific they're the worst so hard I see people using drop sets because they don't like to go to failure\n{ts:706} they kind of get close-ish and they don't push themselves and they're like oh just go down and wait that's kind of\n{ts:710} like an easy out but if you do it right you go all the way to failure on each set\n{ts:717} they're brutal [Music] ah\n{ts:731} [Music] pumplift was born out of uh a need just like everything else that\n{ts:739} we've done with functional bodybuilding there was a certain group of individuals within\n{ts:746} our persist membership and also on our staff who are doing our training program pump\n{ts:752} and pump has always been a program that was focused on lifting with a touch of conditioning at the end and those\n{ts:758} conditioning sessions were really designed to complement a muscle building hypertrophy focused training program\n{ts:764} from functional bodybuilding we had a group of people that were like hey I really want to just focus on my\n{ts:770} lifting right now like the lifting has been great I always tend towards doing more\n{ts:775} conditioning I'll go for runs I'll go for walks I like to mountain bike but I really just want to maximize my\n{ts:780} time in the gym lifting and I love the style that you guys lift in with pump how can I do more of it is there a way I\n{ts:787} can take the conditioning out and put in another superset or put in a bit more hypertrophy work\n{ts:793} so we started with Cliff cohut who's our director of operations he was telling me that he wanted to do that I was like\n{ts:800} okay let me write you a program based off pump that would do that he also started going through a muscle\n{ts:806} building nutrition phase and after several months he was just having such great success\n{ts:813} that I was like well I kind of want to do this and it was perfectly timed with me kind of injuring my shoulder my\n{ts:819} shoulder was just I was pushing it too much on a variety of different areas of training and I\n{ts:825} needed to like dial back my conditioning intensity and maybe my skilled based Dynamic movements so it's like perfect\n{ts:831} time for me to just focus on pump lift hypertrophy training only and I'll get all my conditioning and all my\n{ts:839} activity through walking and so for the last five months that's all I've done walk\n{ts:845} and lift pump lift and now we have probably 150 people in our membership testing this program\n{ts:853} and with the feedback that they've given us and with the time spent developing the program I feel really confident that\n{ts:860} this is something that people are going to love and it absolutely is going to check all the boxes that people are\n{ts:865} looking for who want great pump big lifts and they want to save their conditioning for outside the\n{ts:872} gym and for those of you who love to train in a conventional gym mix in some machines and some more stability with\n{ts:879} your training like a Smith machine we got you covered this is the place to be [Music]\n",

Transcript\n{ts:0} I've been covering a lot recently on what you need to do with your nutrition\n{ts:3} to build visible muscle and I've mentioned a lot how effort in the gym is a huge part of this you're going to need\n{ts:10} to put in the hard work and lift heavy in addition to being serious about your protein and calorie intake but there's\n{ts:16} very little information out there on what that effort should actually look like in the gym should you just do five\n{ts:23} reps of everything should you superset how much rest between sets So today we're really going to dig into the\n{ts:30} training details and if you really want to learn the best way is to go try these concepts for yourself and see how they\n{ts:37} feel on your body [Music] [Applause]\n{ts:48} hey this video is brought to you today by my friends at element element is a tasty electrolyte mix with everything\n{ts:54} you need and nothing you don't that means lots of salt and no sugar element was formulated to help anyone with their\n{ts:62} electrolyte needs and is perfectly suited to folks following keto low carb or paleo diets element contains a\n{ts:70} science-backed electrolyte ratio of 1 000 milligrams of sodium 200 milligrams of potassium and 60 milligrams of\n{ts:78} magnesium per packet the perfect ratio I have found for me what I love the most is that there's no junk no sugar no\n{ts:86} coloring no artificial ingredients no gluten no fillers no BS as a member of our community element has a very special\n{ts:94} offer for you you can claim your free element sample pack simply by going over to the website\n{ts:101} drinkelement.com forward slash Marcus Philly to get yours and if you're wondering what my favorite flavor is\n{ts:108} raspberry salt mixed with some ice water is delicious I hope you enjoy so you want to build muscle and you've been\n{ts:116} eating more protein and high quality foods but how do you put those calories towards muscle instead of fat once\n{ts:123} you're fueled up with quality calories your energy and Recovery should feel elevated so you can get after some great\n{ts:130} lifting sessions Progressive overload is always The Guiding Light in effective resistance training but especially so in\n{ts:139} this case here are specific examples from the persist pump track and how to approach them for maximum muscle gain\n{ts:147} remember these are part of a progression that builds week to week so check out persist for full workouts and training\n{ts:155} Cycles but today I'll introduce you to the concepts and why they work the first is intensity plus back offsets here's\n{ts:163} how I'd approach a back squat progression for muscle gain you'll do four working sets and the first three\n{ts:170} will be six reps each I'm gonna give you a Tempo 20x1 that means two seconds down explode back up and pause at the top for\n{ts:180} one second in between each rep this Tempo is going to be similar to how you see a lot of people moving naturally in\n{ts:186} the gym but the two seconds down means you'll have some element of control over the lift instead of just diving down to\n{ts:194} the bottom for each of these working sets you're going to build intensity you might do a couple warm-up sets and then\n{ts:201} dive into your first set where you make the effort a six out of 10 on the rpe scale the second set increase that\n{ts:209} intensity to 7 out of ten build some weight and then on the third set we're going to make this your top set and\n{ts:216} you're going to try and hit an 8 out of 10 on the rpe scale what that means is that you only have a couple reps left in\n{ts:223} the tank before you hit form failure to make sure your rest is consistent and you don't hop on Instagram between your\n{ts:230} sets you're going to start a new set every two and a half minutes that's going to give you about two minutes rest\n{ts:236} in between sets but it's going to hold you accountable to a running clock now for your fourth set which is going to\n{ts:242} happen at the 7 minute and 30 second mark on the clock you're going to strip some weight off the bar from your last 8\n{ts:249} out of 10 effort set take 80 percent of what you last lifted and in this final set we'll call it your back offset now\n{ts:257} on this set instead of pausing at the top for one second after each rep You're Gonna Keep tension on the muscle the\n{ts:264} entire time you're going to lower in two seconds come right back up and then immediately begin your next repetition\n{ts:272} going two seconds down to the bottom there are zero causes at the bottom or the top of every rep and unlike your\n{ts:279} last set which was only for six reps you are going to try and get as many reps as possible on this final set while still\n{ts:287} hitting that Tempo I promise this will hurt okay moving into the second intensity format this is reverse pyramid\n{ts:296} sets here's another format that I'm using in this cycle of persist for the cyclist front squat which shows up every\n{ts:303} other week this is a terrific quad developer this time we're going to make sure to go heavy on the first working\n{ts:310} set and when you come back to the progression you're going to be trying to beat that weight that you did last time\n{ts:316} in the previous weeks we're going to be working with rep ranges here which are terrific for allowing you to really go\n{ts:322} for it if you feel good but also give you some wiggle room to dial back if your form starts to suffer we all have\n{ts:329} off days where lifting with specific reps and percentages just doesn't work out well maybe you slept poorly or you\n{ts:336} had a stressful conversation before walking into the gym your training doesn't have to be a total failure if\n{ts:341} you're not firing on all cylinders so here's how the reverse pyramid goes the first set you're going to do four to six\n{ts:347} reps at a three zero X zero Tempo you're gonna try to get six but if you only get four or five without your form or the\n{ts:354} tempo breaking down then no worries this first set from four to six reps have to be extremely tough I want it to feel\n{ts:363} like you're top set for the day which means you'll have done anywhere from two to four warm-up sets before this to\n{ts:370} figure out what that starting weight is going to be now we're on on every two minute clock here so at the next two\n{ts:376} minute Mark we start the next set but this time we're going to be doing more reps at a slightly lower weight you'll\n{ts:383} take off five to ten percent off the bar and you'll go for six to eight reps this time as opposed to four to six now\n{ts:391} you're on to set three at the four minute mark You're Gonna Go for eight to ten reps this time so adding more reps\n{ts:397} but again lowering the weight on the bar by five to ten percent lighter weight more reps the same three seconds down\n{ts:404} with no pause in the tempo always trying to hit the upper rep range if you can and the next time you come back to this\n{ts:411} progression you'll start that first set even heavier than you did last time the rep ranges will give you some wiggle\n{ts:417} room if you can't get as many reps but you can really really get after that first set with this format and don't be\n{ts:423} afraid to make that first set super tough moving into the next lifting format Agonist supersets one of my\n{ts:431} favorite ways to think about combining movements into a superset is whether they target the same muscle groups\n{ts:437} similar ones or opposing ones each approach has its benefits and drawbacks but an Agonist superset is especially\n{ts:445} powerful for small muscle groups like The triceps these areas need a lot of volume to see change so we're going to\n{ts:452} hit them back to back at slightly different angles until you basically turn into a quivering pile of jelly you\n{ts:460} may go up to and even Beyond failure by the end of the second exercise but these exercises have a lower impact on your\n{ts:469} body than big compound lifts like the deadlift and the format makes sure you get a peak training stimulus which will\n{ts:476} facilitate muscle growth every three minutes and 30 seconds you'll begin a new set it starts with 8 to 10 reps of a\n{ts:484} JM press at a three zero X zero Tempo pushing your effort very high close to failure if you haven't done a JM press\n{ts:493} you set up like a narrow grip bench press as you lower the barbell down you try and bring it more or less to your\n{ts:500} throat and you keep your elbows right alongside your ribs and you do not let the elbows drop down lower than your\n{ts:508} chest what you should feel is a big tricep stimulus after your JM press you go directly into the second movement\n{ts:517} which is a dumbbell tricep extension on your back also known as a skull crusher you'll do 12 to 15 of those and then\n{ts:527} rest we're going to repeat this same cycle for three total sets and remember you're doing a new one every three\n{ts:534} minutes and 30 seconds this can progress with similar movements each and every week like a narrow grip bench press with\n{ts:542} a seated dumbbell overhead tricep extension we're using different tricep movements that hit different angles so\n{ts:547} that you hit every aspect of that muscle over the course of the training cycle now this may be a lot of detail to take\n{ts:553} in but if you want to build muscle here are the takeaways for your training first work hard and use effort wisely\n{ts:561} you can't do everything at a 10 out of 10 make a plan for how you're going to build where you'll back off and where\n{ts:569} your toughest sets should be second there's more to the equation than adding weight on the bar yes that's part of it\n{ts:576} but your weights can't infinitely go up forever so use rep ranges different tempos shorter or longer rest and\n{ts:585} selecting slightly different movements to keep challenging your body to adapt third be a good note taker the details\n{ts:592} of your training will help you progress each week so you can find a way to win almost every day that you train by\n{ts:599} getting one more rep bumping up your weight a little or even moving with more quality and confidence in your training\n{ts:606} and as always let me know if you have questions and go try these concepts for yourself you can find them in persist\n{ts:613} especially in the pump training track and you can try it out for free for two weeks at functional

Transcript\n{ts:0} foreign [Music]\n{ts:2} [Applause] [Music] [Applause]\n{ts:6} lift from start to finish I'm going to show you how I get it done here we go [Music]\n{ts:18} [Music] once a week in pump condition we take the pre-fatigue that we do every other\n{ts:34} day of the week and the same as pump lift and we turn it into something called aerobic bodybuilding that means\n{ts:40} we get our start with a little bit of an aerobic piece rowing and then two movements that are\n{ts:46} going to complement the muscles and the movement patterns of the day\n{ts:50} rear delt flies dual kettlebell High pulls really warm up the posterior chain the rear delts\n{ts:57} and the back to go along with rowing because today is pulling in [Music]\n{ts:75} so with pump condition our lifting it's all about building muscle but also being efficient with our training so we\n{ts:84} utilize a lot more supersets in this program track the first superset I'm doing\n{ts:89} for strength intensity is a t-bar row for eight reps controlled tough reps and then after about a 15 second transition\n{ts:100} I'm going right into a Max effort set of Pull-Ups that combination\n{ts:107} back to back it's going to tax a lot of the same muscle groups upper back a little bit of lower back and definitely\n{ts:114} biceps so these are Agonist supersets we use them from time to time in pump condition as a way to pack on more work\n{ts:123} into a shorter amount of time and because of the back to back nature here where the movements are targeting the\n{ts:129} same parts of the body I'm getting a lot of stimulus again without having to max out my weight\n{ts:136} [Music] [Music] I think everyone is looking for the\n{ts:153} secret to building muscle to building strength there's a lot of different methods out there and a lot of different\n{ts:159} approaches but the one constant is that effort has to be there and whether you're doing a pump condition workout a\n{ts:167} pump lift program or one other program that's out there all the principles mean nothing if\n{ts:174} you're not actually taking yourself into that high high effort Zone on your working sets so people call it rpe rate\n{ts:182} of perceived exertion or reps in reserve rir whatever it whatever it is that you use\n{ts:189} to measure your effort and become objective about it you need to start shooting for the upper end of what\n{ts:195} you're capable of this format superset of one exercise for weight into another exercise for Max\n{ts:203} reps at body weight is a terrific way to take you into that effort Zone that's going to produce results and that's what\n{ts:210} I'm always after with my programs is what can get somebody safely into that effort Zone depending on their training\n{ts:218} experience this and these program tracks are a fantastic way to do that so we got the big movements out of the way for the\n{ts:225} day that was the t-bar row right into pull up Max effort now we're moving on to a piece that we call the strength\n{ts:231} balance section of pump condition we're doing a prone incline bench elbowing row that's going to really Target the rear\n{ts:238} delts bringing the elbows high and out to the side and then on the alternate sets we're doing alternating dumbbell\n{ts:245} curls so we start with this exercise rest about a minute do this exercise rest about a minute this exercise you\n{ts:253} keep the rest periods relatively short but this superset allows us to get more work done in a shorter amount of time\n{ts:260} [Music] [Applause] [Music]\n{ts:281} but Marcus supersets are those actually the best way to build muscle look if you want the best way to build\n{ts:288} muscle the most proven methods that are going to maximize your hypertrophy maximize your muscle gains\n{ts:295} yeah perhaps supersets are not the best way to go but\n{ts:300} we're not necessarily here to create world champion bodybuilders we're here to make people who have a limited amount\n{ts:306} of time to build muscle to get a lot of work done in a short amount of time so that they can also keep up their\n{ts:312} cardiovascular system they can work on building their capacity and they can still get a hell of a stimulus and great\n{ts:321} intensity out of their weight training by using these methods so if you want a more focused muscle building approach\n{ts:329} that doesn't use supersets go try pump lift but for today we're mixing it all together we're getting the best of both\n{ts:336} worlds [Music] [Music]\n{ts:368} hey pump condition gets its name from the fact that we do conditioning on every single session pump condition is\n{ts:376} muscle building combined with aerobic development through conditioning work this particular superset or interval\n{ts:383} that I'm doing involves rowing kettlebell deadlifts Farmers carries and body rows the combination is every three\n{ts:393} minutes start a new set you're gonna Row for 9 to 12 calories you're going to do six deadlifts\n{ts:400} a hundred foot carry six more deadlifts 12 body rows movement patterns similar targeting\n{ts:408} those same muscles we've been working on all day but we're getting our heart rate spiked\n{ts:413} at the beginning so that there's a little bit of fatigue when we go into some of these movements\n{ts:419} here we go [Music] each one is taking me two minutes which\n{ts:462} is giving me about a minute rest every set my grip is definitely becoming an issue\n{ts:470} got a bit a lot of pulling all week and that sustained Farmers carry definitely challenges the grip\n{ts:477} some people might be asking Marcus is a deadlift actually\n{ts:484} appropriate on a polling day and the answer is yes even though the deadlift is taxing my hamstrings and my\n{ts:493} glutes a little bit what I'm getting is some lower and mid-back work and a lot\n{ts:499} of scap stability so lots having to engage rear delts having to work to keep those weights pinned to my side\n{ts:507} as I perform my deadlifts and then of course the carry the farmers carry big on the traps big on the grip which are\n{ts:516} both very much a part of a pulling day here goes the last set\n{ts:521} [Music] hey check the description down below if you want to hit this full workout I'll\n{ts:554} have details down there and stay tuned for the launch of pump condition July 3rd Monday get started with us see how\n{ts:563} this whole thing unfolds over six weeks of a continuously programmed Progressive training program\n{ts:570} thanks for joining me [Music]

          "snippet": "# How Nick Bare Conquered Hyrox\n\n### The world's most prominent Hybrid athlete takes on the Hyrox elite\n\nNick Bare is the world\u2019s most prominent hybrid fitness athlete. For over a decade, he\u2019s created videos focused on lifting, running, and nutrition, achieving some incredible feats, including a 2:39 marathon and a 700 lb deadlift.\n\nIn August, Nick announced that he would be making his Hyrox debut in Dallas, competing against a field that included some of the sport\u2019s most elite athletes.\n\n## How would the original hybrid athlete compare to some of the world\u2019s best in the sport?\n\nWell, he ended up doing incredibly well.\n\nNick finished with a time of 1:05:42, placing 9th out of 207 athletes in the Pro Division. This time ranked him in the top 8% of all time Hyrox Pro times.\n\nHere\u2019s how the race unfolded (Nick is shown in red; the other top 100 racers are in blue):\n\nNick Bare kept pace with the best in the field for the first 20 minutes \u2014 he was in third place coming into the sled pull \u2014 but then lost ground in the middle stages (especially during the burpees). He was able to recover on the lunges, but was then a little off the pace on the wall balls.\n\nHere\u2019s how his race compared to Dylan Scott, the eventual race winner. Nick matched Dylan\u2019s running pace for much of the event and posted similar times in the sled push, farmers carry, and lunges. The gaps primarily opened up on the sled pull, burpees, row, and surrounding runs.\n\nOverall, this was an incredibly strong performance. Hyrox demands a combination of strong aerobic capacity and muscular endurance, and the 10+ years Nick has spent developing those qualities really showed.\n\nHere\u2019s how he described his training leading up to the race:\n\nConsistent running and strength training remained a core throughout his preparation, but he also incorporated Hyrox-specific sessions to sharpen his skills for the event.\n\nMy sense is that with more specific focus he\u2019ll be able to bring down his burpee, sled pull, row, and wall ball times to a level consistent with the rest of his stations. These are among the most technical Hyrox movements, and it simply takes time to become efficient with these movement patterns.\n\nHere are some excellent Hyrox training resources inspired by Nick\u2019s journey so far:\n\nDylan Scott (the winner of Hyrox Dallas) has a great Instagram detailing his training. He incorporates a lot of long erg work at varying intensities.\n\nNick detailed his Hyrox journey in a 16-part series on his YouTube channel.\n\nNick appeared on the Rox Lyfe podcast, where he discussed the training insights shared above.\n\nNick also appeared on the RMR Training podcast (co-hosted by the second-place finisher in Dallas), where he delved into his training and mindset.\n\nAll of these are great resources for learning more about this emerging sport!\n\nThanks for reading John Get Strong!
