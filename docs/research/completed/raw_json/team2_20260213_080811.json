          "snippet": "Since then, he\u2019s completed 11 Hyrox races in 48 hours \u2013 a reward for recovering from two slipped discs \u2013 and has become a world champion, winning the Men\u2019s Doubles title at the 2024 Hyrox World Championships in Nice, France, with partner Marc Dean. This year, he set himself the goal of competing solo at the big one, Hyrox\u2019s Elite 15 World Championships; at the time of writing, Dearden has just qualified for his spot.\n\n\u2026\n\n*Men\u2019s Health*: How did you find your way into Hyrox?\n\n**Jake Dearden:** Hyrox didn\u2019t appeal to me at the start, but I got talked into it, ended up going to one without really training for it and did well in my age group. I thought, \u2018If I put my mind to this, I might do okay,\u2019 so I did a 12-week block where I specifically trained for Hyrox. I came back and got the world record for my age group in the open category.\n*MH:* **How has your training evolved since then?**\n\n**JD:** For a long time, my main focus was running. There were a lot of professional runners or close-to-professional runners, triathletes and so on, who were coming into the sport and doing really well. So I thought, \u2018I need to get better at running.\u2019 It\u2019s half of the sport, after all.\n\n\u2026\n\n*MH*: Did you take anything else from Tom or athletes like him?\n\n**JD:** It\u2019s looking at the elite attitude of these people and how, even if I thought I was giving everything, I definitely wasn\u2019t. These people are just so much more advanced \u2013 in terms of the preparation and analysis and never doing anything that\u2019s just random. Everything is done to benefit their training so they can move forwards and win.\n\n\u2026\n\n*MH*: What advice would you give to people looking to train for Hyrox?\n\n**JD:** The best piece of advice I can give is train as much as you can recover from. My job at the moment is to train and become the best at Hyrox. If you\u2019re looking at my training and thinking, \u2018I need to do that amount,\u2019 but you\u2019ve got a full-time job, you\u2019ve got family and you\u2019re only sleeping four hours a night because you\u2019ve got little kids, it\u2019s just not going to work.\n\n\u2026\n\n**JD:** I\u2019m quite boring with my training. I like to do the same movements week in, week out so I can see progress. I usually split up my running and my strength until about five to six weeks out from a race. Then I might swap out a couple of sessions so I\u2019m doing some weights and then going straight into running, to practise running under fatigue. That prepares my body. But I think working on your running separately is going to be much more beneficial than trying to do everything fatigued all the time.\n\n\u2026\n\n*MH*: Do you prioritise any particular part of a Hyrox race?\n\n**JD:** Think about a race in order of importance, so starting off with your SkiErg [the first workout station] \u2013 that\u2019s the most important exercise. If your heart rate skyrockets at the ski and you struggle, that\u2019s going to fatigue you for the rest of the race. But if you get fatigued at the burpees [the fourth station], you\u2019ve had a good first half of the race. You need to focus on these things in order of importance, but don\u2019t neglect any of them. If your wall balls really suffer, work on them.",

He writes\n\n*Legendary*, a newsletter sharing science-backed, actionable insights on nutrition, performance, and recovery, and he's currently chasing his own elite goal: a sub-60 Hyrox.\n\n*The Hybrid Letter* sat down with Dan to talk about his journey from rugby to hybrid, the surprising gaps in how athletes understand nutrition, the power of timing your meals, and what it really takes to balance performance, recovery, and life.\n\n\u2026\n\nTHL: How did you get into hybrid training?Hybrid\u2019s been around way longer than people realize. It\u2019s just training across multiple fitness modalities. The decathlon and triathlon are historical examples.\n\nDC:\n\nI grew up playing rugby, and our training was intense\u2014weights, sprints, long efforts, skills. I loved it. Honestly, I loved the training even more than the game. It gave me a solid foundation in programming, which became part of my role as a strength and conditioning coach. I took that philosophy and applied it to the way I now train for Hyrox. It\u2019s the same methodology, just refined.\n\n\u2026\n\nTHL: Can you share a bit about your philosophy when it comes to training this way and nutrition?\n\nDC:Hyrox is amazing because it motivates people to get off the couch and train for something. It\u2019s inspiring to see all levels of fitness out there competing.\n\nThe first step is knowing where you are. If you\u2019re at the elite level, you\u2019re chasing that extra 1%. But if you\u2019re newer, the priority is building a strong foundation through proper fueling. Most of my audience is either elite or slightly above average and looking to get better, so I focus a lot on meal timing and overall intake.\n\n\u2026\n\nLeadville last year taught me the value of preparation. It\u2019s about putting in the reps and improving 1% every day. Work can be hectic\u2014this is my personal challenge, and I love it, even if I\u2019m not naturally fast.\n\nTHL: Any challenges along the way that surprised you? DC:I remember watching my first Elite 15 race. Before I did my first Hyrox, I knew it wouldn\u2019t be easy\u2014but I was the fit guy. I could row, wall ball, do almost everything else and usually finish near the top.",

          "snippet": "Hunter McIntyre is a 6-time obstacle course racing (OCR) world champion, 4-time OCR national champion, the reigning\n\n*Broken Skull Ranch *champion (the television show hosted by Stone Cold Steve Austin), the 2017-2018 Tough Mudder X Champion, and holds multiple HYROX world records.\n\nSuffice to say, it isn\u2019t a secret that the 6 foot 2 inches tall, 205lb McIntyre who is capable of running sub-five minute mile and bench pressing 102kg/225lb ten times (NFL combine standard test) is a world class endurance athlete. Even CrossFit offered him a wildcard invite to the 2019 Reebok CrossFit Games to test how he stacked up against the fittest in the world \u2014 he placed 61st, not too shabby for someone who isn\u2019t dedicated solely to training for CrossFit.\n\nWe got the chance to talk with McIntyre about his training, his diet, his current goals, and more. The man has is not shy about his competitive nature and has the look, talk, and flair of a pro wrestler \u2014 big flowy blonde hair and an affinity for rose colored shades indoors. He is fully aware of the areas that his training and diet break the conventional norms but is equally as aware that it works for him (and his results back him up). In his own words:\n\n\u201cThis is frickin\u2019 sweet! I\u2019m getting paid to run in the mud, baby!\u201d\n\nCheck out the full interview with McIntyre below from the BarBend YouTube channel:\n\n## McIntyre\u2019s Origins In OCR\n\nBefore becoming a professional athlete, McIntyre worked as a fitness model, a personal trainer, and bodybuilder. When asked how he navigated his way to competitive obstacle course racing, he pretty much stumbled into it.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of like a crapshoot, dude. It was super random.\u201d\n\nMcIntyre first got into OCR in 2011 and said the decision was akin to someone fresh out of college trying to figure out what to do with their life. He attributes first getting into OCR after he found active.com \u2014 a site that informs people where there are athletic activities near them, both casual and competitive.\n\n*\u201cOne of my friends found a Spartan Race\u2026nobody really knew what those things were. People were going, but it wasn\u2019t really a sport. I did it and was like damn this is insane.\u201d*\n\nMcIntyre recognized that it was a \u201cbig, emerging time in the functional fitness world\u201d and decided to go full throttle in the pursuit of become one of the sport\u2019s best. It also served as a reason to prevent his parents from bringing him home to attend college.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m putting all poker chips down on this thing. My mom wanted to kill me. My dad was supportive. And look where we\u2019re at now.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/B9ray4WHyYu/\n\n## Training\n\nMcIntyre writes his own programming and will adjust it as needed depending on how his body feels. He believes that there are focal points training should highlight in order to improve intensity and distance over time:\n\n- Increase strength and position \u2014 progressive overload.\n\n- Increase speed and position \u2014 faster reps at higher resistance.\n\n- Increase endurance and position \u2014 add more volume.\n\n**His training structure each week includes at least one upper body intensity day, one lower body intensity day, and one track day.**\n\nMcIntyre trains in Boulder, CO for half the year (the other half is spent in Malibu, California). He has three to six athletes training with him at any given time and each have their own strengths. And he will incorporate some pretty unusual gambits to spice things up \u2014 such as a pull-up contest where the loser has to run around the neighborhood naked.\n\n\u201cI have to put the work in myself, but if i didn\u2019t have the support from my teammates, it\u2019d be hard to get the numbers and the places I want to be.\u201d\n\n### Cold Bar Technique For Grip Strength\n\nWhen it comes to improving his grip, McIntyre subscribes to the \u201ccold bar technique\u201d which involves\n\n**performing feats of athleticism and strength sans warming up**, such as lifting a 250lb stone. Some other examples are:\n\n- \u201cHe-Man challenge\u201d \u2014 performing 15 pull-ups cold with a 50lb weight around your waist.\n\n- 17 pull-ups on the fingerboard (fingers inside of grip holes).\n\n- 120 meter sandbag sprint in under 20 seconds.\n\n### Sleep\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not much of a sleeper.\u201d\n\nEven though McIntyre has a grueling training schedule, he doesn\u2019t require much sleep to perform at his best. He is able to routinely wake up very early \u2014 think 4am \u2014 regardless of how late his goes to bed, whether it\u2019s 8pm or midnight.\n\n## Diet\n\n\u201cI certainly track my calories. I\u2019m not super super dialed on what I eat. Meat, yogurt, and tons of sugar. Sugar\u2019s the shit, I love that stuff.\u201d\n\nMcIntyre certainly lives by his love of sugar. His normal intake is usually \u201c300g-500g per day.\u201d\n\n### Macro Breakdown\n\nMcIntyre said that he is actually able to eat more on rest days than he is on training days. He sketched out a rough estimate of his macros per day:\n\n- ~90g of fat\n\n- 400g-600g carbs\n\n- 180g-250g protein\n\nAdding up the high end of that macro estimate, it would put his daily intake at 4,210 calories, but he says his\n\n**daily average somewhere in the range of 4,500-5,500 calories. **Here is a list of the staple foods McIntyre\u2019s training diet consists of:\n\n- Steak\n\n- Chicken\n\n- Yogurt\n\n- Maple Syrup\n\n- Honey\n\n- Fruit\n\n- Bread\n\n- Pasta\n\n- Oatmeal\n\n- Sweet potatoes\n\n\u201cBeing a professional athlete, you have to dedicate yourself just as much towards eating as you do towards training.\u201d\n\n## Is there any food that you actively avoid?\n\n*\u201c Vegetables. I don\u2019t touch vegetables. They don\u2019t make sense. I can\u2019t find one reason to add them in there. I cannot find one fricken\u2019 reason. You just need to eat calories and vegetables are just a waste of time. What am I going to do with a bunch of spinach? It\u2019s not going to do anything. Broccoli neither. Let me introduce you to the monsters of world \u2014 you don\u2019t see them touch any vegetables. They just eat like pigs and they crush.\u201c*\n\nMcIntyre doesn\u2019t believe in keto, paleo, or any other special diet. His stance against vegetables came after a conversation with exercise physiologist and sports nutritionist Dr. John Ivey:\n\n*\u201cI sat down with the guy\u2026he was like I\u2019ve worked with some of the best athletes in the entire world \u2014 they drink Coca-Cola and eat Twinkies and they crush.\u201d*\n\nThe health aspects of a diet contained with so much sugar don\u2019t concern McIntyre in the slightest. He expects his autopsy to include the coroner having to pull globs of cholesterol out of his arteries.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to live the life of a healthy person. I\u2019m trying to live the life of a champion.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/B-pG0qlHwyj/\n\n## Future Goals\n\nWhen it comes to CrossFit, McIntyre knew he wanted to get the wildcard invite to the CrossFit Games well before he ultimately got it. He was making it known that he was going to go to the Games nearly a year in advance. His results and his training coincided with a lot of networking. His meals were often paired with phone call after phone call to make it known that he wanted that wildcard invite. He intends to make another appearance at the Games, but first plans to set a world record time for the hero WOD \u201cMurph\u201d on Saturday, May 23th as part of\n\n*The Murph Challenge* \u2014 *\u201cif I get 28:45, that will be 10 minutes ahead of the current world record.\u201d*\n\nThe \u201cMurph\u201d was named after fallen U.S. Navy Seal and Medal of Honor recipient LT. Michael P. Murphy. It consists of:\n\n*****while wearing a 20lb weighted vest:** **1 Mile Run** **100 Pull-Ups** **200 Push Ups** **300 Squats** **1 Mile Run**\n\n*The Murph Challenge *is also a fundraiser for the LT. Michael P. Murphy Memorial Scholarship Foundation. If you would like to donate to support the cause and McIntyre\u2019s \u201cMurph\u201d world record attempt, you can do so via Team RWB\u2019s fundraiser.\n\n*Feature image via Hunter McIntyre\u2019s Instagram page: @huntthesheriff*\n\n",

          "snippet": "At his cabin in Big Bear, California, Hunter McIntyre trains with some unconventional tools. The American world record holder for functional fitness race Hyrox chops logs, lifts stones and flips tyres. He sometimes throws an axe into a tree stump while perched on a unicycle (a pandemic hobby).\n\nAfter breaking the world record for CrossFit hero WOD Murph and easily beating the shit out of everybody (\u201cnot to be insulting\u201d) at the HYROX Invitational and Nationals in 2021, the champion variously of Obstacle Course Racing, Tough Mudder X and\n\n*Steve Austin\u2019s Broken Skull Challenge* wanted to try something new. He went head-on into training to run the fastest marathon over 200lb (90kg), got hurt and realised: \u201cI can\u2019t have one ass and ride two horses.\u201d This year \u2013 after the odd Spartan Race and 2022\u2019s HYROX World Championships \u2013 McIntyre plans to clear his slate of heavy, intense conditioning. Then that marathon is on.\n\nHow does McIntyre ride the two horses of strength and endurance but not half-ass either? \u201cJust periodisation, man.\u201d Alternating endurance blocks with strength, fully focusing on each in turn. He usually does his own programming, and that of his HAOS Training app, but he recently hired a coach because he\u2019s so busy he doesn\u2019t want to think. A \u201cgreat week\u201d for McIntyre, when he\u2019s not travelling, is six hours in the gym and 10 to 14 of cardio.\n\n*(Continued below)*\n\nMcIntyre splits his training time between Big Bear and Boulder, Colorado at the foot of the misleadingly named, near-vertical Flat Iron mountains. When he speaks to\n\n*MH*, earlier this year, he\u2019s gearing up for two hours atop \u201cMagnus the Mountain Slayer\u201d, a single-speed bike that builds \u201calmost unstoppable\u201d physical and mental capacity - because if McIntyre doesn\u2019t pedal, he falls off. In the gym, he\u2019s working through a back squat cycle: pick a weight you think you\u2019d be lucky to get ten reps with, then don\u2019t stop until you\u2019ve done 20.\n\nYou need an alter ego, says \u201cThe Sheriff\u201d, that comes out when necessary. He self-talks by relentlessly bad-mouthing himself, repeating only two or three words so he doesn\u2019t get distracted. At school in Connecticut, teachers said his only life path was taking pills for his ADD; he ran, wrestled, drank, got arrested for stupid stuff. After rehab \u2013 which included a job as logger, which filled out his sapling frame \u2013 he realised: to be worthy of people\u2019s time he had to do something worthy with his.\n\nMcIntyre got into bodybuilding, then modelling, but he\u2019s not a still picture guy. He\u2019s\n\n*animated*. Having never run farther than three miles, he rocked up to a half-marathon and won. It\u2019s a great part of the book he\u2019s writing. He\u2019s been off medication since 21.\n\nMH has a new alter ego: Hunter McIntyre.\n\n**57:34**\n\nMcIntyre\u2019s world record for HYROX: 1km SkiErg, 50m sled push, 50m sled pull, 80m burpee broad jumps, 1km row, 200m farmer\u2019s carry, 100m sandbag lunges and 100 wall balls - with a 1km run before each station\n\n**34:13**\n\nMcIntyre\u2019s world record for Murph: 1-mile run, 100 pull-ups, 200 press-ups, 300 air squats and another 1-mile run - all while wearing a 20lb weighted vest\n\n**.**\n\n## Hunter, Not a Gatherer\n\nMcIntyre\u2019s unconventional nutrition. Disclaimer:\n\n*MH* does not endorse avoiding veg.\n\n## First Thing\n\n\"I have Strong Coffee, my buddy\u2019s company: it\u2019s got collagen in it and it tastes really good. I have my own supplement company, BLDR, so I put my aminos in a cup every day. And I add about three tablespoons of honey.\"\n\n*Morning training (2 hours)*\n\n## All Day Long\n\n\"It's mostly sandwiches, steak and rice, tons of Honey Nut Cheerios and milk and more sugar on top of that.\"\n\n*Afternoon training (1-3 hours)*\n\n## At Night\n\n\"Lots of rice and meat, big steaks: sometimes I eat two or three a day. Last night, we had ramen noodles and sticky buns. And I'm still always under 10% body fat.\"\n\n## Almost Never...\n\n\"You can't pay me to eat vegetables\u2026 I've hung out with some super athletes and almost all of the best of them just rip calories. It doesn't matter if it comes from steak and rice, chicken, Twinkies... Superheroes aren\u2019t made of vegetables, they're made of calories.\"\n\n## How to Win at Hyrox\n\nThe record holder\u2019s pro tips for newbies:\n\n- \"Just get used to running an hour straight. It\u2019s an endurance event. I hold the world record, and I'm fucking running my ass off the whole time.\"\n\n- \"It's almost all legs. You should be doing tons of squats, wall balls, box step-ups, lunges. You should be doing that about three days a week.\"\n\n- \"Test one of the workouts, like 100 wall balls for time: if it takes you five minutes, you should be doing something on your legs that's five minutes straight. It\u2019s not rocket science.\"\n\nJamie Millar is a freelance journalist and regular Men\u2019s Health contributor, writing about style, grooming, fitness and culture.

          "snippet": "**Off season ** **HYROX** ** Training **\n\nAs it\u2019s just been HYROX World Championships, we\u2019ve now got over 4 months until the next UK HYROX event. This means we have time to work on our weaknesses, alongside getting stronger and fitter.\n\nYou may already think you know your weaknesses - you may feel like you need to get better at running, or if you got stronger your sled push would improve, but there are more elements of fitness you may not realise have an impact on your overall performance. Now is the time to work on them, and below is how I\u2019d suggest splitting up the next few months of training and what to focus on:\n\nI\u2019d recommend splitting your training up into 6-8 week blocks.\n\nIf you have 12+ weeks before your next HYROX event, this is a good time to focus on getting stronger, getting fitter and moving well. Below are the main focuses of this block:\n\n- Building a solid base of fitness (running & ergs)\n\n- Building overall strength\n\n- Progressing all elements of fitness, which are listed below:\n\n\n\nMuscular Strength: The amount of physical force your muscles can put out, how much weight you can lift.\n\n\n\nMuscular Endurance: The ability for a muscle group to engage repetitively over an extended period of time, also known as the measure of a muscle group\u2019s \u201cgas tank\u201d.\n\n\n\nCardiovascular Endurance: The ability to operate for extended periods with an elevated heart rate.\n\n\n\nBody Fat Composition: The relation between the amount of body fat you have to your total body mass.\n\n\n\nBalance and Coordination: Balance is defined as the ability to remain upright and demonstrate control over your body, coordination is the ability to control members of your body with efficiency and dexterity.\n\n\n\nSpeed or Quickness: The ability to move all or part of the body as quickly as possible.\n\n\n\nFlexibility: The ability to stretch muscles without pulling or tearing them.\n\n\n\nAgility: The ability to perform rapid whole-body movements with change of velocity or direction in response to a stimulus.\n\n\n\nPower: The amount of strength a person is able to use during a movement, together with the speed of the motion.\n\n- Reaction time: The speed at which one can respond to a stimulus.\n\nIf you\u2019re 12-6 weeks out from your HYROX event your focuses should be:\n\n- Start to add in HYROX specific exercises into your training.\n\n- Progress to heavier weights that you\u2019d use on the day of HYROX.\n\n- Add in at least 1 \u201cHYROX\u201d session per week.\n\n- Start to focus your training around building muscular endurance and speed with running/ergs.\n\nIn the 6 - 1 weeks out from your Hyrox event your main focuses should be:\n\n- Get really specific with HYROX exercises & quantities - this should mimic race day conditions with regards to exercise selection, weight & reps.\n\n- Replicate race day scenarios.\n\n- Start to focus on technique & tactics for each movement, and practice these. If you\u2019re competing in doubles, this is an ideal time to get some training sessions in together & practice transitions, and the order in which you\u2019ll perform the exercises.\n\n- Incorporate more \u201cHYROX\u201d sessions within your training.\n\n- Practice race day nutrition, find what works well for you & trail this within your training sessions.\n\nIn the week prior to HYROX, this is time to start deloading from training. This means don\u2019t train as heavy/hard or as frequently as we have been doing, and I\u2019d recommend incorporating a couple of rest days in as we approach race day. Ensure nutrition is on point, our recovery & sleep is optimal and we have a bulletproof plan of how race day is going to go. By this point, all the hard work is done and it\u2019s time to go and smash your race!\n\n**Nutrition whilst off season training:**\n\nOur main focus should be to maintain a healthy high protein diet that\u2019s varied which also includes enough calories to fuel our bodies. To do this, I would recommend trying to ensure 80% of our food is coming from whole foods, and the other 20% is made up however you\u2019d like.\n\nProtein - aim to consume 1.7-2.2g of protein per KG of bodyweight, per day. Split this across all meals, sources of protein are things such as chicken, steak, eggs, fish, cheese etc.\n\nWe want to prioritise consuming carbohydrates prior to training, as this is going to fuel our body. Ideally we want something easily digestible before we train, and something that won\u2019t sit too heavy on our stomach, such as bagels, porridge oats, rice, squares bar, bananas etc.\n\nIt\u2019s important to include Healthy fats into your diet that are unprocessed as these are great for optimal health and hormone production. Animal fats and nuts are a great option for this.\n\n\n\nShare:\n\n#WOTW: Jake Dearden HYROX Master Trainer Series\n\nJonny Pain on 'The Perfect Program'\n\n",

          "snippet": "HYROX, the endurance-based hybrid race, challenges athletes on nearly every level: aerobic and anaerobic fitness, physical strength, and mental resilience. If you want to succeed, preparation is absolutely vital.\n\nComprised of alternating 1km runs and functional workout stations, its format is what sets it apart from similar sports. For this reason, HYROX training can be tailored specifically to the unique demands of the event.\n\nAnd, once you\u2019ve completed your first few events, you can continue tweaking your training, making it even more specific to you, amplifying your strengths and improving your weaknesses.\n\nHaving come top in my age category in both doubles and singles HYROX events this season, I will be traveling to Nice this summer to compete in the HYROX World Championships.\n\nIn the coming months, as the event draws closer, I will adjust my training intensity and begin to focus on specific goals. But at the minute, I am focusing on all areas: strength, aerobic fitness, and resilience.\n\nBelow is an example of my typical weekly training split. Hopefully it provides an insight into the importance of balance. Super-intensive sessions six times a week is not the best way to train. In fact, it\u2019s probably even detrimental.\n\nHYROX is intense and therefore places the body under a lot of strain. This means it\u2019s important to include gentler sessions in your training split. Working hard in your training, but recovering harder, is how you progress. Also, as there\u2019s a lot of repetitive movement, it\u2019s important to keep the volume at a reasonable level, particularly when starting out.\n\n## Monday:\n\nAM: 5k progression run\n\nPM: Strength\n\n## Tuesday:\n\nAM: Strength workout\n\nPM: HYROX session (40-60 minute engine-based workout incorporating HYROX exercises)\n\n## Wednesday:\n\nRow intervals (e.g., 10 x 500m with 2 mins rest in between sets)\n\n## Thursday:\n\nAM: 10k progression run\n\nPM: Strength workout\n\n## Friday:\n\nRest or active recovery: easy 15k exercise bike (zone 2)\n\n## Saturday:\n\nStrength workout + Saturday team sweat\n\n## Sunday:\n\nHYROX session: 50-minute AMRAP with running and exercises.\n\nWhile this might seem like a lot, there are a few things to note when looking at this training program.\n\n- Some of these sessions take no more than 30 minutes. I rarely, almost never, spend three hours in the gym in one day.\n\n- I have a very flexible schedule, meaning I have the option of breaking my training up into morning and evening sessions. For many people this isn\u2019t doable, and that\u2019s ok.\n\n- I have spent years working to get to this position. This should not be looked at as what you \u201chave to do\u201d in order to compete in HYROX.\n\n- This training plan is specific to me and my current goals. Everyone is different and should base their training around their abilities, goals, and lifestyle.\n\n## Take home message\n\nWhen preparing for an endurance-based hybrid event like HYROX, you must look at all areas of your training. Run plenty to improve your fitness, lift some weights to increase your strength, and include plenty of HYROX-specific workouts to practice the specific movements.\n\nA training plan that covers all these things will support your HYROX goals, but also help you to stay functionally fit and strong. Remember: work hard, but more importantly, work smart. And as always, have fun throughout the process.\n\nREAD THESE NEXT:\n\n## Everything You Need To Know About HYROX\n\nYour complete guide to HYROX events....\n\n## 8 Things I Wish I Knew Before My First HYROX Event\n\nIt's more than just a race....\n\n## Best & Worst HYROX Stations, Voted By You\n\nIt was never gonna end well for burpees....\n\n",

With every swing of the axe and every stride across rugged terrain, McIntyre has forged a path of resilience and triumph, shaping not only his physique but also his character.\n\nYou might recognize Hunter McIntyre\u2019s name or curly golden locks from his time as an obstacle course racing champion, appearances on Steve Austin\u2019s Broken Skull Challenge, CBS\u2019s Million Dollar Mile, or as the Murph Challenge world record holder. However, his foundation and story began a few decades ago and he has evolved through hard work, dedication, and determination as he has pushed both physical and mental limits.\n\n### \u201cTreehab\u201d Times For Hunter\n\nMcIntyre\u2019s introduction to the world of manual labor came unexpectedly, as part of his substance abuse rehab after high school. Assigned the arduous tasks of a lumberjack, he found himself confronting the raw elements of nature with little more than his rock-solid attitude and the tools of his trade\u2014axes, chainsaws, and cables.\n\n\u201cThe necessity of the job turned me from a boy into a man, physically, mentally, and emotionally,\u201d Hunter recalls. The challenges he faced among the towering trees instilled in him a deep sense of resilience and resourcefulness, laying the foundation for the indomitable spirit that would later propel him to greatness.\n\nAs McIntyre toiled amidst the whispering pines and swaying branches, he discovered a profound connection to the land and a newfound appreciation for the strength of his own body. Each swing of the axe and each tug of the cable became a testament to his growing prowess and an affirmation of his ability to overcome adversity. It was there, amid the rugged beauty of the wilderness, that McIntyre underwent a transformation\u2014shedding the weight of his past and emerging stronger than ever, both physically and mentally.\n\n### From CrossFit To HYROX\n\nBut McIntyre\u2019s journey was far from over. Fueled by a desire to test his limits and explore new horizons, he attempted an obstacle course race and was hooked. He eventually earned the title of Obstacle Course Racing World Champion six times. Hunter has also been a CrossFit competitor and holds the record for the Murph workout. The Murph consists of a 1-mile run, 100 pull-ups, 200 push-ups, 300 bodyweight squats, and then another 1-mile run, all while wearing a 20-pound vest. Hunter completed that workout in the blazing time of 34 minutes and 13 seconds.\n\nThen, Hunter heard about a new up-and-coming competition called HYROX\u2014a unique blend of fitness and endurance racing that would push him to his very limits. The word \u201cHYROX\u201d doesn\u2019t stand for anything, but is a mashup of the words \u201chybrid\u201d and \u201crockstar\u201d\u2014by all accounts created on a drunken night between the founding team somewhere in Hamburg, Germany!\n\n\u201cI just had to try it,\u201d Hunter said excitedly. The allure of HYROX lay in its simplicity and challenges, its fusion of running and lifting challenging participants to excel in both realms. McIntyre was captivated by the sheer intensity of the sport, its blend of physical exertion and mental fortitude offering him a new frontier to conquer.\n\nHis first foray into the world of HYROX was nothing short of spectacular. Defying the odds to most everyone except himself, McIntyre emerged victorious, defeating the reigning champion and announcing his arrival on the global stage. It was a moment of triumph, a validation of his years of hard work and winning attitude, and a glimpse of the greatness ahead.\n\n### Honing His HYROX Skills\n\nYet McIntyre knew that continued success in HYROX would not come easy. With its grueling demands, the sport required a level of commitment that few could match. Undeterred, McIntyre embarked on a rigorous training regimen, honing his skills and pushing his body to new heights of strength and endurance. His training schedule was a meticulously crafted symphony of sweat and all-out persistence, with each grueling session carefully calibrated to maximize his performance on race day.\n\nAt the heart of Hunter McIntyre\u2019s training philosophy lay a simple yet profound principle\u2014consistency. Whether swinging an axe or pounding the trails, he understood that success was built not on grand gestures or fleeting moments of brilliance, but on the steady accumulation of maximum effort. Day in and day out, he pushed himself to the limit, refusing to settle for anything less than his best.\n\nHowever, his journey was not without its challenges. As he pursued his dreams on the HYROX circuit, he encountered both physical and mental obstacles\u2014setbacks that threatened to derail his progress and shake his confidence. Yet through it all, he remained steadfast in his overall approach, drawing strength from the lessons of his past and the unwavering support of those who believed in him from the start.\n\n### The Trail Ahead\n\nToday, McIntyre stands as a beacon of inspiration and hope, a living testament to the power of resilience and the unyielding pursuit of excellence. From his humble beginnings as a lumberjack to his meteoric rise to HYROX glory, he has defied the odds and proven that with enough heart and personal drive, anything is possible.\n\nAs McIntyre looks to the future, his gaze is fixed firmly on the horizon, his sights set on new challenges and new triumphs waiting to be conquered. With each step he takes, he carries with him the lessons of his past and the dreams of his future, a reminder that no obstacle is too great, no goal too lofty, for those who dare to chase their dreams with unwavering devotion.\n\nIn the end, Hunter McIntyre\u2019s journey is not just a story of athletic achievement, but a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the boundless potential that lies within each and every one of us. As he continues to push the boundaries of what is possible, he serves as a reminder that with enough courage, determination, and perseverance, anything is possible\u2014both on the racecourse and in life.\n\n### By The Numbers: Hunter\u2019s Lumberjack Workout\n\n\u25a0 10 minutes of wood chopping\n\n\u25a0 5 minutes of heavy stump moving, including pushing and pulling stumps\n\n\u25a0 5 rounds of max-effort tire slam intervals with 30 seconds of work and 30 seconds of rest\n\n\u25a0 3 to 5 200-foot steep hill climbs carrying a 50- to 100-pound log\n\n## Think You\u2019re Ready To Race HYROX?\n\nHere\u2019s the lowdown of a HYROX race in the order of events performed.

But, for the three-time Hyrox World Champion and six-time OCR World Champion, aka \u2018the Sheriff\u2019, it works.\n\nWith McIntyre relaxing following a silver-medal finish at the Hyrox World Championships,\n\n*MH* called the 36-year-old at home in Malibu to find out what\u2019s on the menu, and how he fuels his way to success.\n\n*Men's Health*: What did you have for dinner last night?\n\n*Men's Health*: What did you have for dinner last night?\n\n**Hunter McIntyre:** It\u2019s embarrassing. My buddy and I were playing Magic: The Gathering [a strategy card game] and I only had time to eat a ton of nuts and granola. I get so competitive; we were playing for three hours and I just forgot to eat.\n\n*MH*: **Do you usually follow a strict diet?**\n\n*MH*:\n\n**HM: **I have Tupperware containers full of chicken and stuff, but because the Hyrox season just ended, I have a couple of weeks to chill before I ramp up my strength training again. My diet is periodised, so I just got off a week of drinking as much as I could and eating ice cream.\n\n*MH*: **What\u2019s your go-to drink?**\n\n*MH*:\n\n**HM: **I love a double Maker\u2019s Mark [whisky] on the rocks. And I can down two to four bottles of wine and not even make a dent. [Editor\u2019s note: *MH* does not advise trying this at home.] I never get drunk because honestly, my metabolism is too fast. I could be sitting here, having a conversation with you for hours, just taking a sip and having a good time. And I love a pi\u00f1a colada if I\u2019m somewhere tropical.\n\n*MH*: **You\u2019re not a fan of people sharing their carefully curated meals online. Why?**\n\n*MH*:\n\n**HM: **Because you\u2019ve got this guy with this perfect plate of all the colours of vegetables and a cute little piece of sushi, and in reality, you\u2019re spending 50% to 70% of your time chewing greens that give you zero calorific benefit. It\u2019s bullshit. You\u2019re gonna run into me in a competition or in the gym and I\u2019m gonna smash you because I\u2019ve been eating sugar, creatine and steak.\n\n*MH*: **You said that all pro athletes are surrounded by sugar. Is that true?**\n\n*MH*:\n\n**HM: **I\u2019m buff as shit, and I eat as much sugar as I like. Seventy per cent of high-performance athletes\u2019 diets are carbs, and 50% of those carbs are sugars. Half of the supplements that I take are sugar-based. Real ones don\u2019t need to post to get your attention. I don\u2019t care if you value me as a nutritionist \u2013 I\u2019d rather you see me as a world champ.\n\n*MH*: **You\u2019re not a vegetables guy. Why\u2019s that?**\n\n*MH*:\n\n**HM: **Vegetables are girlfriend food [Hunter\u2019s view, not *MH*\u2019s]. You get a bunch of guys coming to my training camps and not one buys vegetables. I tried being vegan twice, but I\u2019ve never found any data that links eating tons of vegetables to tons of performance. If you read about the Kenyans, they\u2019re eating goat meat and drinking booze made from honey.\n\n*MH*: **So you\u2019re more focused on calories?**\n\n*MH*:\n\n**HM: **It\u2019s just kind of an add/ subtract game: calories in, calories out. There are no calories in vegetables but there are in chicken, rice, steak. It\u2019s all about the building blocks. A piece of chicken has protein, a cup of rice has carbohydrates, and that\u2019s really it.\n\n*MH*: **How do you adjust your diet for the Hyrox season?**\n\n*MH*:\n\n**HM: **As I get further into the season, I start cutting out the rib-eye steak. You go towards the leaner cut of meat, or you go to fish and chicken. It\u2019s as simple as that. If you come to my house and you think you\u2019re going to beat my ass after eating an acai bowl or having a smoothie, you\u2019re dead. You\u2019re dead.\n\n## Hunter McIntyre's Diet\n\nA hybrid athlete needs calories above all else, as McIntyre\u2019s daily essentials prove.\n\n## Morning jolt\n\n\u2018I have Strong Coffee. It\u2019s got collagen in it and it tastes really good.\u2019\n\n## Supplements\n\n\u2018I have my own supplements company, Bldr, so I put my aminos in a cup every day with three tablespoons of honey.\u2019\n\n## Cereal\n\n\u2018Tons of Honey Nut Cheerios and milk and more sugar on top of that.

He\u2019s not shy of getting through multiple sessions, which is how he achieved so much success as an individual CrossFit athlete - he outworked his competition.\n\nUnlike most athletes, though, he doesn\u2019t follow a set routine. He doesn\u2019t overthink things or get too bogged down by statistics, he just goes by feel and adapts his workouts accordingly.\n\n\u2026\n\n**Typical Rich Froning Workouts**\n\nUsually, Froning will start the day with a cardio-based workout at about 8:30am.\n\nFor example, he might do the following session:\n\n1400m Run\n\n100 Cal Bike Erg\n\n1400m Run\n\n100 Cal Bike Erg\n\nHe\u2019ll then move on to his second session of the day later in the morning, which usually revolves around some Olympic lifting.\nFroning does a lot of squats, deadlifts and power cleans, which is how he maintains such a strong base.\n\nAfter lunch, he trains again from 2:30pm until 3pm, and then might fit one final session in at around 4pm if his body feels good.\n\nThese afternoon workouts tend to be more CrossFit specific. An example session is below.\n2-4-6-8-10 sets of muscle-ups\n\n4-8-12-16-20 sets of burpees\n\n10-20-30-40-50 sets of wall balls\n\nImportantly, Froning makes sure he sleeps around 10 hours each night so he can maintain such a high intensity and volume throughout the day.",

Froning retired from individual competition in 2014 and then became a 4-time team champion with CrossFit Mayhem Freedom. On the eve of this year's Games, his squad is primed to capture a fifth world championship. Froning recently took part in an AMA through our app to discuss his workouts and training, extending his career, and the insights he gains from his WHOOP data. Here are several of the highlights.\n\n## Training, STRAIN & Workouts\n\n**Question: How many hours/sessions do you train daily? And how do you prevent injury?** **Rich Froning:** Usually a 3-hour session in the morning and 2 hours in the afternoon. The offseason is a lot of technique to stay healthy. **Q: Do you track individual pieces of your workout sessions or the entirety?** **Rich:** Depends on how lazy I am that day with starting and stopping the activity on my WHOOP. **Q: What is your average daily ** **strain** **?** **Rich:** I average around 15 strain during the season. **Q: Have you changed your approach to training (e.g. schedule, volume, intensity) after gaining access to WHOOP data?** **Rich:** Not a ton during the season, but offseason yes. **Q: Are burpees the most complete exercise, if you only had to choose one?** **Rich:** Thruster is better. **Q: Would you rather squat with Mat Fraser or do arms with Arnold Schwarzenegger?** **Rich:** Arms with Arnold. **Q: I follow ** **Mayhem competitor programming** ** and just wanted to ask, do you guys really do that much work every day?** **Rich:** Yes, haha. Love having you as part of the family!\n\n## Sleep, Recovery & HRV\n\n**Q: What is the one piece of data from your WHOOP that you value the most?** **Rich:** Sleep. **Q: How many hours of sleep do you get on average?** **Rich:** 7-8 hours. **Q: What is your favorite recovery protocol?** **Rich:** Sleep. Cold plunge. **Q: What's the weirdest thing you do for recovery that seems to work for you?** **Rich:** Swim. **Q: What does an ** **active recovery** ** day look like for you? Do you ever take complete rest days with no physical activity (or as little as humanly possible)?** **Rich:** I feel better when I move every day. Thursdays are usually a machine or mountain bike for an hour (weather permitting) and swim. Sundays are just one session, usually a machine (ski, bike, row). Those would be my \"active recovery\" days. **Q: How, if at all, has WHOOP data changed your approach to recovery?** **Rich:** During season not much, other than that I try to optimize those things that help me recover. Offseason I pay a lot more close attention to my recovery. I'm getting older and if I want tot extend my career, off-season is where I'm going to do it. **Q: What do you do when you feel great but your ** **recovery** ** is reflecting otherwise? Do you keep to your programmed training or alter it?** **Rich:** It's a little bit of a mix of both. **Q: Can you tell us your protocol for getting over patella tendinitis?** **Rich:** Tempo back squats, 3-4 sets, 8-12 reps. 4 down, 3 up. Heavy. **Q: I know this question is a regularly asked one, but what is your recommendation for ** **increasing one's HRV** **? What works best for you?** **Rich:** Sleep, eating enough, and cold tub are my 3 go-to's. Massage seems to help bring up my HRV as well.\n\n## Supplements & Gear\n\n**Q: Are there any supplements you recommend to help with your sleep or training?** **Rich:** I take CBD and melatonin. **Q: What do you think about CBD for performance? Any experience about that?** **Rich:** I take it for sleep. **Q: Why do you like to wear your shoes loose when you train?** **Rich:** As long as it's not rope climbs, it's more comfortable.\n\n## The CrossFit Games\n\n**Q: What was your best moment competing as an individual at the Games?** **Rich:** When the last one was over, haha. Actually I have too many to list. I have a lot of great memories from the tennis stadium. **Q: At what point will you have CrossFitted longer than you played baseball?** **Rich:** I think I've passed it. **Q: I'm interested in your perspective on the topic of longevity in CrossFit in general. What's the best way to extend your career?** **Rich:** Move well and check your ego.\n\n## Life Outside the Gym\n\n**Q: What are the foundational activities that you do when you start your day?** **Rich:** Reading the Bible and coffee. **Q: What are your favorite hobbies, or ways to relax and unwind?** **Rich:** Hanging with the kids, mountain biking, and hunting. **Q: Which one of your children do you believe will participate in CrossFit in the future?** **Rich:** I don't want to push any of them to compete, but they all love coming to the barn and \"working out.\" I love hanging out with them there and us having fun. **Q: I'm weeks out from having my first baby, my life is already hectic. How do you balance your career, training, and being a good father?** **Rich:** Some days I do it very well and other days I'm bad at It. Every day is a new day. **Learn More:** *Comparing Rich Froning\u2019s Heart Rate, Strain & More in Individual vs. Team CrossFit Games Quarterfinals Workouts*\n\n",

He is a 3x Team USA CrossFit member and CrossFit Games Champion. A Pediatric Cancer Advocate after his daughter was diagnosed with Leukemia in 2016, host of the Effort Over Everything Podcast, and BJJ Purple Belt.\n\nIG: Jason Khalipa (@jasonkhalipa) \u2022 Instagram photos and videos\n\nPodcast: EOE Podcast | NCFIT\n\nWebsite: https://www.nc.fit/\n\nPhilanthropy: https://avaskitchen.org/\n\nOpening this up now to get a rolling start. Coach will be here tomorrow morning to start answering, but if you\u2019ve got a question for him, fire away.\n\nI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll tackle AMQAP. As Many Questions As Possible. I\u2019m sorry, that was too easy and I couldn\u2019t resist. But yeah, questions, go for it.\n\nIs asking how his training is arranged stupid? Like how much is simply doing different WOD\u2019s that have things he\u2019s working towards vs having pre programmed training focused around building certain lifts / muscle groups.\n\nAlways been curious what the higher level CrossFit people do for training.\n\n@Chris_Colucci Will be ready to go! Thank you for the opportunity\n\n@wanna_be not stupid at all, depends on what I am focused on at the time. Currently I am preparing for a Legends Competition at the end of the month so I have added a little more complexity to my training (muscle ups, HSPU, etc). Normally I follow our NCFIT workouts, specifically our NCX track. I typically do this workout daily and add in am cardio and/or BJJ daily. When I was competing professionally I broke my day into three sections. AM would typically be cardio, mid day would be more CrossFit with couplets triplets and for time workouts, the evening would be for stamina building on gymnastic type movements (10 min emom of 10 strict pull ups) for example.\n\nThanks for the detailed reply man and glad you\u2019re doing this!\n\nThanks for taking the time to do this.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite picture taken of you in any competition and why? Please post or link to the photo. Thank you.\n\nProbably this one, this event was called the Burden run and this movement was called a pig flip, It was a tough event that I won and flipping this down the field well secured It for me. Hope all is well!\n\nProbably a hard question to answer because everybody is different, but how different would the workouts be for high level crossfit vs the typical box gym WOD people? When I have watched the high level people, it seems a lot more lifting, compared to when I have done WODs at a box gym, which was more cardio based.\n\nI don\u2019t remember if I caught it on your podcast or somewhere else, but you talked about a \u201cSweat Once a Day\u201d approach to training. Is there any more to that philosophy or is it really just about driving the mindset of \u2018show up, go hard, come back for more later.\u2019\n\nAlso, separate question: What\u2019s something every lifter could benefit from learning/borrowing/stealing from CrossFit, either as a general approach, specific method or technique, etc.?\n\nGood question, depends on the gym you go to and the program they are following. On social media you\u2019ll see a lot of athletes share lifts because they are easy to film and cool to watch. .They may not film all the cardio/workouts they do. At NCFIT we have two workout tracks in our gyms NCmetcon has some days you\u2019d do a longer \u201ccardio\u201d style workout while our NCX class will have strength and then a workout daily. So really depends on the gym you go to, the program they have, and the potential bias of the coaches towards cardio/strength.\n\nI\u2019ve never heard you really discuss food, aside from BBQ. What\u2019s your typical nutrition look like?\n\nThe sweat once a day (increase your heart rate and move through a range of motion) is for my children. That is the requirement in our house, they can do whatever they want (bike, swim, sports, trampoline, whatever) but It has to get done. Same should go for adults as well.\n\nThe idea of a coach, community, and a clock are special. The clock provides a sense of urgency that helps get more work done in less time. I think incorporating that into your workouts, at least every now and then and pushing the pace is a key factor. The coach component for most lifters definitely would help also, specifically those that lift on their own and have never had someone else review or provide insight on their movement\n\nWith all this training, how do you manage your recovery?\n\nhaha, thats a great question. Its an area I need to do better about sharing for sure. We have a new nutrition challenge coming up thats called Hands on Nutrition Challenge at NCFIT. Pretty simple theory but It involves looking at your quantity and also quality of your food. I am not super strict on my diet but generally eat Real food in quantities that support my activity level and desired physical look. I avoid excessive sugar and when looking to lean down reduce my carb intake.\n\nhere are a few other resources. https://www.nc.fit/edit/nutrition\n\nKey for me is to listen to my body. I train BJJ 3x a week and do our NCFIT workouts daily. I also typically do early AM cardio and/or Ruck walks to start the day. If I feel super fatigued ill try and reduce the volume. However, doing nothing isnt something I really ever do. Ill at a minimum go for a long walk, I find that movement fuels me mentally and physically and is something I do daily\n\nDo you have an all time favorite WOD at all?\n\n",

This data helps him identify factors that positively or negatively impact his recovery and adjust his training accordingly. **Cold Therapy:**He incorporates cold therapy into his routine, taking ice-cold showers first thing in the morning. He also has a cold plunge coming to his house. **Massage:**Froning utilizes massage to alleviate muscle soreness and promote recovery. **Sleep:**Prioritizing sleep is essential for Froning's recovery.",

To be someone who can lift crazy weight, and hold their own in the fitness world aswell. First with these Hyroxes, then with another half-marathon attempt. Here is my exact training routine to run a sub-60 doubles Hyrox while preserving my ability to bench 200KG by the end of the year. Enjoy.\n\n\u2026\n\n{ts:6} course  of  a  10e  training  block,  I'm \n going  to  show  you  how  someone  who  can\n{ts:10} \n pause  bench  180  kg  and  sit  [music]  at \n\n{ts:12} over  100  kilos  body  weight  can  smash  a \n sub60  doubles  high  rocks.  That's  crazy.\n{ts:17} \n That's  crazy  to  say  it.  It  is  crazy  to\n{ts:19} say  it.  Anyway,  so  my  training  block  for \n my  first  men's  doubles  high  rocks  at\n{ts:24} \n [music]  the  end  of  March  started  2  weeks \n\n{ts:25} ago.  For  the  first  half  of  these  10 \n weeks,  it's  going  to  be  heavily  based\n{ts:29} \n around  running.  Because  when  you  look  at\n\n\u2026\n\n{ts:99} or  sub  70  doubles  high  rocks.  The  second \n run  is  a  threshold  run.  So  these  are\n{ts:104} \n multiple  rounds  of  about  a  kilometer  in \n\n{ts:106} distance.  Done  at  a  pace  that  doesn't \n quite  leave  me  gasping  [music]  for  air,\n{ts:110} \n but  is  at  a  certain  pace  for  a  certain\n\n\u2026\n\n{ts:139} reducing  that  pace  slightly  [music]  to \n get  used  to  the  idea  of  recovering  my\n{ts:143} \n aerobic  capacity  while  I'm  still  moving, \n\n{ts:146} while  I'm  still  running.  So,  last \n night's  session  was  four  [music]  rounds\n{ts:149} \n of  6  minutes,  ran  at  a  440  to  445  per\n\n\u2026\n\n{ts:203} walking  lunges,  hammering  myself  with \n burpee  broad  jumps.  There  will  be  a  time\n{ts:207} \n and  a  place  for  these  sessions  as  the \n\n{ts:208} block  progresses.

          "snippet": "Rich Froning trains and eats like a CrossFit freak. His work ethic is one of a kind and some nutritionists even say they wouldn\u2019t recommend his diet to an elite athlete.\n\nBut his methods clearly work for him. Between 2011 and 2015 he was unbeatable, winning four Fittest Man on Earth titles in a row, a feat only recently surpassed my Mat Fraser.\n\nFroning has gone on to even more success as a member of CrossFit Mayhem in the team division and is still in incredible shape at the age of 34.\n\nWhile his methods in the gym and his patterns of eating are pretty difficult to replicate, they\u2019re certainly something to marvel at. Here\u2019s a look at how Rich Froning eats and trains.\n\n**Rich Froning Doesn\u2019t Stinge On Volume **\n\nFroning trains for most of the day. He\u2019s not shy of getting through multiple sessions, which is how he achieved so much success as an individual CrossFit athlete - he outworked his competition.\n\nUnlike most athletes, though, he doesn\u2019t follow a set routine. He doesn\u2019t overthink things or get too bogged down by statistics, he just goes by feel and adapts his workouts accordingly.\n\n\u201cI work out anywhere from two to five times a day, but I don\u2019t walk into the gym with a schedule,\u201d Froning said in the past. \u201cI just make it up as I go, listening to my body and doing what I think I need to do.\u201d\n\nIt takes a huge amount of confidence and experience to be able to take such a laid-back approach. Most athletes would struggle to train without a clear plan that\u2019s leading towards a goal.\n\n**Typical Rich Froning Workouts**\n\nUsually, Froning will start the day with a cardio-based workout at about 8:30am.\n\nFor example, he might do the following session:\n\n1400m Run\n\n100 Cal Bike Erg\n\n1400m Run\n\n100 Cal Bike Erg\n\nHe\u2019ll then move on to his second session of the day later in the morning, which usually revolves around some Olympic lifting.\n\nFroning does a lot of squats, deadlifts and power cleans, which is how he maintains such a strong base.\n\nAfter lunch, he trains again from 2:30pm until 3pm, and then might fit one final session in at around 4pm if his body feels good.\n\nThese afternoon workouts tend to be more CrossFit specific. An example session is below.\n\n2-4-6-8-10 sets of muscle-ups\n\n4-8-12-16-20 sets of burpees\n\n10-20-30-40-50 sets of wall balls\n\nImportantly, Froning makes sure he sleeps around 10 hours each night so he can maintain such a high intensity and volume throughout the day.\n\n**Rich Froning\u2019s Diet**\n\nFroning has to fuel a lot, but interestingly he doesn\u2019t eat much throughout the day. He\u2019s even been known to fast for 16 hours and only eat properly at the end of his training day.\n\nMore recently, after working with a nutritionist, he\u2019s started incorporating a bigger meal in the middle of the day so he has more energy to train off.\n\nEach meal aims to include 45g of protein, 25g of fat and at least 100g of carbohydrates so that he can maintain energy levels throughout each workout.\n\nFroning will often skip breakfast, but he\u2019ll generally have protein shakes throughout the day to keep some calorie intake up. A lunchtime meal might include another shake plus meatloaf and sweet potatoes.\n\nHe\u2019ll then get a major meal in the evening. This might be a large steak or grilled chicken with potatoes and vegetables.\n\nIf he\u2019s still hungry, Froning continues to listen to his body and makes sure he keeps fueling by eating peanut butter with apple slices or some cereal later at night.\n\nIf it sounds like a crazy schedule, that\u2019s because it is. But Froning has found a way to make it work for several years, and nobody can argue with his results.\n\n\n\nShare:\n\n5 Reasons To Eat Manuka Honey For Better Health\n\nThere's Finally Proof You Can Cut Body Fat Through Strength Training Alone\n\n",

          "snippet": "# The Engine and the Edge: Dan Churchill on cooking, competing, and the power of fuel\n\nYou might know Dan Churchill as The Healthy Chef on TikTok or from\n\n*MasterChef Australia* Season 5 \u2014 but his journey started long before his time in the spotlight. With a Master\u2019s in Exercise Science, Dan began his career helping athletes optimize their performance through movement and nutrition. That hands-on experience\u2014combined with his love of cooking, which started at age 11\u2014eventually led him to self-publish his first cookbook and swap the gym floor for the kitchen line.\n\nNow, Dan works with athletes on how to fuel smarter for better workouts and stronger results. He writes\n\n*Legendary*, a newsletter sharing science-backed, actionable insights on nutrition, performance, and recovery, and he's currently chasing his own elite goal: a sub-60 Hyrox.\n\n*The Hybrid Letter* sat down with Dan to talk about his journey from rugby to hybrid, the surprising gaps in how athletes understand nutrition, the power of timing your meals, and what it really takes to balance performance, recovery, and life.\n\n*This interview has been edited for length and clarity.*\n\nThe Hybrid Letter: Why did you start cooking and finding a love for being in the kitchen? Dan Churchill:After high school, I did my master\u2019s in Exercise Science and became a strength and conditioning coach. As part of that work, I got exposed to applied nutrition.\n\nI was working in Australia with rugby players and Australian Rules Football athletes. One of my responsibilities was to help them improve ground force reaction time by about 5%\u2014crucial for speed. Because of my degree, I\u2019d also sit in on the nutrition consultations between players and the team nutritionist.\n\nTHL: What did you notice with these athletes that got you even more interested in the fuel-to-perform piece? DC:Back then\u2014about 12 years ago\u2014the athletes didn\u2019t really understand what the nutritionists were telling them. I\u2019d been cooking at home since I was 11 and always loved the delicious side of food, maybe even more than the nutritional side. But through my degree, I learned how to bridge the gap between home cooking and applied nutrition for the average person.\n\nI\u2019d watch this nutritionist talk in numbers, and the players were just lost. I understood what she was trying to say, so I created recipes that met her guidelines and printed them out for the athletes. That way, they could follow something simple and still hit all their nutritional targets.\n\nThe team ended up outperforming expectations. That experience led me to self-publish a cookbook, and eventually, I wanted to go deeper into the food world. I started in the dish pit, worked my way up from line cook to sous chef, then head chef, and finally executive chef. During the day, I was coaching; at night, I was in the kitchen.\n\nTHL: How did you get into hybrid training?Hybrid\u2019s been around way longer than people realize. It\u2019s just training across multiple fitness modalities. The decathlon and triathlon are historical examples.\n\nDC:\n\nI grew up playing rugby, and our training was intense\u2014weights, sprints, long efforts, skills. I loved it. Honestly, I loved the training even more than the game. It gave me a solid foundation in programming, which became part of my role as a strength and conditioning coach. I took that philosophy and applied it to the way I now train for Hyrox. It\u2019s the same methodology, just refined.\n\nTHL: Now you write a newsletter called\n\nLegendary that shares scientifically-backed, actionable insights on nutrition and training. What inspired that?I\u2019m not into entertainment-for-entertainment\u2019s-sake content. I wanted to create something that adds real value. It\u2019s hard to explore deeper ideas on platforms like TikTok or Instagram. But newsletters and YouTube? That\u2019s where you can go deep.\n\nDC:\n\nSo the idea was to take everything I\u2019ve learned\u2014and continue to learn\u2014and make it digestible. No pun intended. I want people to apply it to their own lives. The newsletter isn\u2019t about building a big list; it\u2019s for people who genuinely want to learn. I share recipes, programs, and tools that help them do just that.\n\nTHL: Can you share a bit about your philosophy when it comes to training this way and nutrition?\n\nDC:Hyrox is amazing because it motivates people to get off the couch and train for something. It\u2019s inspiring to see all levels of fitness out there competing.\n\nThe first step is knowing where you are. If you\u2019re at the elite level, you\u2019re chasing that extra 1%. But if you\u2019re newer, the priority is building a strong foundation through proper fueling. Most of my audience is either elite or slightly above average and looking to get better, so I focus a lot on meal timing and overall intake.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges is that many people simply aren\u2019t eating enough to support the demands of hybrid training. You're doing more volume\u2014running, strength work, or both\u2014often four to twelve sessions a week. To recover properly, your body needs sufficient fuel, and nutrition is a major part of that equation.\n\nFirst principle: make sure you're meeting your energy needs. Second: understand how to structure your meals around your workouts\u2014what macros to emphasize and when. It can be tough to shift that mindset, but you're not training just for one event. You're training to be healthy over the long term. That includes supporting your immune system, which takes a hit during periods of intense physical activity.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just macros. Micronutrients are what I call the fifth macronutrient. They matter just as much.\n\nTHL: In a recent newsletter, you touched on how sleep plays into all this. Can you talk more about that?\n\nDC:Everyone knows sleep is important\u2014but there\u2019s a big difference between time in bed and actual sleep. And then there\u2019s restorative sleep.\n\nSleep plays a huge role. Studies show how it impacts hormones, brain neurotransmitters, and cognitive function. I try to get people to focus on REM and deep sleep\u2014the two restorative stages. REM happens at the back end of the cycle, deep sleep at the front.\n\nWorking with Whoop, I\u2019ve seen how bad sleep affects performance. My Zone 2 heart rate goes up. When I had three months of poor sleep, my hormones were all over the place. You feel it. If you\u2019re not sleeping well after tough workouts, you\u2019re not recovering. You\u2019re missing the hormonal benefits of training.\n\nSleep, nutrition, and hydration\u2014those are my big three.\n\nTHL: Is there anything in your nutrition that helps with sleep? DC:Timing is everything. Eating too close to bed affects sleep. Red meat, for example, takes a long time to digest. So if you eat something fatty right before bed, your body is still working even if your eyes are shut.\n\nTry to finish eating at least two hours before sleep. If you\u2019re on a high-protein diet\u2014as most of us are\u2014make sure it\u2019s spaced out. Dense protein and high-fat meals too close to bedtime can delay deep sleep.\n\nCarbs can help with sleep, but not all carbs. Complex carbs are good; sweet, insulin-spiking ones aren\u2019t. It\u2019s about finding balance.\n\nTHL: You have a YouTube series called\n\nSub 60 . Where did that goal come from?I\u2019ve never seen myself as an elite athlete. I wasn\u2019t born with top-end speed, but I\u2019ve got a great engine\u2014my heart rate and recovery are excellent.\n\nDC:\n\nSpeed, though? Not my strength. This journey is as much for me as it is for anyone watching. I want people to see that an average guy, who wasn\u2019t a state champion or naturally gifted, can still chase down a goal if he works hard enough.\n\nI want that sub-60. Just to see that \u201c59.\u201d Not many people hit that time, but I believe I can. I started at 1:11, got to 1:08, and I think I\u2019m on track for 1:05 in New York. It might take another year or two, but I\u2019m all in.\n\nLeadville last year taught me the value of preparation. It\u2019s about putting in the reps and improving 1% every day. Work can be hectic\u2014this is my personal challenge, and I love it, even if I\u2019m not naturally fast.\n\nTHL: Any challenges along the way that surprised you? DC:I remember watching my first Elite 15 race. Before I did my first Hyrox, I knew it wouldn\u2019t be easy\u2014but I was the fit guy. I could row, wall ball, do almost everything else and usually finish near the top.\n\nBut I underestimated the running. It\u2019s 70% of the event, and I didn\u2019t fully factor in how much it would affect fatigue. Going from a run into burpee broad jumps is a different beast. Even though I\u2019m solid at burpees, that transition was brutal.\n\nIt\u2019s all about learning to ride out Zone 4 and get back into rhythm.\n\nTHL: Have you changed your nutrition to help hit your\n\nSub 60 goal? DC:Definitely. First, I had to increase my intake\u2014just doing too much not to. I started taking fish oil regularly for omega-3s. Used to be I\u2019d just eat a banana before training\u2014maybe 30 grams of carbs\u2014but I didn\u2019t account for how much I was burning, even in Zone 2.\n\nNow I\u2019ve added more carbs, like Complex G1 from BPN. I also upped my Vitamin D\u2014specifically D3, which is key. I get it through AG1. I started thinking about deficiencies, reducing fat around workouts for quicker energy, and dialing in how I recover and fuel.\n\nYou can follow Dan on Instagram and YouTube or subscribe to his newsletter, Legendary.\n\n**New turf to debut at Hyrox World Championships**\n\nOne of the most variable components in a Hyrox race is the sled push and pull. At some races, the sleds seem to glide over the carpet. At others, the sleds feel like they are glued down.\n\nHyrox has taken a major step to try to standardize the experience by announcing \"HYROX Perform Turf.\" According to Hyrox, it \"delivers consistent, durable, and optimized sled push and pull conditions\u2014matching the resistance of our previous setup while leveling up performance.\" Gyms will also be able to purchase the turf so that athletes can train under race conditions.\n\nWhile conventional wisdom says that it is easier to push a sled over turf than a carpet, Hyrox claims the experience is unchanged. But since the resistance on the carpets varied, that promise does not provide much insight for athletes. Hyrox used turf for its outdoor event in New York City in 2024, and it resulted in extremely slow sled push times and extremely fast sled pull times.\n\nWhat will the impact of the new turf be? We'll find out in June in Chicago.\n\n**Athlete of the Week: Jaci Caceres**\n\n**Name:** Jaci Caceres **Age:** 45 **Hometown:** Fort Worth, TX\n\n**When did you start hybrid training?** I started hybrid training because I\u2019ve never been the type to settle into just one style of fitness. I\u2019ve been an athlete my whole life\u2014played collegiate soccer, competed in bodybuilding, and always chased performance at the highest level across different arenas. But I wanted more. I wanted to be strong, fast, powerful, and conditioned all at once. I didn\u2019t want to sacrifice endurance for strength or vice versa.\n\nHybrid training forces me to be adaptable. It makes me embrace discomfort and show up ready for anything. It\u2019s the ultimate test\u2014not just of physical ability but of mindset and discipline. It\u2019s about proving that you don\u2019t have to fit into one box. You can lift heavy, move fast, endure pain, and come out stronger on the other side. I want to thrive in my arena!\n\n**Favorite race to date?** Hyrox Dallas 2024. I\u2019ve done a lot of races, but that one stands out. I ran mixed doubles with the amazing coach and Hyrox vet Talon Smith. We\u2019d only practiced together once, but we set a goal, went after it, and crushed it. We qualified for World\u2019s 2025, which made it even sweeter.\n\n**Do you have a race goal?** I do! One of my main goals is to go sub-70 in Women\u2019s Pro by Chicago 2025\u2014or hit sub-60 in Mixed Doubles in Chicago.\n\n**Favorite station?** The sled station. It brings together strength, power, and mental grit. I love the challenge of pushing heavy weight, but even more, I love the moment when my legs are burning and doubt creeps in\u2014that\u2019s when I dig deep and keep moving. It\u2019s a mental battle. And once I finish the sleds, it\u2019s time to settle into the rhythm of the race.\n\n**Least favorite station?** Wall balls. They\u2019re the final test of endurance and mental toughness, and they always hit when I\u2019m completely gassed. Being on the shorter side makes them even tougher\u2014I have to fight for every rep while my legs and shoulders are screaming. It\u2019s the point in the race that either makes or breaks me.\n\n**Things you wish you knew when you started racing?** I wish I\u2019d known how time-consuming Hyrox training really is\u2014especially when it comes to running and recovery. It\u2019s not just about being strong; you\u2019ve got to log serious mileage to build the endurance to hold pace between stations. Balancing strength, conditioning, and recovery takes a lot of intention.\n\nI\u2019ve also learned how important pacing, mobility work, and structured training are. And maybe the biggest personal lesson has been about sleep. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve struggled with while juggling family life and work, but I\u2019ve come to understand how directly it impacts my recovery, performance, and energy on race day.\n\n",

          "snippet": "It tells you everything you need to know about Jake Dearden that he ran his first 100km ultramarathon aged just 19. The rising British star of the world\u2019s fastest-growing fitness event has never been afraid of a challenge. Still only 26, Dearden already has an impressive number of accolades under his running belt. During lockdown, while the rest of us were enjoying our leisurely lunchtime walks, he completed seven marathons in seven days and followed that up by running 10 marathons in five days in 2022.\n\nNext, he added a 100-mile race and multiple other ultra-distance events to his CV. Then came Hyrox. Dearden only started competing after he was peer-pressured into it by his friends. But after becoming one of the sport\u2019s early adopters, he quickly achieved a world record for his age group, with a not-too-shabby time of 57 minutes and nine seconds. Since then, he\u2019s completed 11 Hyrox races in 48 hours \u2013 a reward for recovering from two slipped discs \u2013 and has become a world champion, winning the Men\u2019s Doubles title at the 2024 Hyrox World Championships in Nice, France, with partner Marc Dean. This year, he set himself the goal of competing solo at the big one, Hyrox\u2019s Elite 15 World Championships; at the time of writing, Dearden has just qualified for his spot.\n\nIn his mid-twenties, he\u2019s still a relative pup compared with the thirty-somethings he\u2019s often pitted against, but he\u2019s determined to sled push his way to the very top of the sport. Speaking to\n\n*Men\u2019s Health*, the Hyrox Master Trainer shares the all-in approach he\u2019s taking to accomplish his latest and, arguably, greatest challenge.\n\n**What is Hyrox?** The world\u2019s largest indoor fitness race, Hyrox combines eight 1km runs with eight functional fitness stations, including sled pushes and pulls, sandbag lunges and wall balls. The race format remains consistent across the globe, with a World Championships held at the end of each race season.\n\n*Men\u2019s Health*: How did you find your way into Hyrox?\n\n**Jake Dearden:** Hyrox didn\u2019t appeal to me at the start, but I got talked into it, ended up going to one without really training for it and did well in my age group. I thought, \u2018If I put my mind to this, I might do okay,\u2019 so I did a 12-week block where I specifically trained for Hyrox. I came back and got the world record for my age group in the open category.\n\n*MH:* **How has your training evolved since then?**\n\n**JD:** For a long time, my main focus was running. There were a lot of professional runners or close-to-professional runners, triathletes and so on, who were coming into the sport and doing really well. So I thought, \u2018I need to get better at running.\u2019 It\u2019s half of the sport, after all. So I put in a massive training block to improve my running and my aerobic capacity. But I neglected the strength work a little bit, so I\u2019ve moved to focus on that and get everything aligned. I\u2019ve looked at all my weaknesses and found experts in those fields, and asked them questions so they can help me turn my weaknesses into strengths.\n\n**Want to follow the exact training plan Hyrox champion Jake Dearden used to prepare for the World Championships?

I did it locally first, so it was just strength coaches, movement coaches, running coaches and the best physios I know. I\u2019ve now had the opportunity to speak to more pro athletes. Recently, I got to spend time with Tom Evans, one of the best ultrarunners in the world, and grabbed a couple of tips on how to prepare for an event. He told me it was all about what you do in the month prior and how that affects your race.\n\n*MH*: Did you take anything else from Tom or athletes like him?\n\n**JD:** It\u2019s looking at the elite attitude of these people and how, even if I thought I was giving everything, I definitely wasn\u2019t. These people are just so much more advanced \u2013 in terms of the preparation and analysis and never doing anything that\u2019s just random. Everything is done to benefit their training so they can move forwards and win.\n\n*MH*: When you\u2019re speaking to experts in disparate fields, is it easy to translate that advice for such a mixed bag of a sport like Hyrox?\n\n**JD:** The reason I\u2019m going to all these different experts is because Hyrox hasn\u2019t been around for very long. Even though there are Hyrox coaches out there, there are no Hyrox experts. You\u2019ve got to look to other sports, where they\u2019ve been doing it 40, 50 years. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s trial and error.\n\n*MH*: What advice would you give to people looking to train for Hyrox?\n\n**JD:** The best piece of advice I can give is train as much as you can recover from. My job at the moment is to train and become the best at Hyrox. If you\u2019re looking at my training and thinking, \u2018I need to do that amount,\u2019 but you\u2019ve got a full-time job, you\u2019ve got family and you\u2019re only sleeping four hours a night because you\u2019ve got little kids, it\u2019s just not going to work.\n\n*MH*: **Are you a big fan of mixed-modal sessions or do you prefer to train for strength and cardio separately?**\n\n**JD:** I\u2019m quite boring with my training. I like to do the same movements week in, week out so I can see progress. I usually split up my running and my strength until about five to six weeks out from a race. Then I might swap out a couple of sessions so I\u2019m doing some weights and then going straight into running, to practise running under fatigue. That prepares my body. But I think working on your running separately is going to be much more beneficial than trying to do everything fatigued all the time.\n\n*MH*: Some athletes will come to Hyrox from a strength background, others are from an endurance background. Should you lean into your strength or work on your weaknesses?\n\n**JD:** I always look at the [workout station] and the run as one exercise, so if you\u2019re a strength athlete and you\u2019re amazing at the sled push, look at your sled push and your running time after as one exercise. You might be really good at the sled push, but then your running might drop off a cliff. If you\u2019re a stronger athlete and you\u2019re not very good at running, you need to get better at it. You can\u2019t neglect anything.\n\n*MH*: Do you prioritise any particular part of a Hyrox race?\n\n**JD:** Think about a race in order of importance, so starting off with your SkiErg [the first workout station] \u2013 that\u2019s the most important exercise. If your heart rate skyrockets at the ski and you struggle, that\u2019s going to fatigue you for the rest of the race. But if you get fatigued at the burpees [the fourth station], you\u2019ve had a good first half of the race. You need to focus on these things in order of importance, but don\u2019t neglect any of them. If your wall balls really suffer, work on them.\n\n*MH*: What\u2019s your optimal race-day strategy?\n\n**JD:** It probably starts the day before. I\u2019m a big fan of carbing up. Some people feel sluggish, but I think it benefits me. I like to carb up, I like to stay hydrated and I like to get a good night\u2019s sleep. Because my events are always at night, I like to go to the venue early and check out the track. If I\u2019m doing an Elite 15 competition, we\u2019ll have a briefing, so we\u2019ll go through the rules and get to see the course. Then I like to go home, have a nap, eat, have another nap and then get up. That\u2019s when I switch on and get ready. I\u2019ll go to the venue, mobilise for 20 minutes and then go out for a little jog.\n\n*MH*: What\u2019s always in your bag on race day?\n\n**JD:** Water and always \u2013 it sounds sad \u2013 a protein shake for afterwards. I\u2019m already thinking about the next race, so if I can get an advantage on recovery, then I\u2019m going to do it. Then I just have spare kit to get changed into afterwards. After a race we\u2019ll go out and celebrate. Every race is like a celebration of all your hard work and training, so I always like to go out. My celebrations are probably a bit different. A lot of people, they\u2019ll go out and they\u2019ll have drinks and stuff like that. Mine\u2019s just going out for a nice meal.\n\n*MH*: Do you take any other supplements?\n\n**JD:** I\u2019m a big fan of caffeine. I love caffeine. If I\u2019m training, I only have it before midday, just because it affects your sleep. If it\u2019s competition, it doesn\u2019t matter because the competition comes first. I take creatine daily and I\u2019m also a big fan of electrolytes. I\u2019ve been testing out bicarbonate of soda recently, too. There are various brands that have started creating a gel that it sits in, so it bypasses the stomach and that\u2019s meant to be a lactate buffer. Lactic acid is built up in your system when you\u2019re training hard and when your muscles go anaerobic; bicarb neutralises that and brings down your pH levels. I\u2019ve been trying that recently and I think there\u2019s a benefit.\n\n*MH*: What\u2019s the biggest mistake you\u2019ve made in a race? Is there anything that haunts you?\n\n**JD:** When I slipped two discs in my back in a race \u2013 that definitely haunts me. I\u2019m still hurting from that now; I\u2019ve still got back issues. That was just from neglecting my mobility and not looking after my body. Before that, I was into a lot of ultramarathons and I never let my body recover properly, so I was stupidly running miles and miles and miles, and then doing fitness events for fun. So just not prioritising recovery is probably the thing that I regret most.\n\n*MH*: Do you ever get race-day nerves and how do you deal with them?\n\n**JD:** Yes, I do get race-day nerves and I\u2019ve suffered with them quite a bit in the lead-up to races. My race-day nerves were over a long period, so it might be two weeks before an event. I used to shut down and my girlfriend would always think I was in a mood because she\u2019d say something and I\u2019d just not reply. It was because, in my head, I\u2019m thinking about the race, about what I\u2019m going to do and I was a bit too obsessed with it.\n\nI spoke to someone about it and the advice they gave me was that the race is going to happen no matter what, so there\u2019s no point thinking about it two weeks beforehand. You might as well spend that time enjoying yourself and doing things that you want to do in the lead-up. Then, when it\u2019s the actual race, deal with it. The race only happens once, but you can live it so many times beforehand. So that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to do and it has really helped. I also think if you\u2019ve trained as well as you should have, then the nerves shouldn\u2019t be there, because you\u2019ve done everything you can. And if you are honest with yourself and you know that, you shouldn\u2019t be nervous.\n\nAndrew Tracey\n\nWith almost 18 years in the health and fitness space as a personal trainer, nutritionist, breath coach and writer, Andrew has spent nearly half of his life exploring how to help people improve their bodies and minds.\n\nAs our fitness editor he prides himself on keeping Men\u2019s Health at the forefront of reliable, relatable and credible fitness information, whether that\u2019s through writing and testing thousands of workouts each year, taking deep dives into the science behind muscle building and fat loss or exploring the psychology of performance and recovery.\n\nWhilst constantly updating his knowledge base with seminars and courses, Andrew is a lover of the practical as much as the theory and regularly puts his training to the test tackling everything from Crossfit and strongman competitions, to ultra marathons, to multiple 24 hour workout stints and (extremely unofficial) world record attempts.\n\nYou can find Andrew on Instagram at @theandrew.tracey, or simply hold up a sign for \u2018free pizza\u2019 and wait for him to appear.\n\n",

You should feel comfortable and able to chat without effort.\n\n**What it Does:**\n\n\u2026\n\n**Zone 2** **:** ** Aerobic Base & Fat Burning (65\u201380% VO** **\u2082** ** Max)**\n\nThe foundation of endurance training. You can speak in short sentences during this zone but not hold an easy conversation for long.\n\n**What it Does:**\n\n\u2026\n\n- Boosts recovery and stress resilience.\n\n**Tips:**\n\nZone 2 is where endurance is made, arguably the most important zone for measurable improvements. Aim for steady, long runs (45\u201360+ minutes) to fully stimulate fat metabolism and mitochondrial development.\n\n**Zone 3: ** **The \u201cGrey \u201d Zone \u2013 Race Pace Familiarisation (80\u201385% VO** **\u2082** ** Max)**\nZone 3 sits between easy aerobic work and hard threshold training. It offers fewer benefits than other zones because it isn\u2019t low enough to improve endurance or high enough to significantly raise your VO\u2082 max.\n\n**What it Does (When Used Right):**\n\n- Helps you get used to holding a sustained race pace (such as for 10K or half-marathon distances).\n\n- Improves breathing efficiency under moderate, sustained effort.\n\n- Sharpens pacing, cadence, and mental focus for race-day conditions.\n**Caution:**\n\nMany athletes accidentally spend too much time in this zone without meaning to, leading to unnecessary fatigue without the fitness payoff. Use Zone 3 sparingly for tempo runs or race-pace practice only.\n\n**Zone 4: ** **Threshold & Lactate Buffering (85\u201390% VO** **\u2082** ** Max)**\n\n\u2026\n\n**Tips:**\n\nZone 4 is intense, ideal for structured intervals or sustained tempo blocks. Taxing on the body, so prioritise recovery after these sessions to allow proper adaptation.\n\n**Zone 5: ** **Maximal Effort & VO** **\u2082** ** Max Development (90\u2013100% VO** **\u2082** ** Max)**\nYour top-end intensity. Used to increase your VO\u2082 max and expand your heart\u2019s ability to deliver oxygen-rich blood at maximum demand.\n\n**What it Does:**\n\n- Raises the ceiling of your aerobic capacity (VO\u2082 max).\n\n- Improves stroke volume (the amount of blood the heart pumps per beat).\n\n- Enhances breathing capacity and oxygen delivery efficiency.\n\n- Supports all other zones by increasing overall performance potential.\n**Tips:**\n\nUse Zone 5 for short, high-intensity intervals (30 sec\u20133 min) with full recovery in between. Limit to 1\u20132 sessions per week to avoid burnout or overtraining.\n\n**Why Training Zones Matter**\n\nUsing training zones properly ensures every workout has a purpose, whether that\u2019s building endurance, burning fat, improving race pace, or raising your aerobic ceiling. Without this structure, you risk training in a way that wears you out without delivering results.",

          "snippet": "My 12 Weeks includes the first 24 running workouts Coach Hinshaw programmed for Rich Froning in Nov 2014. The goal was to improve his endurance and, more specifically, to improve his 1-mile personal best time. At the program's start on Nov 14, 2014, Rich had a 1-mile personal best of 6 minutes. On Feb 3, 2015, at the program's end, Rich ran a 5:41 mile for a 19 second personal best improvement while his strength was hitting personal bests.\n\nPersonalized workouts with training targets adapts to your progress to maximize performance gain\n\nBonus: Exact step-by-step workout instructions and interval paces that Rich received and followed\n\nRich Froning was dubbed the Fittest Man in History after winning four back-to-back individual CrossFit Games championships. When Rich retired from individual competition after the 2014 season, he continued his reign by captaining his affiliate\u2019s team, CrossFit Mayhem Freedom, to five Affiliate Cup championships.\n\n* 4x Individual Champion of the CrossFit Games\n\n* 5x Team Champion of the CrossFit Games Affiliate Cup\n\n* Owner of CrossFit Mayhem\n\n* Owner of Mayhem Athlete program\n\n* Owner of Froning & Friends Podcast\n\nIt is important for you to understand that high-intensity training will develop your ability to deliver solid performances up to 2-3 minutes. However, any inefficiencies within your aerobic energy system will begin restricting performances as you extend beyond 3-minutes. The primary limiting factor is the ability to move and absorb oxygen. Yes, speed is still critical to success. However, to build capacity, nothing is more important than your ability to utilize oxygen.\n\nThe success of any training program is dependent on your workout intensity. My workouts have prescribed pacing intensities for every interval distance. This is how athletes develop a range of gears, intensity is controlled, internal pace setting learned, work capacity is increased, and performance gains are measured. Specialists' focus is on developing resistance to fatigue for their specific intensity. In contrast, soccer players must develop their resistance to fatigue for a wide range of intensities. The effectiveness of any training program must value the athletes' available exercise time. The efficiency of any training program must target specific adaptations to maximize performance gains. However, athletes are often uncertain which adaptations to prioritize with their available training time.\n\nI use the formula from Pete Riegel to calculate the rate of slowing or fatigue factor between 400m (speed) and 1-mile (endurance). An athlete\u2019s ability to resist fatigue is determined by the rate at which your average speed decreases with distance and time. The 400m distance is used because it's an anaerobic event and the 1-mile distance is used because it's an aerobic event. It is the relationship between these two distances that defines your specific level of aerobic fitness. For reference, anaerobically and aerobically balanced non-running specialists (or CrossFit athletes) typically have a fatigue factor of 21-22% between 400m and 1-mile.\n\nDo you need more low intensity, aerobic, endurance training or more high intensity, anaerobic, speed training?\n\nAs a result, I have developed specific targets that derive from a variation of the below formula from Pete Riegel.

Sometimes, the card has restrictions and will be declined if the transaction is out of ordinary or suspicious. You need to call your credit card company to have the restrictions removed and and try to purchase again.\n\nYes and No. This program is designed for CrossFit coaches, trainers, and athletes of all levels. No prior experience with endurance coaching and training is required to participate. However, you do need to be in good health and should always seek clearance with a doctor before starting any exercise activity.\n\nDeclines can happen for a variety of reasons. When a charge is submitted to the customer\u2019s bank, they have automated systems that determine whether or not to accept the charge. These systems take various signals into account, such as your customer\u2019s spending habits, account balance, and card information like the expiration date and CVC.\n\nSince these signals are constantly changing, a previously successful card might be declined in the future. Even if all of the card information is correct, and you previously had a successful payment, a future charge can still be declined by a bank\u2019s overzealous fraud systems.\n\nMost often when we see Credit Card errors it is a result of one of two things.\n\nOur merchant service provider recommends the following:\n\n\u201cIf all of the card information seems correct, it is best to have the customer contact his or her bank, inquire for more information, and ask for future charges to be accepted.\u201d\n\nWe currently only have half marathon program included in the membership, marathon program should be available soon!\n\nGetting you the results is our top priority. Since all of our programs have a minimum of 3 months in duration, we are asking a minimum of 3 months commitment! Depending on your starting situation, first results can be expected after 2 to 3 months of consistent training and proper recovery.\n\nNot at this time. What is unique about the training system is it personalizes your pacing based on your fatigue factor, so we can provide an effective and affordable solution to help you achieve your goal. This system is what he uses to get his athletes ready for the games.\n\nCurrently the program is programmed in running only. However, we do have advice on how to translate the pacing into different modalities.\n\nOur system automatically bills our subscribers depending on their billing cycle. If by any chance the charge fails, our system automatically retries after one day. If our system fails again, it will automatically retry after 3 days. After 3 failed attempts, your account will be closed due to failed payment.\n\nWe offer a 20% off group discount for a group of 5 or more. Please send all of the group members' emails and names when they are ready to sign up to info@aerobiccapacity.com.\n\nTo get quick answers on technical questions, you can find them at https://site.metron.io/support. You are a paying customer, so you can utilize the intra-platform email for a follow-up answer. Access support via the top right message icon on the homepage after you log in.\n\nAerobic Capacity Training System is a subscription service with 3 different commitments:\n\nWe do have ability to pause your membership. You will be able to pause anytime up to 6 weeks via Manage Subscription menu option. Feel free to reach out to us if you need to extend beyond that period.\n\nWe are evaluating your progress on a weekly basis. The programmed workouts must be completed within a week period to move forward to the following week. The Aerobic Capacity program is a weekly progression that must be followed to maximize the results.\n\nThis program is designed to be combined with your existing CrossFit training. There are 2 weekly workouts that have been proven to develop substantial performance gains in the everyday athlete up to the CrossFit Games Champion. By default, you will be enrolled into \"Running: Develop Your Engine & Stamina\" to start. It\u2019s designed to build up your resistance to fatigue and provides personalized run pacing goals after baseline runs are inputted. Once you have the foundation, you can use the add on, \"General Endurance and General Speed\", to build up the volume (be able to run longer).\n\nHere are the download links\n\niOS - https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metron-fitness/id1225833555\n\nAndroid - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.metron.metron&hl=en_US\n\nChris uses the same assessment and programming method for every athlete he coaches. It should be regarded that while Chris has had enormous success with CrossFit Games athletes, he has had the same success with other athlete types throughout his 30+ years of experience.\n\nAll workouts in our system will be personalized based on your latest performance testing data. This is why we built the training system -\n\n**To bring his meticulously crafted methodology to the masses.**\n\nNone of the elite or recreational athletes have experienced any reduction in their max lifts. In fact, every athlete has continued to set new personal records. In many cases, those PR's occur on the same day a workout is performed. For example, Rich Froning, after winning the CrossFit Games 4x, set PR's in his vertical jump, back squat, deadlift and clean during his first 16 weeks of programming. Another example, Camille Leblanc-Bazinet started working with Chris in June 2013. Almost one year after winning the 2014 CrossFit Games, Camille performed a 6800m track workout; 3 hours later she hit a personal record in her snatch at 200lbs. Lastly, Mat Fraser ran 3x(3x600m) in 2:15 with 40-second rest between reps and 4 minutes rest between rounds; 3 hours later he hit a personal record with his clean at 375lbs. Three months later, Mat won his first of five CrossFit Games while working with Chris.\n\n",

Froning includes protein in every meal and snack to keep his muscles fueled and recovering.\nFor added support, MTN OPS Magnum Protein delivers 23g of protein per serving, supporting muscle building and recovery. **Carbohydrates:**His carbohydrate intake ranges from 200 to 500 grams per day, depending on his training volume. He distinguishes between \"healthy\" and \"high GI carbs,\" prioritizing complex carbohydrates like sweet potatoes, brown rice, oatmeal, whole-wheat bread, whole-wheat pasta, and fruit.\n\n\u2026\n\n**Morning:**Froning starts his day with black coffee. **Post-Morning Workout:**After his morning workout, he consumes a shake made with Advocare lean body protein, 400 to 500 grams of berries (like raspberries or blackberries), almond milk, and PB2 powdered peanut butter. **Lunch:**Lunch typically consists of a pre-made meal prepared by a local chef, such as meatloaf with sweet potatoes, grilled barbecue chicken, or buffalo chicken mac.\nThese meals are designed to meet his specific macro and calorie requirements. **Afternoon Snack:**Before his afternoon training session, Froning consumes 40 to 50 grams of carbs and 20 to 30 grams of protein. **Dinner:**Dinner is a family affair, with both Froning and his wife, Hillary, contributing to the meal.\n\n\u2026\n\n**Protein:**Including protein in every meal and snack.

His approach is unapologetically old-school and contrarian.\n\nMcIntyre's three foundational principles of training progression:\n1. **Increase strength and position** \u2014 progressive overload with heavier loads.\n2. **Increase speed and position** \u2014 faster reps at higher resistance.\n3. **Increase endurance and position** \u2014 add more volume over time.\n\n*(Source: BarBend interview, 2023)*\n\nHe writes his own programming and has done so for most of his career, though he has periodically hired coaches when his schedule becomes too busy: \"I recently hired a coach because I'm so busy I don't want to think\" (*Men's Health UK, 2022*). He also programs for his HAOS Training app, which serves athletes across all Hyrox tiers.\n\nWhat makes McIntyre unique is his **hybrid lumberjack-athlete identity.** His foundation was literally built chopping trees during a substance-abuse rehab program after high school: \"The necessity of the job turned me from a boy into a man, physically, mentally, and emotionally\" (*Hook and Barrel*). He still incorporates wood chopping, stone lifting, and tire flipping into his training regimen.\n\nHe has stated: \"Just get used to running an hour straight. It's an endurance event. I hold the world record, and I'm fucking running my ass off the whole time\" (*Men's Health UK*). He believes Hyrox is \"almost all legs\" and recommends heavy squatting, wall balls, box step-ups, and lunges at least three days per week.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Weekly Training Structure\n\nMcIntyre describes a \"great week\" (when not traveling) as **six hours in the gym and 10\u201314 hours of cardio** (*Men's Health UK, 2022*). His HAOS HYROX PRO program prescribes:\n\n| Parameter | Details |\n|---|---|\n| **Training days/week** | 6 |\n| **Sessions per day** | 1\u20132 |\n| **Session duration** | 45\u2013180 minutes |\n| **Weekly time commitment** | 5\u201310 hours (program); up to 16\u201320 hours (his personal training) |\n| **Cycle structure** | 3 weeks intensity build \u2192 1 week recovery/deload |\n| **Endurance sessions** | Can last up to 3 hours |\n\n**Sample HAOS PRO Weekly Split:**\n\n| Day | Focus |\n|---|---|\n| Monday | Heavy Strength + Short Conditioning (deadlift variations, pull-up progressions, 20-minute EMOM) |\n| Tuesday | Running Focus + Accessories (interval running, sled work, core strengthening) |\n| Wednesday | Full Body Power (Olympic lift variations, plyometric training, conditioning circuit) |\n| Thursday | Hyrox Simulation (race-specific workout, transition practice, time trials) |\n| Friday | Strength Endurance (high-rep strength work, muscular endurance, fatigue management) |\n| Saturday | Long Conditioning (extended aerobic work, movement quality, recovery focus) |\n\n*(Source: HAOS Training / hyroxtrainingplans.com)*\n\nHis personal training always includes **at least one upper body intensity day, one lower body intensity day, and one dedicated track day** every week (*BarBend interview*). He splits training between Boulder, CO (altitude training near the Flat Irons) and Malibu/Big Bear, CA.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Session Design Patterns\n\nMcIntyre favors **EMOMs, AMRAPs, and interval-based formats** for conditioning work. He combines these with traditional heavy lifting.\n\n**Documented workout examples:**\n\n**Hyrox Simulation Workout (filmed in NYC, 2025):**\n- 18-minute EMOM: Sled push + TRX rows, alternating between 2-minute hard efforts with 1-minute rest or continuous flow.\n- Then: 5 rounds of 20-calorie row + 20 burpees, aiming for each round to fit within ~1 minute of work.\n\n*(Source: \"HYROX Training with 3X World Champion Hunter McIntyre in NYC,\" YouTube, 2025)*\n\n**Training Camp Workout (Episode 6, YouTube, 2024):**\n- 20\u201325 minute AMRAP: 25 TRX rows \u2192 sled pull \u2192 30 shoulder presses, with 10\u201315 minute active recovery on the bike between sets. Athletes choose shoulder press weight where they can hit 20 unbroken.\n\n**The \"Lumberjack Workout\" (Hook and Barrel):**\n- 10 minutes of wood chopping\n- 5 minutes of heavy stump moving (pushing and pulling stumps)\n- 5 rounds of max-effort tire slam intervals: 30 seconds work / 30 seconds rest\n- 3\u20135 \u00d7 200-foot steep hill climbs carrying a 50\u2013100 lb log\n\n**The 20-Rep Squat Protocol:**\nMcIntyre sells an 8-week \"20 Rep Squat Strength Guide\" through HAOS Training, described as \"formulated by Hunter McIntyre on his mission to win world titles.\" The protocol: pick a weight you think you'd be lucky to get 10 reps with, then don't stop until you've done 20 (*Men's Health UK*). This full-body plan is designed to \"boost your strength and stamina through a 20-rep cycle.\"\n\n**Cold Bar Technique for Grip Strength:**\nMcIntyre performs feats of athleticism and strength **without warming up** \u2014 a deliberately shocking stimulus. Examples include:\n- \"He-Man Challenge\": 15 pull-ups cold with a 50 lb weight vest\n- 17 pull-ups on a fingerboard (fingers in grip holes)\n- 120-meter sandbag sprint in under 20 seconds\n\n*(Source: BarBend interview)*\n\n**Cycling Endurance:**\nHe rides \"Magnus the Mountain Slayer,\" a single-speed bike, for 2+ hours. Because it's single-speed, if he stops pedaling he falls off, building what he calls \"almost unstoppable physical and mental capacity\" (*Men's Health UK*).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Hyrox-Specific Preparation\n\nMcIntyre approaches Hyrox station training through his HAOS PRO program which includes specific skill blocks for:\n- **Sled push/pull mechanics** \u2014 drilled on Tuesday sessions with interval-based sled work\n- **Burpee broad jump efficiency** \u2014 practiced for movement economy\n- **Wall ball technique** \u2014 endurance protocols (e.g., 100 wall balls for time, then building 5-minute leg endurance sets to match)\n- **Sandbag carry variations** \u2014 including the 120-meter sandbag sprint\n\nHis advice for station preparation is practical: \"Test one of the workouts, like 100 wall balls for time: if it takes you five minutes, you should be doing something on your legs that's five minutes straight. It's not rocket science\" (*Men's Health UK*).\n\nThursday in his HAOS PRO program is dedicated to **Hyrox Simulation** \u2014 race-specific workouts with transition practice and time trials. The program explicitly includes \"race simulation\" phases in weeks 5\u20138 of each training block.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Periodization & Peaking\n\nMcIntyre's periodization philosophy is blunt: \"Just periodisation, man\" (*Men's Health UK*). He alternates **endurance blocks with strength blocks**, fully focusing on each in turn rather than trying to train everything simultaneously.\n\n**HAOS PRO Periodization:**\n\n| Phase | Weeks | Focus |\n|---|---|---|\n| Phase 1: Base Building | 1\u20134 | Aerobic capacity, strength foundation, movement quality, work capacity |\n| Phase 2: Intensity Development | 5\u20138 | Lactate threshold, power development, skill refinement, race simulation |\n| Phase 3: Peak Performance | 9\u201312 | Competition preparation, tapering protocols, mental preparation, performance optimization |\n\nWithin each phase, the micro-cycle follows a **3 weeks on / 1 week deload** pattern.\n\nHis diet is also periodized: \"My diet is periodised, so I just got off a week of drinking as much as I could and eating ice cream\" (post-season). As he gets further into competition season, \"I start cutting out the rib-eye steak. You go towards the leaner cut of meat, or you go to fish and chicken\" (*Men's Health UK, 2025*).\n\n---\n\n### 6. Recovery & Lifestyle\n\n**Sleep:** McIntyre is notably unconventional here. He describes himself as \"not much of a sleeper,\" routinely waking at 4 AM regardless of bedtime \u2014 whether he goes to bed at 8 PM or midnight (*BarBend interview*). This is an outlier among elite athletes.\n\n**Nutrition:** McIntyre's diet is perhaps the most controversial aspect of his regimen:\n- **Daily calorie intake:** 4,500\u20135,500 calories\n- **Macros:** ~90g fat, 400\u2013600g carbs, 180\u2013250g protein\n- **Staple foods:** Steak (2\u20133 per day), chicken, yogurt, maple syrup, honey, fruit, bread, pasta, oatmeal, sweet potatoes, Honey Nut Cheerios, ramen noodles, sticky buns\n- **No vegetables.** He has stated: \"You can't pay me to eat vegetables\u2026 Superheroes aren't made of vegetables, they're made of calories\" (*Men's Health UK*). He claims this view was reinforced by sports nutritionist Dr. John Ivey.\n- **300\u2013500g of sugar per day:** \"Sugar's the shit, I love that stuff\" (*BarBend*)\n- **Morning ritual:** Strong Coffee (with collagen), BLDR aminos, 3 tablespoons of honey\n\n**Supplements:** He owns his own supplement company, **BLDR Sports**, and takes amino acids daily. He also takes collagen via his coffee brand.\n\n**Post-season recovery:** He takes a deliberate period of debauchery: \"I just got off a week of drinking as much as I could and eating ice cream\" before ramping strength training back up (*Men's Health UK, 2025*).\n\n---\n\n### 7. Unique/Differentiating Methods\n\n**The Alter Ego / \"The Sheriff\":** McIntyre uses an alter ego in competition \u2014 \"The Sheriff.\" He explains: \"You need an alter ego that comes out when necessary\" (*Men's Health UK*). He self-talks by \"relentlessly bad-mouthing himself, repeating only two or three words so he doesn't get distracted.\" This deliberate mental warfare extends to intimidating opponents: \"I treat this like war. I have tactics, I have strategy, I have mental warfare, I have physical warfare, I'll use guerrilla tactics\" (*HYROX podcast appearance, 2021*).\n\n**The Cold Bar Technique:** Performing heavy strength feats without any warm-up \u2014 lifting 250 lb stones cold, weighted pull-ups cold \u2014 as a grip and neural preparedness tool. No other Hyrox athletes publicly train this way.\n\n**The Lumberjack Workout:** No other elite Hyrox competitor integrates wood chopping, stump moving, and log carries as formal training modalities.\n\n**Single-Speed Cycling:** The \"Magnus the Mountain Slayer\" bike forces continuous pedaling with no ability to coast, building mental toughness and sustained power output for hours at a time.\n\n**Anti-Vegetable, Pro-Sugar Diet:** At 300\u2013500g of sugar per day with zero vegetable intake, McIntyre's nutrition is arguably the most extreme departure from conventional sports nutrition in elite fitness.\n\n**Pull-Up Contests with Naked Penalties:** He describes having athletes in his training group compete in pull-up contests where \"the loser has to run around the neighborhood naked\" \u2014 a psychological intensity tool (*BarBend interview*).\n\n---\n\n---\n\n## Jake Dearden \u2014 Elite UK Hyrox Specialist\n\n**Bio snapshot:** Age 26. Hyrox Men's Doubles World Champion (2024, with Marc Dean). Hyrox Master Trainer. Red Bull\u2013sponsored athlete. Former ultramarathon runner (100 km at age 19, 7 marathons in 7 days, 10 marathons in 5 days). Age group world record holder (57:09). Recovered from two slipped discs. Currently pursuing solo Elite 15 World Championship qualification. Sub-2:30 marathon goal.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Training Philosophy & Identity\n\nJake Dearden's core philosophy can be distilled into one quote: **\"Train as much as you can recover from.\"** He told *Men's Health*: \"My job at the moment is to train and become the best at Hyrox. If you're looking at my training and thinking, 'I need to do that amount,' but you've got a full-time job, you've got family and you're only sleeping four hours a night because you've got little kids, it's just not going to work.\"\n\nDearden describes himself as \"quite boring\" with his training. He favors **repeating the same movements week in, week out** so he can track progress objectively. He's deeply analytical and has sought expertise outside of Hyrox \u2014 strength coaches, movement coaches, running coaches, physios, and elite ultrarunners like Tom Evans \u2014 because he believes \"there are no Hyrox experts. You've got to look to other sports, where they've been doing it 40, 50 years\" (*Men's Health UK, 2025*).\n\nHis approach to Hyrox has evolved significantly. Initially, he focused heavily on running because \"there were a lot of professional runners or close-to-professional runners, triathletes and so on, who were coming into the sport and doing really well.\" After that block, he realized he'd \"neglected the strength work,\" so he pivoted to balance both domains.\n\nHe views each Hyrox station **in combination with the subsequent run**: \"I always look at the [workout station] and the run as one exercise, so if you're a strength athlete and you're amazing at the sled push, look at your sled push and your running time after as one exercise\" (*Men's Health UK*).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Weekly Training Structure\n\nBased on Jake Dearden's Myprotein feature (\"Full Week of Training as a HYROX Athlete\") and his various interviews, his typical weekly structure is:\n\n| Day | AM Session | PM Session |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Monday** | 5K progression run | Strength workout |\n| **Tuesday** | Strength workout | HYROX session (40\u201360 min engine-based workout incorporating Hyrox exercises) |\n| **Wednesday** | Row intervals (e.g., 10 \u00d7 500m with 2 min rest) | \u2014 |\n| **Thursday** | 10K progression run | Strength workout |\n| **Friday** | Rest or active recovery (easy 15K exercise bike, Zone 2) | \u2014 |\n| **Saturday** | Strength workout + team sweat session | \u2014 |\n| **Sunday** | HYROX session: 50-minute AMRAP with running and exercises | \u2014 |\n\n*(Source: Myprotein article)*\n\nFrom his YouTube content with Built For Athletes, his training involves approximately **30\u201340 minutes of intense running** with warm-up and cool-down on either side in morning sessions, with evening sessions focused more on \"erg work and practice but still at an intensity where I'm getting my heart rate up\" (*\"How A 26yr Old RedBull Athlete Is Dominating Fitness,\" YouTube, 2024*).\n\nKey notes from Dearden himself:\n- \"Some of these sessions take no more than 30 minutes. I rarely, almost never, spend three hours in the gym in one day.\"\n- He has a flexible schedule allowing AM/PM splits, which he acknowledges isn't possible for most people.\n- He emphasizes that his plan is **specific to him** and shouldn't be seen as prescriptive for all athletes.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Session Design Patterns\n\nDearden uses a mix of **progression runs, interval work, strength sessions, and HYROX-specific AMRAPs.**\n\nHis HYROX sessions are 40\u201360 minute engine-based workouts incorporating Hyrox movements. On Sundays, he does 50-minute AMRAPs that combine running with functional movements.\n\nHis rowing intervals follow a classic structure: **10 \u00d7 500m with 2 minutes rest** \u2014 a bread-and-butter erg conditioning protocol.\n\nHe favors **threshold running** as a key training modality, with an emphasis on power-to-weight ratio. From the RMR Training Podcast appearance: his threshold training sessions are structured around sustained efforts at specific paces, with the goal of improving lactate threshold and VO2 max.\n\nHe uses **accumulation and intensification phases** within his strength training: \"This intensification phase which often happens where the reps start to come down, you start to push it a little bit, because you've been on a leash during the accumulation phase\" (*YouTube: \"Training With 26yr Old RedBull Athlete Jake Dearden,\" 2025*).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Hyrox-Specific Preparation\n\nDearden prioritizes Hyrox stations **in order of race importance.** His hierarchy: \"Starting off with your SkiErg \u2013 that's the most important exercise. If your heart rate skyrockets at the ski and you struggle, that's going to fatigue you for the rest of the race. But if you get fatigued at the burpees [the fourth station], you've had a good first half of the race\" (*Men's Health UK*).\n\nHe integrates running with station work **only in the final 5\u20136 weeks** before a race. Before that, he separates running and strength: \"I usually split up my running and my strength until about five to six weeks out from a race. Then I might swap out a couple of sessions so I'm doing some weights and then going straight into running, to practise running under fatigue. That prepares my body. But I think working on your running separately is going to be much more beneficial than trying to do everything fatigued all the time\" (*Men's Health UK*).\n\n---\n\n### 5. Periodization & Peaking\n\nDearden follows a clear **block periodization model** with three phases, as outlined in his Built For Athletes article:\n\n| Timeframe Before Race | Focus |\n|---|---|\n| **12+ weeks out** | Building a solid base of fitness (running & ergs), building overall strength, progressing all fitness elements |\n| **12\u20136 weeks out** | Add Hyrox-specific exercises, progress to race-day weights, at least 1 Hyrox session per week, focus on muscular endurance and running speed |\n| **6\u20131 weeks out** | Very specific Hyrox exercises and quantities mimicking race day, replicate race-day scenarios, practice technique/tactics, increase Hyrox sessions, trial race-day nutrition |\n| **Race week** | Deload: reduced intensity and frequency, rest days approaching race day, ensure nutrition/sleep are optimal |\n\nHe learned from ultrarunner Tom Evans that \"it was all about what you do in the month prior and how that affects your race\" (*Men's Health UK*).\n\n---\n\n### 6. Recovery & Lifestyle\n\n**Recovery as #1 Rule:** Dearden's biggest lesson came from injury \u2014 two slipped discs caused by neglecting recovery during his ultramarathon days. \"Not prioritising recovery is probably the thing that I regret most\" (*Men's Health UK*). He now states that **mobility training is \"non-negotiable\"** and has called it a \"game-changer\" in his return to competition (*Wellworthy*).\n\n**Biometric Tracking:** He uses heart rate variability (HRV) and sleep quality data to dictate daily training load. \"If the numbers are down, the intensity drops\" (*Wellworthy*).\n\n**Nutrition:** Dearden follows a high-protein approach:\n- Protein target: **1.7\u20132.2g per kg of bodyweight per day**\n- Prioritizes carbohydrates before training (bagels, porridge oats, rice, bananas)\n- 80/20 rule: 80% whole foods, 20% flexible\n- Includes healthy fats from animal fats and nuts\n- Carb-loads the day before a race\n\n**Supplements:** Caffeine (only before midday during training; unrestricted on race day), creatine daily, electrolytes (\"non-negotiable\"), and has been testing bicarbonate of soda gels as a lactate buffer.\n\n**Post-race:** Always has a protein shake ready immediately after finishing for recovery advantage. Celebrates with a \"nice meal\" rather than drinking.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Unique/Differentiating Methods\n\n**Station-Run Coupling Framework:** Dearden's perspective of treating each station + the following run as a single exercise unit is a distinctive analytical framework that informs both his training and race pacing.\n\n**Expert Aggregation Model:** Rather than following a single Hyrox coach, he deliberately consults specialists from disparate sports (ultrarunning, strength and conditioning, movement science, physiotherapy) and synthesizes their advice for Hyrox application. He's stated: \"Hyrox hasn't been around for very long. Even though there are Hyrox coaches out there, there are no Hyrox experts\" (*Men's Health UK*).\n\n**Late-Stage Integration:** His unique periodization approach of keeping running and strength completely separate until the final 5\u20136 weeks before a race, then introducing combined \"run under fatigue\" sessions, contrasts with many Hyrox coaches who advocate mixed-modal training year-round.\n\n**Mental Performance:** Dearden has worked on managing race-day nerves that previously consumed him for two weeks pre-race. After speaking with a sports psychologist, he adopted the principle: \"The race is going to happen no matter what, so there's no point thinking about it two weeks beforehand\" (*Men's Health UK*). He now focuses on enjoying the lead-up and only \"switching on\" on race day.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n## Dan Churchill \u2014 Chef, Hybrid Athlete, Hyrox Content Creator\n\n**Bio snapshot:** Australian-born, NYC-based professional chef and hybrid athlete. Master's degree in Exercise Science. Former strength and conditioning coach for rugby and AFL athletes. Executive chef at The Osprey (1 Hotel Brooklyn). Author of *Eat Like a Legend*. Partner with Centr (Chris Hemsworth's fitness app). Leadville 100 finisher. Currently chasing a sub-60 Hyrox finish. YouTube series documenting his Hyrox journey (@danchurchillcooks).\n\n---\n\n### 1. Training Philosophy & Identity\n\nDan Churchill represents a uniquely **nutrition-first, multisport hybrid** approach to Hyrox. His background bridges exercise science and professional cooking, giving him a perspective that most Hyrox athletes lack.\n\nHis core philosophy: \"I grew up playing rugby, and our training was intense\u2014weights, sprints, long efforts, skills. I loved it. Honestly, I loved the training even more than the game. It gave me a solid foundation in programming, which became part of my role as a strength and conditioning coach. I took that philosophy and applied it to the way I now train for Hyrox. It's the same methodology, just refined\" (*The Hybrid Letter, 2025*).\n\nChurchill is transparent about **not being a natural speedster:** \"I've never seen myself as an elite athlete. I wasn't born with top-end speed, but I've got a great engine\u2014my heart rate and recovery are excellent. Speed, though? Not my strength\" (*The Hybrid Letter*). This honesty is central to his content \u2014 he documents both \"the highs and lows of his journey\" (*RXR Sports bio*).\n\nHis training philosophy prioritizes three pillars in order: **Sleep, nutrition, and hydration \u2014 \"those are my big three\"** (*The Hybrid Letter*).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Weekly Training Structure\n\nChurchill trains **4\u201312 sessions per week** depending on the phase, balancing his training with his career as a chef and content creator. His YouTube series provides windows into his actual training days.\n\nBased on his content and interviews, his typical structure during a Hyrox block includes:\n- **AM track workouts** (speed sessions, interval running)\n- **Midday weight training sessions**\n- **HYROX-specific simulation efforts** focused on maintaining Zone 4 heart rate\n\nFrom his YouTube series (Episode 8, Italy/NYC, 2025): he describes \"incorporating simulation efforts to stay in Zone 4, geared towards Hyrox prep\" and \"crushing a workout session with the team at Meatpacking Athletic.\"\n\nChurchill's **7-week training block** for the Chicago Hyrox 2024 was documented in Episode 5 of his YouTube series, where he was chasing a sub-60 Hyrox finish. His entry time started at 1:11, improved to 1:08, and his target for Chicago was between 1:07\u20131:08.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Session Design Patterns\n\nChurchill uses **performance testing as a training design tool.** In Episode 10 of his YouTube series (February 2025), he underwent: blood work to understand his internal state, a heart rate zone test, and a VO2 max assessment. \"The day starts with a speed session, followed by a blood test, weight training, a heart rate & VO2 Max test.\"\n\nHe structures workouts around **heart rate zones**, particularly:\n- **Zone 2** for aerobic base building\n- **Zone 4** for Hyrox-specific simulation work (threshold intensity)\n\nHis approach differs from pure Hyrox athletes because he also trains for other endurance events (Leadville 100, Sydney Marathon), requiring periodization across modalities.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Hyrox-Specific Preparation\n\nChurchill's biggest Hyrox lesson was underestimating the running: \"I underestimated the running. It's 70% of the event, and I didn't fully factor in how much it would affect fatigue. Going from a run into burpee broad jumps is a different beast. Even though I'm solid at burpees, that transition was brutal\" (*The Hybrid Letter*).\n\nHe focuses on **learning to \"ride out Zone 4 and get back into rhythm\"** \u2014 the ability to sustain threshold-level effort through station transitions and back into running.\n\nHis content with Hunter McIntyre (YouTube Episode 2: \"Day In The Life Of A Professional Chef and Hybrid Athlete | Hyrox Training W/ McIntyre\") shows him training directly alongside McIntyre, absorbing elite-level Hyrox session design.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Periodization & Peaking\n\nChurchill structures his Hyrox prep in training blocks. His Chicago 2024 prep was a focused **7-week training block**. For his World Championships qualification (YouTube Episode 1, November 2025), he documented the beginning of a new dedicated prep block.\n\nHe has stated that \"Leadville last year taught me the value of preparation. It's about putting in the reps and improving 1% every day\" (*The Hybrid Letter*). His long-term trajectory shows a deliberate, multi-year build toward his sub-60 goal rather than a single peak cycle.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Recovery & Lifestyle\n\n**Nutrition \u2014 Churchill's Superpower:** As a professional chef with a Master's in Exercise Science, his nutrition approach is arguably the most sophisticated of any Hyrox athlete:\n- He focuses on **meal timing** \u2014 the right macros at the right time relative to training\n- Has increased caloric intake after realizing \"I used to just eat a banana before training\u2014maybe 30 grams of carbs\u2014but I didn't account for how much I was burning, even in Zone 2\" (*The Hybrid Letter*)\n- Added **fish oil regularly** for omega-3s\n- Uses **Complex G1 from BPN** for additional carbs\n- Increased **Vitamin D3** (through AG1)\n- Reduces dietary fat around workouts for quicker energy access\n- Avoids dense protein and high-fat meals within 2 hours of sleep\n\n**Sleep:** Churchill uses a **Whoop strap** and has noted that three months of poor sleep visibly impacted his hormones, Zone 2 heart rate, and recovery. He emphasizes the importance of **REM and deep sleep** specifically, not just time in bed. He recommends finishing eating at least 2 hours before sleep and avoiding insulin-spiking carbs before bed.\n\n**Hydration:** Listed as one of his \"big three\" alongside sleep and nutrition.\n\n**Supplement Protocol:**\n- AG1 (for Vitamin D3 and micronutrients)\n- Fish oil (omega-3)\n- Complex G1 from BPN (carbohydrate supplement)\n- Whoop strap for biometric recovery tracking\n\n---\n\n### 7. Unique/Differentiating Methods\n\n**Chef-Athlete Dual Identity:** Churchill is the only elite-level Hyrox content creator who is simultaneously a professional chef. His recipe-creation for athletes \u2014 bridging the gap between nutritionist recommendations and practical cooking \u2014 is genuinely unique. He created athlete-friendly recipes for rugby players early in his career and applies the same approach to hybrid athletes.\n\n**Micronutrient Focus:** He refers to micronutrients as \"the fifth macronutrient\" \u2014 an unusual level of attention to vitamins and minerals among Hyrox athletes who typically focus only on protein, carbs, and fats.\n\n**Science-Backed Content:** His Master's in Exercise Science gives his training and nutrition advice a research foundation that most Hyrox athlete-influencers lack. He writes the *Legendary* newsletter sharing \"science-backed, actionable insights on nutrition, performance, and recovery.\"\n\n**Multi-Endurance Background:** Having completed the Leadville 100 ultramarathon, a Sydney Marathon, and pursuing sub-60 Hyrox simultaneously, Churchill brings a cross-endurance perspective. His aerobic engine is built from ultra-distance work, which he applies to Hyrox's shorter but more intense demands.\n\n**Transparency in the Process:** Churchill documents his blood work, VO2 max testing, and performance metrics publicly. This data-driven transparency \u2014 including sharing actual numbers and setbacks \u2014 is more granular than what most Hyrox athletes reveal.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n## Jason Khalipa \u2014 CrossFit Games Champion Crossing Into Hyrox\n\n**Bio snapshot:** 2008 CrossFit Games Individual Champion. 3\u00d7 Team USA CrossFit member. Founder and CEO of NCFIT gyms and TRAIN HARD online training. Author of *As Many Reps As Possible*. Host of the Jason Khalipa Podcast (formerly \"Effort Over Everything\"). Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu brown belt. Pediatric cancer advocate. Competed in HYROX Dallas Pro Doubles (2024) with partner Gabe Yanez.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Training Philosophy & Identity\n\nJason Khalipa's training philosophy is defined by what he calls the **AMRAP Mentality** \u2014 extended beyond the gym into a life philosophy. In his book *As Many Reps As Possible*, he outlines five core principles:\n\n1. **Know your WHY** \u2014 use your purpose to fuel your effort\n2. **Focus on what you can control**\n3. **Work hard**\n4. **Switch gears** \u2014 be fully present in each task\n5. **Re-evaluate** \u2014 adjust priorities as life changes\n\n*(Source: Goodreads / Mark Bell's PowerCast #200)*\n\nHe's described the AMRAP mentality as: \"Taking as many 'reps' as possible of the task in front of you, giving it your best, and then moving on to the next task, and repeat\" (*Mark Bell's PowerCast*).\n\nKhalipa's approach to fitness is **pragmatic and time-efficient.** Having transitioned from elite-level CrossFit competition to running businesses, raising a family, and training BJJ, he now prioritizes \"protectors and providers\" \u2014 people with limited training hours who need maximum fitness return on investment. His TRAIN HARD platform is built around this ethos.\n\nHis first experience with Hyrox was documented in a three-part YouTube series (\"Training for HYROX,\" November\u2013December 2024) where he and Gabe Yanez competed in the Pro Doubles division at HYROX Dallas. The first episode was titled \"CrossFit Games Champion **Humbled** By HYROX\" \u2014 indicating the learning curve even for a CrossFit legend.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Weekly Training Structure\n\nKhalipa's current weekly structure (outside of specific Hyrox prep) includes:\n\n| Time Slot | Activity |\n|---|---|\n| Early AM | Cardio and/or ruck walks |\n| Midday | NCFIT workout (NCX track \u2014 includes strength + WOD) |\n| Various (3\u00d7/week) | Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu |\n| Active recovery | Long walks (daily minimum) |\n\n*(Source: T-Nation AMA, 2024)*\n\nHe describes his approach: \"I train BJJ 3\u00d7 a week and do our NCFIT workouts daily. I also typically do early AM cardio and/or ruck walks to start the day. If I feel super fatigued, I'll try and reduce the volume. However, doing nothing isn't something I really ever do. I'll at a minimum go for a long walk\" (*T-Nation AMA*).\n\n**During his professional CrossFit career,** his daily structure was more intensive and divided into three distinct blocks:\n- **AM:** Cardio\n- **Midday:** CrossFit (couplets, triplets, and for-time workouts)\n- **Evening:** Stamina building on gymnastic movements (e.g., 10-minute EMOM of 10 strict pull-ups)\n\n*(Source: T-Nation AMA)*\n\nFor Hyrox-specific preparation, he worked with legendary endurance coach **Chris",
