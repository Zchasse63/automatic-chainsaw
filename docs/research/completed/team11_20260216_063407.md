## CRITICAL ERROR CORRECTIONS

| # | v1 Model Error | Correct Answer | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | "Sled pull weight is same as sled push" | **WRONG.** Sled push is heavier than sled pull in every division. | Official HYROX Rulebook 2024/25 & 2025/26, §9.2 & §9.3 |
| 2 | "Run 8 is after Farmer's Carry" | **WRONG.** Run 8 is after Sandbag Lunges (Station 7). Farmer's Carry is Station 6. | Official HYROX Rulebook §8.1 / §9 station numbering |
| 3 | "This run is downhill in most venues" | **WRONG.** ALL Hyrox races are held indoors on flat surfaces. There are no hills or elevation changes. | Official HYROX Rulebook §1: "HYROX, an indoor mass participation fitness competition"; Wikipedia confirms "hosted indoors in exhibition halls or convention centers." |
| 4 | "World record 1:39 by Alexander Roncevic" for sled push | **CANNOT VERIFY as a sled push station record.** Alexander Roncevic holds the Men's Pro *overall race* world record of 53:15 (Hamburg, Oct 2025). HYROX does not officially publish individual station world records. | roxlyfe.com/hyrox-world-records (last updated Feb 2026) |

|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Sled Push** | 50m (4×12.5m) | **102 kg** incl. sled | **152 kg** incl. sled | **202 kg** incl. sled |
| **Sled Pull** | 50m (4×12.5m) | **78 kg** incl. sled | **103 kg** incl. sled | **153 kg** incl. sled |
| **Burpee Broad Jumps** | 80m | Bodyweight | Bodyweight | Bodyweight |
| **Farmer's Carry** | 200m | 2 × 16 kg (white) | 2 × 24 kg (grey) | 2 × 32 kg (black) |
| **Sandbag Lunges** | 100m | 10 kg (white) | 20 kg (grey) | 30 kg (black) |
| **Wall Balls** | 100 reps | 4 kg ball | 6 kg ball | 9 kg ball |
| **Wall Ball Target Height** | — | 2.70 m | Women: 2.70 m / Men: 3.00 m | 3.00 m |

| **Rowing** | 1,000 m | Same for all | Same for all | Same for all |
| **Running** | 8 × 1,000 m | Same for all | Same for all | Same for all |

**Damper Settings** (2025/26 Season): Preset to **Resistance 6 for ALL divisions** on both SkiErg and Rower. Athletes may adjust as desired. *(Source: 2025/26 Rulebook §9.1 — note: this changed from 2024/25 where it was 5/6/7 by division)*

#### Station Weights — Doubles

| Station | Distance/Reps | Doubles Women | Doubles Men / Doubles Mixed / Doubles Women Pro | Doubles Men Pro |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Sled Push** | 50m total (YGIG) | **102 kg** incl. sled | **152 kg** incl. sled | **202 kg** incl. sled |
| **Sled Pull** | 50m total (YGIG) | **78 kg** incl. sled | **103 kg** incl. sled | **153 kg** incl. sled |
| **Burpee Broad Jumps** | 80m total (YGIG) | Bodyweight | Bodyweight | Bodyweight |
| **Farmer's Carry** | 200m total (YGIG) | 2 × 16 kg (white) | 2 × 24 kg (grey) | 2 × 32 kg (black) |

*Mixed Doubles wall ball target: Women use 2.70m target, Men use 3.00m target.*

#### Relay Division
Relay teams (4 people) use **Open division weights**. Each person completes 2 runs + 2 stations. *(Source: hellohyrox.com verified against official relay rulebook description)*

### Sled Push vs. Sled Pull: Weight Difference Breakdown

| Division | Sled Push (incl. sled) | Sled Pull (incl. sled) | Difference (Push heavier by) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Open Women | 102 kg | 78 kg | **24 kg** |
| Pro Women / Open Men | 152 kg | 103 kg | **49 kg** |
| Pro Men | 202 kg | 153 kg | **49 kg** |

**Why the difference?** The sled pull is lighter because the pulling motion (hand-over-hand rope pulling while standing stationary in a box) is biomechanically more demanding — it relies primarily on upper body (arms, back, grip) rather than the powerful leg drive available in a sled push. Additionally, the athlete cannot use bodyweight as leverage the way they can when pushing. The lighter weight on the pull compensates for this biomechanical disadvantage.

**Note on sled weight:** The listed weights are **total weight including the sled itself.** The sled body typically weighs approximately 30–52 kg depending on the model. The "added plates" are stacked on top. For example, Men Pro sled push = ~52 kg sled + ~150 kg in plates = 202 kg total. *(Source: pace-club.com notes sled is "usually ~30-40 kg"; exact sled weight varies by model)*

## 2. STATION ORDER & RUN MAPPING

### The Exact Complete Race Sequence
*(Source: Official HYROX Rulebook 2025/26 §8.1 + §9.1-9.8; fitnessexperiment.co; confirmed identical across all sources)*

| Segment | Activity | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **START** | Start Tunnel | Inflatable tunnel with countdown, lights, hype |
| **Run 1** | 1 km run | First run; may be slightly shorter, balanced later |
| **Station 1** | **SkiErg** | 1,000 m |
| **Run 2** | 1 km run | |
| **Station 2** | **Sled Push** | 50 m (4 × 12.5 m) |
| **Run 3** | 1 km run | |
| **Station 3** | **Sled Pull** | 50 m (4 × 12.5 m) |
| **Run 4** | 1 km run | |
| **Station 4** | **Burpee Broad Jumps** | 80 m |
| **Run 5** | 1 km run | |
| **Station 5** | **Rowing** | 1,000 m |
| **Run 6** | 1 km run | |
| **Station 6** | **Farmer's Carry** | 200 m |
| **Run 7** | 1 km run | |
| **Station 7** | **Sandbag Lunges** | 100 m |
| **Run 8** | 1 km run | |
| **Station 8** | **Wall Balls** | 100 reps |
| **FINISH** | Finisher Stage | Up ramp to finish line — **NO run after Wall Balls** |

### Station-to-Run Mapping with Fatigue Impact

| Run | Preceded By | Followed By | Fatigue Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Run 1** | Start tunnel | SkiErg (St. 1) | Fresh legs; use to warm up and settle into pace. Don't blast out too fast. |
| **Run 2** | SkiErg (St. 1) | Sled Push (St. 2) | Upper body slightly fatigued from ski pulling motion; legs relatively fresh. Breathing may be elevated. |
| **Run 3** | Sled Push (St. 2) | Sled Pull (St. 3) | Quads and glutes fatigued from heavy sled push; this is one of the hardest runs. Legs feel heavy, especially the first 200m. |
| **Run 4** | Sled Pull (St. 3) | Burpee Broad Jumps (St. 4) | Forearms, biceps, and back fatigued from pulling; legs had some rest during the pull. Running feels easier than post-push. |
| **Run 5** | Burpee Broad Jumps (St. 4) | Rowing (St. 5) | Full-body fatigue; shoulders from burpees, quads from repeated jumping. Heart rate typically spikes. Mental low point for many. |
| **Run 6** | Rowing (St. 5) | Farmer's Carry (St. 6) | Legs tired from rowing drive phase; back/arms pre-fatigued. Use this run to recover for the grip-intensive carry. |
| **Run 7** | Farmer's Carry (St. 6) | Sandbag Lunges (St. 7) | Forearms/grip fatigued but legs relatively fresh (carry is mostly walking). However, overall accumulated fatigue is high. |
| **Run 8** | Sandbag Lunges (St. 7) | Wall Balls (St. 8) | **The hardest run.** Quads and glutes are destroyed from 100m of lunges. Many athletes struggle to run; walking portions common. This is the most critical run to train for. |

### Has the Station Order Ever Changed?
The station order has remained the same since HYROX's inception. It is **identical for the 2024/25 and 2025/26 seasons.** The official HYROX website and all sources confirm: "The same eight workout stations, always in the same order." *(Source: fitnessexperiment.co; rezerv.co)*

**One historical change:** Women's Wall Balls were increased from **75 reps to 100 reps** in the Open and Women's Doubles divisions starting from September 2024 (Cape Town event, 21 Sept 2024). Pro Women have always done 100 reps. *(Source: roxlyfe.com world records page, Note 2)*

## 3. VENUE DETAILS

### Indoor/Outdoor Confirmation
**CONFIRMED: Nearly all HYROX races are held INDOORS.**
- Official Rulebook §1 (both 2024/25 and 2025/26): *"HYROX, an indoor mass participation fitness competition"*
- Typical venues: **convention centers, exhibition halls, arena/expo complexes** (e.g., ExCeL London, Javits Center NYC, Messe Hamburg)
- **One known exception:** Wikipedia notes: *"Occasional events have been hosted outdoors, including Miami in 2023."* This is extremely rare and not the norm.
- *(Sources: HYROX Official Rulebook §1; Wikipedia "Hyrox" article; fitnessexperiment.co)*

### Running Surface
- **Sled stations:** HYROX uses the official **HYROX × Centr Perform Turf** — a custom-engineered 16mm polyethylene/polypropylene artificial turf specifically designed for sled push/pull. Debuted at 2025 World Championships in Chicago, now rolling out globally. *(Source: centr.com shop listing; roxlyfe.com; findyouredge.app)*
- **Running track:** The running surface varies by venue — typically the **concrete/hard floor of the exhibition hall**, sometimes with thin carpet or rubber overlay. It is NOT on outdoor pavement, grass, or standard athletic track rubber. The floor is hard and flat.
- **Burpee Broad Jumps / Lunges:** Generally performed on turf or the venue floor.
- *(Source: Various race reports; HYROX turf product specs; venue walkthrough videos)*

### Is the Course FLAT?
**YES — confirmed FLAT. No hills, no elevation changes, no inclines.** All races are inside exhibition halls with level concrete floors. The only minor "elevation" is the small ramp up to the finisher stage at the very end. *(Source: All official rulebooks; venue walkthroughs; every course map shows flat layout)*

### Turns on the Running Course
**Yes, there are turns.** The running course is typically an oval/loop around the perimeter of the exhibition hall. Depending on the venue:
- Rectangular venues may have **4 turns** (roughly 90-degree corners per lap)
- Turns can be relatively tight in some venues
- Multiple laps per 1km means multiple turns per run segment
- At HYROX London ExCeL 2025, the course was a single full 1km lap — the first time this was done *(reducing total turns)*
- *(Source: fitnessexperiment.co; YouTube venue walkthroughs)*

### Course Layout
- **Running course:** A **loop** around the outside perimeter of the venue (not out-and-back). The running track encircles the workout station area.
- **Laps per 1km run:** Varies by venue:
  - ~250m track → **4 laps** per 1km
  - ~300-333m track → **3 laps** per 1km
  - ~500m track → **2 laps** per 1km
  - ~1000m track → **1 lap** (rare; HYROX London ExCeL 2025 was the first)
  - Check venue-specific athlete guide for exact lap count
- **Station areas:** All 8 workout stations are located **inside the running loop**, accessed through the Roxzone via IN/OUT arches
- **Roxzone:** Transition corridor between the running track and the stations; adds approximately 700m to total distance over 8 transitions (total course distance ≈ 8.7km including Roxzone, per HYROX's own statement)
- **Station physical placement:** Stations are not necessarily laid out in numerical order within the venue — athletes must find the correct arch for their current station number
- *(Source: fitnessexperiment.co; Official Rulebook §8.3; 2025/26 Rulebook §8.3)*

### Spectator Areas
- **Spectator grandstand ("Thunderdome"):** Usually located near Station 8 (Wall Balls) and the finish line
- Spectators can see the wall balls area and finish clearly
- Spectators **cannot** see the entire race — the running track and most stations are spread across a large venue
- Some venues have additional viewing areas along the running track or near certain stations
- Spectators are **not permitted** in the warm-up area
- *(Source: fitnessexperiment.co; Official 2025/26 Rulebook §12.3)*

### Venue Temperature
**UNVERIFIED from official sources.** Exhibition halls are typically climate-controlled but can get warm due to:
- Thousands of athletes generating heat
- Indoor venues with limited airflow
- Estimated typical conditions: 18-25°C (65-77°F), variable humidity
- Athletes should prepare for warmer-than-expected indoor conditions

## Original Prompt

```
You are a Hyrox rules and data specialist building a verified fact database for an AI-powered Hyrox coach. The coach's v1 model made factual errors about sled weights, station order, venue details, and world records. This research must provide 100% accurate, verifiable data.

## CRITICAL ERRORS TO FIX
1. Model said sled pull weight is "same as sled push" — WRONG (push is heavier than pull)
2. Model said "Run 8 is after Farmers Carry" — WRONG (Run 8 is after Sandbag Lunges)
3. Model said "This run is downhill in most venues" — WRONG (all Hyrox races are indoors, flat)
4. Model claimed "World record 1:39 by Alexander Roncevic" for sled push — cannot verify

## 1. Complete Weight Tables

### CRITICAL: Provide exact weights for EVERY station in EVERY division

Format as a clear table. For each station, list the weight for:
- Open Men (individual)
- Open Women (individual)
- Pro Men (individual)
- Pro Women (individual)
- Doubles Men
- Doubles Women
- Doubles Mixed
- Relay (if different)

Stations that use weights:
1. **Sled Push** — What is the total sled weight? (sled + added weight)
2. **Sled Pull** — What is the total sled weight? (MUST BE DIFFERENT from sled push!)
3. **Farmer's Carry** — Weight per hand? Total weight?
4. **Sandbag Lunges** — Sandbag weight?
5. **Wall Balls** — Ball weight? Target height?
6. **SkiErg** — Distance (1000m for all?)
7. **Rowing** — Distance (1000m for all?)
8. **Burpee Broad Jumps** — Distance (80m for all?)

### Sled Push vs Sled Pull Weight Difference
- Explicitly state: sled push weight ≠ sled pull weight
- Provide the exact difference for each division
- Why are they different? (sled pull is lighter because the pulling motion is harder)

## 2. Station Order & Run Mapping

### The Exact Sequence
List the COMPLETE race sequence in order:
- Run 1 → Station 1 (name) → Run 2 → Station 2 (name) → ... → Run 8 → Station 8 (name) → Finish Run

### Station-to-Run Mapping
For EACH of the 8 runs, state:
- Which station precedes it
- Which station follows it
- How the preceding station typically affects running (e.g., "Run 7 follows Farmer's Carry — forearms are fatigued but legs are relatively fresh")

### The Correct Station Order (verify each):
1. SkiErg (1000m)
2. Sled Push (50m)
3. Sled Pull (50m)
4. Burpee Broad Jumps (80m)
5. Rowing (1000m)
6. Farmer's Carry (200m)
7. Sandbag Lunges (100m)
8. Wall Balls (100 reps)

Is this order correct for 2024/2025 and 2025/2026 seasons? Has it ever changed?

## 3. Venue Details

### Indoor/Outdoor
- ALL Hyrox races are held INDOORS — confirm this
- Typical venue types: convention centers, exhibition halls, arenas
- Running surface: what surface do athletes run on? (artificial turf? rubber? concrete?)
- Is the course FLAT? (answer should be YES — no hills, no elevation changes)
- Are there turns on the running course? How tight?
- Typical venue temperature and conditions

### Course Layout
- Is the running course a loop or out-and-back?
- How many laps per 1km run section?
- Where are the station areas relative to the running course?
- Spectator areas — can spectators see the whole race?

## 4. World Records & Benchmarks

### Verified World Records
For each of these, provide: Name, Time, Date, Event Location (or state "cannot verify")
- Men's Individual (Open)
- Men's Individual (Pro)
- Women's Individual (Open)
- Women's Individual (Pro)
- Men's Doubles
- Women's Doubles
- Mixed Doubles

### Realistic Time Benchmarks
What are realistic finishing times for each level?
- Complete beginner / first-timer
- Recreational fitness (works out 3-4x/week)
- Intermediate competitor (2nd or 3rd Hyrox)
- Competitive / age group podium
- Elite / Pro division
- World class

### Station Time Benchmarks
For an intermediate male athlete (~75-80 minute finish), provide realistic times for each station:
- SkiErg 1000m
- Sled Push 50m
- Sled Pull 50m
- Burpee Broad Jumps 80m
- Rowing 1000m
- Farmer's Carry 200m
- Sandbag Lunges 100m
- Wall Balls 100 reps
- Average 1km run split

## 5. Official Rules & Penalties

### General Rules
- What equipment can athletes bring?
- What is prohibited?
- Are headphones allowed?
- Timing chip/bib placement rules

### Station Rules
- Sled push: must the sled cross a line? What if it stops moving?
- Sled pull: hand-over-hand required? Can you walk back to the sled?
- Wall balls: what counts as a valid rep? (ball must hit target line)
- Burpee broad jumps: what counts as a valid rep? Chest must touch floor?
- Farmer's carry: can you put the weights down and rest? Penalty?
- Sandbag lunges: knee must touch ground?

### Penalties
- What happens if you miss reps at a station?
- What happens if the sled doesn't cross the finish line?
- DQ conditions — what can get you disqualified?

### 2025/2026 Rule Changes
- Have any rules changed for the current season?
- Any weight changes?
- Any station format changes?

Provide ONLY verified, sourced information. Include the source (Hyrox official website, rulebook, race manual) for every major claim. If data cannot be verified, clearly state "UNVERIFIED" next to it.
