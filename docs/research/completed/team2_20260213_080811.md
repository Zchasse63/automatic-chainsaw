## Hunter McIntyre — "The Sheriff," "King of Hyrox"

**Bio snapshot:** 6'2", ~205 lb (93 kg). Three-time Hyrox World Champion. Six-time OCR World Champion. Murph world record holder (34:13). Former Broken Skull Challenge winner. CrossFit Games wildcard competitor (61st place, 2019). Hyrox world record of 53:22. Founder of HAOS Training (Hunter's Academy of Strength). Based between Malibu, CA and Boulder, CO.

---

### 1. Training Philosophy & Identity

Hunter McIntyre's core training philosophy is rooted in **consistency, progressive overload, and brutally high volume.** He has described himself as someone who treats competition "like war" with "tactics, strategy, mental warfare, physical warfare, guerrilla tactics" (*The Fastest Man in Fitness Podcast, EP.02*). His approach is unapologetically old-school and contrarian.

McIntyre's three foundational principles of training progression:
1. **Increase strength and position** — progressive overload with heavier loads.
2. **Increase speed and position** — faster reps at higher resistance.
3. **Increase endurance and position** — add more volume over time.

*(Source: BarBend interview, 2023)*

He writes his own programming and has done so for most of his career, though he has periodically hired coaches when his schedule becomes too busy: "I recently hired a coach because I'm so busy I don't want to think" (*Men's Health UK, 2022*). He also programs for his HAOS Training app, which serves athletes across all Hyrox tiers.

What makes McIntyre unique is his **hybrid lumberjack-athlete identity.** His foundation was literally built chopping trees during a substance-abuse rehab program after high school: "The necessity of the job turned me from a boy into a man, physically, mentally, and emotionally" (*Hook and Barrel*). He still incorporates wood chopping, stone lifting, and tire flipping into his training regimen.

He has stated: "Just get used to running an hour straight. It's an endurance event. I hold the world record, and I'm fucking running my ass off the whole time" (*Men's Health UK*). He believes Hyrox is "almost all legs" and recommends heavy squatting, wall balls, box step-ups, and lunges at least three days per week.

---

### 2. Weekly Training Structure

McIntyre describes a "great week" (when not traveling) as **six hours in the gym and 10–14 hours of cardio** (*Men's Health UK, 2022*). His HAOS HYROX PRO program prescribes:

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| **Training days/week** | 6 |
| **Sessions per day** | 1–2 |
| **Session duration** | 45–180 minutes |
| **Weekly time commitment** | 5–10 hours (program); up to 16–20 hours (his personal training) |
| **Cycle structure** | 3 weeks intensity build → 1 week recovery/deload |
| **Endurance sessions** | Can last up to 3 hours |

**Sample HAOS PRO Weekly Split:**

| Day | Focus |
|---|---|
| Monday | Heavy Strength + Short Conditioning (deadlift variations, pull-up progressions, 20-minute EMOM) |
| Tuesday | Running Focus + Accessories (interval running, sled work, core strengthening) |
| Wednesday | Full Body Power (Olympic lift variations, plyometric training, conditioning circuit) |
| Thursday | Hyrox Simulation (race-specific workout, transition practice, time trials) |
| Friday | Strength Endurance (high-rep strength work, muscular endurance, fatigue management) |
| Saturday | Long Conditioning (extended aerobic work, movement quality, recovery focus) |

*(Source: HAOS Training / hyroxtrainingplans.com)*

His personal training always includes **at least one upper body intensity day, one lower body intensity day, and one dedicated track day** every week (*BarBend interview*). He splits training between Boulder, CO (altitude training near the Flat Irons) and Malibu/Big Bear, CA.

---

### 3. Session Design Patterns

McIntyre favors **EMOMs, AMRAPs, and interval-based formats** for conditioning work. He combines these with traditional heavy lifting.

**Documented workout examples:**

**Hyrox Simulation Workout (filmed in NYC, 2025):**
- 18-minute EMOM: Sled push + TRX rows, alternating between 2-minute hard efforts with 1-minute rest or continuous flow.
- Then: 5 rounds of 20-calorie row + 20 burpees, aiming for each round to fit within ~1 minute of work.

*(Source: "HYROX Training with 3X World Champion Hunter McIntyre in NYC," YouTube, 2025)*

**Training Camp Workout (Episode 6, YouTube, 2024):**
- 20–25 minute AMRAP: 25 TRX rows → sled pull → 30 shoulder presses, with 10–15 minute active recovery on the bike between sets. Athletes choose shoulder press weight where they can hit 20 unbroken.

**The "Lumberjack Workout" (Hook and Barrel):**
- 10 minutes of wood chopping
- 5 minutes of heavy stump moving (pushing and pulling stumps)
- 5 rounds of max-effort tire slam intervals: 30 seconds work / 30 seconds rest
- 3–5 × 200-foot steep hill climbs carrying a 50–100 lb log

**The 20-Rep Squat Protocol:**
McIntyre sells an 8-week "20 Rep Squat Strength Guide" through HAOS Training, described as "formulated by Hunter McIntyre on his mission to win world titles." The protocol: pick a weight you think you'd be lucky to get 10 reps with, then don't stop until you've done 20 (*Men's Health UK*). This full-body plan is designed to "boost your strength and stamina through a 20-rep cycle."

**Cold Bar Technique for Grip Strength:**
McIntyre performs feats of athleticism and strength **without warming up** — a deliberately shocking stimulus. Examples include:
- "He-Man Challenge": 15 pull-ups cold with a 50 lb weight vest
- 17 pull-ups on a fingerboard (fingers in grip holes)
- 120-meter sandbag sprint in under 20 seconds

*(Source: BarBend interview)*

**Cycling Endurance:**
He rides "Magnus the Mountain Slayer," a single-speed bike, for 2+ hours. Because it's single-speed, if he stops pedaling he falls off, building what he calls "almost unstoppable physical and mental capacity" (*Men's Health UK*).

---

### 4. Hyrox-Specific Preparation

McIntyre approaches Hyrox station training through his HAOS PRO program which includes specific skill blocks for:
- **Sled push/pull mechanics** — drilled on Tuesday sessions with interval-based sled work
- **Burpee broad jump efficiency** — practiced for movement economy
- **Wall ball technique** — endurance protocols (e.g., 100 wall balls for time, then building 5-minute leg endurance sets to match)
- **Sandbag carry variations** — including the 120-meter sandbag sprint

His advice for station preparation is practical: "Test one of the workouts, like 100 wall balls for time: if it takes you five minutes, you should be doing something on your legs that's five minutes straight. It's not rocket science" (*Men's Health UK*).

Thursday in his HAOS PRO program is dedicated to **Hyrox Simulation** — race-specific workouts with transition practice and time trials. The program explicitly includes "race simulation" phases in weeks 5–8 of each training block.

---

### 5. Periodization & Peaking

McIntyre's periodization philosophy is blunt: "Just periodisation, man" (*Men's Health UK*). He alternates **endurance blocks with strength blocks**, fully focusing on each in turn rather than trying to train everything simultaneously.

**HAOS PRO Periodization:**

| Phase | Weeks | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1: Base Building | 1–4 | Aerobic capacity, strength foundation, movement quality, work capacity |
| Phase 2: Intensity Development | 5–8 | Lactate threshold, power development, skill refinement, race simulation |
| Phase 3: Peak Performance | 9–12 | Competition preparation, tapering protocols, mental preparation, performance optimization |

Within each phase, the micro-cycle follows a **3 weeks on / 1 week deload** pattern.

His diet is also periodized: "My diet is periodised, so I just got off a week of drinking as much as I could and eating ice cream" (post-season). As he gets further into competition season, "I start cutting out the rib-eye steak. You go towards the leaner cut of meat, or you go to fish and chicken" (*Men's Health UK, 2025*).

---

### 6. Recovery & Lifestyle

**Sleep:** McIntyre is notably unconventional here. He describes himself as "not much of a sleeper," routinely waking at 4 AM regardless of bedtime — whether he goes to bed at 8 PM or midnight (*BarBend interview*). This is an outlier among elite athletes.

**Nutrition:** McIntyre's diet is perhaps the most controversial aspect of his regimen:
- **Daily calorie intake:** 4,500–5,500 calories
- **Macros:** ~90g fat, 400–600g carbs, 180–250g protein
- **Staple foods:** Steak (2–3 per day), chicken, yogurt, maple syrup, honey, fruit, bread, pasta, oatmeal, sweet potatoes, Honey Nut Cheerios, ramen noodles, sticky buns
- **No vegetables.** He has stated: "You can't pay me to eat vegetables… Superheroes aren't made of vegetables, they're made of calories" (*Men's Health UK*). He claims this view was reinforced by sports nutritionist Dr. John Ivey.
- **300–500g of sugar per day:** "Sugar's the shit, I love that stuff" (*BarBend*)
- **Morning ritual:** Strong Coffee (with collagen), BLDR aminos, 3 tablespoons of honey

**Supplements:** He owns his own supplement company, **BLDR Sports**, and takes amino acids daily. He also takes collagen via his coffee brand.

**Post-season recovery:** He takes a deliberate period of debauchery: "I just got off a week of drinking as much as I could and eating ice cream" before ramping strength training back up (*Men's Health UK, 2025*).

---

### 7. Unique/Differentiating Methods

**The Alter Ego / "The Sheriff":** McIntyre uses an alter ego in competition — "The Sheriff." He explains: "You need an alter ego that comes out when necessary" (*Men's Health UK*). He self-talks by "relentlessly bad-mouthing himself, repeating only two or three words so he doesn't get distracted." This deliberate mental warfare extends to intimidating opponents: "I treat this like war. I have tactics, I have strategy, I have mental warfare, I have physical warfare, I'll use guerrilla tactics" (*HYROX podcast appearance, 2021*).

**The Cold Bar Technique:** Performing heavy strength feats without any warm-up — lifting 250 lb stones cold, weighted pull-ups cold — as a grip and neural preparedness tool. No other Hyrox athletes publicly train this way.

**The Lumberjack Workout:** No other elite Hyrox competitor integrates wood chopping, stump moving, and log carries as formal training modalities.

**Single-Speed Cycling:** The "Magnus the Mountain Slayer" bike forces continuous pedaling with no ability to coast, building mental toughness and sustained power output for hours at a time.

**Anti-Vegetable, Pro-Sugar Diet:** At 300–500g of sugar per day with zero vegetable intake, McIntyre's nutrition is arguably the most extreme departure from conventional sports nutrition in elite fitness.

**Pull-Up Contests with Naked Penalties:** He describes having athletes in his training group compete in pull-up contests where "the loser has to run around the neighborhood naked" — a psychological intensity tool (*BarBend interview*).

## Jake Dearden — Elite UK Hyrox Specialist

**Bio snapshot:** Age 26. Hyrox Men's Doubles World Champion (2024, with Marc Dean). Hyrox Master Trainer. Red Bull–sponsored athlete. Former ultramarathon runner (100 km at age 19, 7 marathons in 7 days, 10 marathons in 5 days). Age group world record holder (57:09). Recovered from two slipped discs. Currently pursuing solo Elite 15 World Championship qualification. Sub-2:30 marathon goal.

---

### 1. Training Philosophy & Identity

Jake Dearden's core philosophy can be distilled into one quote: **"Train as much as you can recover from."** He told *Men's Health*: "My job at the moment is to train and become the best at Hyrox. If you're looking at my training and thinking, 'I need to do that amount,' but you've got a full-time job, you've got family and you're only sleeping four hours a night because you've got little kids, it's just not going to work."

Dearden describes himself as "quite boring" with his training. He favors **repeating the same movements week in, week out** so he can track progress objectively. He's deeply analytical and has sought expertise outside of Hyrox — strength coaches, movement coaches, running coaches, physios, and elite ultrarunners like Tom Evans — because he believes "there are no Hyrox experts. You've got to look to other sports, where they've been doing it 40, 50 years" (*Men's Health UK, 2025*).

His approach to Hyrox has evolved significantly. Initially, he focused heavily on running because "there were a lot of professional runners or close-to-professional runners, triathletes and so on, who were coming into the sport and doing really well." After that block, he realized he'd "neglected the strength work," so he pivoted to balance both domains.

He views each Hyrox station **in combination with the subsequent run**: "I always look at the [workout station] and the run as one exercise, so if you're a strength athlete and you're amazing at the sled push, look at your sled push and your running time after as one exercise" (*Men's Health UK*).

---

### 2. Weekly Training Structure

Based on Jake Dearden's Myprotein feature ("Full Week of Training as a HYROX Athlete") and his various interviews, his typical weekly structure is:

| Day | AM Session | PM Session |
|---|---|---|
| **Monday** | 5K progression run | Strength workout |
| **Tuesday** | Strength workout | HYROX session (40–60 min engine-based workout incorporating Hyrox exercises) |
| **Wednesday** | Row intervals (e.g., 10 × 500m with 2 min rest) | — |
| **Thursday** | 10K progression run | Strength workout |
| **Friday** | Rest or active recovery (easy 15K exercise bike, Zone 2) | — |
| **Saturday** | Strength workout + team sweat session | — |
| **Sunday** | HYROX session: 50-minute AMRAP with running and exercises | — |

*(Source: Myprotein article)*

From his YouTube content with Built For Athletes, his training involves approximately **30–40 minutes of intense running** with warm-up and cool-down on either side in morning sessions, with evening sessions focused more on "erg work and practice but still at an intensity where I'm getting my heart rate up" (*"How A 26yr Old RedBull Athlete Is Dominating Fitness," YouTube, 2024*).

Key notes from Dearden himself:
- "Some of these sessions take no more than 30 minutes. I rarely, almost never, spend three hours in the gym in one day."
- He has a flexible schedule allowing AM/PM splits, which he acknowledges isn't possible for most people.
- He emphasizes that his plan is **specific to him** and shouldn't be seen as prescriptive for all athletes.

---

### 3. Session Design Patterns

Dearden uses a mix of **progression runs, interval work, strength sessions, and HYROX-specific AMRAPs.**

His HYROX sessions are 40–60 minute engine-based workouts incorporating Hyrox movements. On Sundays, he does 50-minute AMRAPs that combine running with functional movements.

His rowing intervals follow a classic structure: **10 × 500m with 2 minutes rest** — a bread-and-butter erg conditioning protocol.

He favors **threshold running** as a key training modality, with an emphasis on power-to-weight ratio. From the RMR Training Podcast appearance: his threshold training sessions are structured around sustained efforts at specific paces, with the goal of improving lactate threshold and VO2 max.

He uses **accumulation and intensification phases** within his strength training: "This intensification phase which often happens where the reps start to come down, you start to push it a little bit, because you've been on a leash during the accumulation phase" (*YouTube: "Training With 26yr Old RedBull Athlete Jake Dearden," 2025*).

---

### 4. Hyrox-Specific Preparation

Dearden prioritizes Hyrox stations **in order of race importance.** His hierarchy: "Starting off with your SkiErg – that's the most important exercise. If your heart rate skyrockets at the ski and you struggle, that's going to fatigue you for the rest of the race. But if you get fatigued at the burpees [the fourth station], you've had a good first half of the race" (*Men's Health UK*).

He integrates running with station work **only in the final 5–6 weeks** before a race. Before that, he separates running and strength: "I usually split up my running and my strength until about five to six weeks out from a race. Then I might swap out a couple of sessions so I'm doing some weights and then going straight into running, to practise running under fatigue. That prepares my body. But I think working on your running separately is going to be much more beneficial than trying to do everything fatigued all the time" (*Men's Health UK*).

---

### 5. Periodization & Peaking

Dearden follows a clear **block periodization model** with three phases, as outlined in his Built For Athletes article:

| Timeframe Before Race | Focus |
|---|---|
| **12+ weeks out** | Building a solid base of fitness (running & ergs), building overall strength, progressing all fitness elements |
| **12–6 weeks out** | Add Hyrox-specific exercises, progress to race-day weights, at least 1 Hyrox session per week, focus on muscular endurance and running speed |
| **6–1 weeks out** | Very specific Hyrox exercises and quantities mimicking race day, replicate race-day scenarios, practice technique/tactics, increase Hyrox sessions, trial race-day nutrition |
| **Race week** | Deload: reduced intensity and frequency, rest days approaching race day, ensure nutrition/sleep are optimal |

He learned from ultrarunner Tom Evans that "it was all about what you do in the month prior and how that affects your race" (*Men's Health UK*).

---

### 6. Recovery & Lifestyle

**Recovery as #1 Rule:** Dearden's biggest lesson came from injury — two slipped discs caused by neglecting recovery during his ultramarathon days. "Not prioritising recovery is probably the thing that I regret most" (*Men's Health UK*). He now states that **mobility training is "non-negotiable"** and has called it a "game-changer" in his return to competition (*Wellworthy*).

**Biometric Tracking:** He uses heart rate variability (HRV) and sleep quality data to dictate daily training load. "If the numbers are down, the intensity drops" (*Wellworthy*).

**Nutrition:** Dearden follows a high-protein approach:
- Protein target: **1.7–2.2g per kg of bodyweight per day**
- Prioritizes carbohydrates before training (bagels, porridge oats, rice, bananas)
- 80/20 rule: 80% whole foods, 20% flexible
- Includes healthy fats from animal fats and nuts
- Carb-loads the day before a race

**Supplements:** Caffeine (only before midday during training; unrestricted on race day), creatine daily, electrolytes ("non-negotiable"), and has been testing bicarbonate of soda gels as a lactate buffer.

**Post-race:** Always has a protein shake ready immediately after finishing for recovery advantage. Celebrates with a "nice meal" rather than drinking.

---

### 7. Unique/Differentiating Methods

**Station-Run Coupling Framework:** Dearden's perspective of treating each station + the following run as a single exercise unit is a distinctive analytical framework that informs both his training and race pacing.

**Expert Aggregation Model:** Rather than following a single Hyrox coach, he deliberately consults specialists from disparate sports (ultrarunning, strength and conditioning, movement science, physiotherapy) and synthesizes their advice for Hyrox application. He's stated: "Hyrox hasn't been around for very long. Even though there are Hyrox coaches out there, there are no Hyrox experts" (*Men's Health UK*).

**Late-Stage Integration:** His unique periodization approach of keeping running and strength completely separate until the final 5–6 weeks before a race, then introducing combined "run under fatigue" sessions, contrasts with many Hyrox coaches who advocate mixed-modal training year-round.

**Mental Performance:** Dearden has worked on managing race-day nerves that previously consumed him for two weeks pre-race. After speaking with a sports psychologist, he adopted the principle: "The race is going to happen no matter what, so there's no point thinking about it two weeks beforehand" (*Men's Health UK*). He now focuses on enjoying the lead-up and only "switching on" on race day.

## Dan Churchill — Chef, Hybrid Athlete, Hyrox Content Creator

**Bio snapshot:** Australian-born, NYC-based professional chef and hybrid athlete. Master's degree in Exercise Science. Former strength and conditioning coach for rugby and AFL athletes. Executive chef at The Osprey (1 Hotel Brooklyn). Author of *Eat Like a Legend*. Partner with Centr (Chris Hemsworth's fitness app). Leadville 100 finisher. Currently chasing a sub-60 Hyrox finish. YouTube series documenting his Hyrox journey (@danchurchillcooks).

---

### 1. Training Philosophy & Identity

Dan Churchill represents a uniquely **nutrition-first, multisport hybrid** approach to Hyrox. His background bridges exercise science and professional cooking, giving him a perspective that most Hyrox athletes lack.

His core philosophy: "I grew up playing rugby, and our training was intense—weights, sprints, long efforts, skills. I loved it. Honestly, I loved the training even more than the game. It gave me a solid foundation in programming, which became part of my role as a strength and conditioning coach. I took that philosophy and applied it to the way I now train for Hyrox. It's the same methodology, just refined" (*The Hybrid Letter, 2025*).

Churchill is transparent about **not being a natural speedster:** "I've never seen myself as an elite athlete. I wasn't born with top-end speed, but I've got a great engine—my heart rate and recovery are excellent. Speed, though? Not my strength" (*The Hybrid Letter*). This honesty is central to his content — he documents both "the highs and lows of his journey" (*RXR Sports bio*).

His training philosophy prioritizes three pillars in order: **Sleep, nutrition, and hydration — "those are my big three"** (*The Hybrid Letter*).

---

### 2. Weekly Training Structure

Churchill trains **4–12 sessions per week** depending on the phase, balancing his training with his career as a chef and content creator. His YouTube series provides windows into his actual training days.

Based on his content and interviews, his typical structure during a Hyrox block includes:
- **AM track workouts** (speed sessions, interval running)
- **Midday weight training sessions**
- **HYROX-specific simulation efforts** focused on maintaining Zone 4 heart rate

From his YouTube series (Episode 8, Italy/NYC, 2025): he describes "incorporating simulation efforts to stay in Zone 4, geared towards Hyrox prep" and "crushing a workout session with the team at Meatpacking Athletic."

Churchill's **7-week training block** for the Chicago Hyrox 2024 was documented in Episode 5 of his YouTube series, where he was chasing a sub-60 Hyrox finish. His entry time started at 1:11, improved to 1:08, and his target for Chicago was between 1:07–1:08.

---

### 3. Session Design Patterns

Churchill uses **performance testing as a training design tool.** In Episode 10 of his YouTube series (February 2025), he underwent: blood work to understand his internal state, a heart rate zone test, and a VO2 max assessment. "The day starts with a speed session, followed by a blood test, weight training, a heart rate & VO2 Max test."

He structures workouts around **heart rate zones**, particularly:
- **Zone 2** for aerobic base building
- **Zone 4** for Hyrox-specific simulation work (threshold intensity)

His approach differs from pure Hyrox athletes because he also trains for other endurance events (Leadville 100, Sydney Marathon), requiring periodization across modalities.

---

### 4. Hyrox-Specific Preparation

Churchill's biggest Hyrox lesson was underestimating the running: "I underestimated the running. It's 70% of the event, and I didn't fully factor in how much it would affect fatigue. Going from a run into burpee broad jumps is a different beast. Even though I'm solid at burpees, that transition was brutal" (*The Hybrid Letter*).

He focuses on **learning to "ride out Zone 4 and get back into rhythm"** — the ability to sustain threshold-level effort through station transitions and back into running.

His content with Hunter McIntyre (YouTube Episode 2: "Day In The Life Of A Professional Chef and Hybrid Athlete | Hyrox Training W/ McIntyre") shows him training directly alongside McIntyre, absorbing elite-level Hyrox session design.

---

### 5. Periodization & Peaking

Churchill structures his Hyrox prep in training blocks. His Chicago 2024 prep was a focused **7-week training block**. For his World Championships qualification (YouTube Episode 1, November 2025), he documented the beginning of a new dedicated prep block.

He has stated that "Leadville last year taught me the value of preparation. It's about putting in the reps and improving 1% every day" (*The Hybrid Letter*). His long-term trajectory shows a deliberate, multi-year build toward his sub-60 goal rather than a single peak cycle.

---

### 6. Recovery & Lifestyle

**Nutrition — Churchill's Superpower:** As a professional chef with a Master's in Exercise Science, his nutrition approach is arguably the most sophisticated of any Hyrox athlete:
- He focuses on **meal timing** — the right macros at the right time relative to training
- Has increased caloric intake after realizing "I used to just eat a banana before training—maybe 30 grams of carbs—but I didn't account for how much I was burning, even in Zone 2" (*The Hybrid Letter*)
- Added **fish oil regularly** for omega-3s
- Uses **Complex G1 from BPN** for additional carbs
- Increased **Vitamin D3** (through AG1)
- Reduces dietary fat around workouts for quicker energy access
- Avoids dense protein and high-fat meals within 2 hours of sleep

**Sleep:** Churchill uses a **Whoop strap** and has noted that three months of poor sleep visibly impacted his hormones, Zone 2 heart rate, and recovery. He emphasizes the importance of **REM and deep sleep** specifically, not just time in bed. He recommends finishing eating at least 2 hours before sleep and avoiding insulin-spiking carbs before bed.

**Hydration:** Listed as one of his "big three" alongside sleep and nutrition.

**Supplement Protocol:**
- AG1 (for Vitamin D3 and micronutrients)
- Fish oil (omega-3)
- Complex G1 from BPN (carbohydrate supplement)
- Whoop strap for biometric recovery tracking

---

### 7. Unique/Differentiating Methods

**Chef-Athlete Dual Identity:** Churchill is the only elite-level Hyrox content creator who is simultaneously a professional chef. His recipe-creation for athletes — bridging the gap between nutritionist recommendations and practical cooking — is genuinely unique. He created athlete-friendly recipes for rugby players early in his career and applies the same approach to hybrid athletes.

**Micronutrient Focus:** He refers to micronutrients as "the fifth macronutrient" — an unusual level of attention to vitamins and minerals among Hyrox athletes who typically focus only on protein, carbs, and fats.

**Science-Backed Content:** His Master's in Exercise Science gives his training and nutrition advice a research foundation that most Hyrox athlete-influencers lack. He writes the *Legendary* newsletter sharing "science-backed, actionable insights on nutrition, performance, and recovery."

**Multi-Endurance Background:** Having completed the Leadville 100 ultramarathon, a Sydney Marathon, and pursuing sub-60 Hyrox simultaneously, Churchill brings a cross-endurance perspective. His aerobic engine is built from ultra-distance work, which he applies to Hyrox's shorter but more intense demands.

**Transparency in the Process:** Churchill documents his blood work, VO2 max testing, and performance metrics publicly. This data-driven transparency — including sharing actual numbers and setbacks — is more granular than what most Hyrox athletes reveal.

## Jason Khalipa — CrossFit Games Champion Crossing Into Hyrox

**Bio snapshot:** 2008 CrossFit Games Individual Champion. 3× Team USA CrossFit member. Founder and CEO of NCFIT gyms and TRAIN HARD online training. Author of *As Many Reps As Possible*. Host of the Jason Khalipa Podcast (formerly "Effort Over Everything"). Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu brown belt. Pediatric cancer advocate. Competed in HYROX Dallas Pro Doubles (2024) with partner Gabe Yanez.

---

### 1. Training Philosophy & Identity

Jason Khalipa's training philosophy is defined by what he calls the **AMRAP Mentality** — extended beyond the gym into a life philosophy. In his book *As Many Reps As Possible*, he outlines five core principles:

1. **Know your WHY** — use your purpose to fuel your effort
2. **Focus on what you can control**
3. **Work hard**
4. **Switch gears** — be fully present in each task
5. **Re-evaluate** — adjust priorities as life changes

*(Source: Goodreads / Mark Bell's PowerCast #200)*

He's described the AMRAP mentality as: "Taking as many 'reps' as possible of the task in front of you, giving it your best, and then moving on to the next task, and repeat" (*Mark Bell's PowerCast*).

Khalipa's approach to fitness is **pragmatic and time-efficient.** Having transitioned from elite-level CrossFit competition to running businesses, raising a family, and training BJJ, he now prioritizes "protectors and providers" — people with limited training hours who need maximum fitness return on investment. His TRAIN HARD platform is built around this ethos.

His first experience with Hyrox was documented in a three-part YouTube series ("Training for HYROX," November–December 2024) where he and Gabe Yanez competed in the Pro Doubles division at HYROX Dallas. The first episode was titled "CrossFit Games Champion **Humbled** By HYROX" — indicating the learning curve even for a CrossFit legend.

---

### 2. Weekly Training Structure

Khalipa's current weekly structure (outside of specific Hyrox prep) includes:

| Time Slot | Activity |
|---|---|
| Early AM | Cardio and/or ruck walks |
| Midday | NCFIT workout (NCX track — includes strength + WOD) |
| Various (3×/week) | Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu |
| Active recovery | Long walks (daily minimum) |

*(Source: T-Nation AMA, 2024)*

He describes his approach: "I train BJJ 3× a week and do our NCFIT workouts daily. I also typically do early AM cardio and/or ruck walks to start the day. If I feel super fatigued, I'll try and reduce the volume. However, doing nothing isn't something I really ever do. I'll at a minimum go for a long walk" (*T-Nation AMA*).

**During his professional CrossFit career,** his daily structure was more intensive and divided into three distinct blocks:
- **AM:** Cardio
- **Midday:** CrossFit (couplets, triplets, and for-time workouts)
- **Evening:** Stamina building on gymnastic movements (e.g., 10-minute EMOM of 10 strict pull-ups)

*(Source: T-Nation AMA)*

For Hyrox-specific preparation, he worked with legendary endurance coach **Chris

## Original Prompt

```
You are a research analyst studying the training methods of elite Hyrox athletes
to build an AI coaching knowledge base.

Research the following athletes in depth. For EACH athlete, document:

### Athletes to Research

**Tier 1 — Elite Hyrox Specialists:**
- Hunter McIntyre (multiple Hyrox world champion, "King of Hyrox")
- Jake Dearden (Elite UK Hyrox competitor)
- Dan Churchill (chef/athlete, Hyrox competitor and content creator)

**Tier 2 — CrossFit Legends Crossing Into Hyrox/Endurance:**
- Jason Khalipa (CrossFit Games champion, known for "AMRAP mentality")
- Rich Froning (winningest CrossFit athlete ever, team/individual)

For each athlete, research and document:

1. **Training Philosophy & Identity**
   - Core training beliefs and principles
   - How they describe their own approach
   - What makes their method unique vs. others

2. **Weekly Training Structure**
   - Typical weekly split (how many sessions, what type)
   - How they balance running/cardio vs. strength vs. skill work
   - Volume and intensity distribution
   - Do they follow a specific program or self-program?

3. **Session Design Patterns**
   - Favorite workout formats (EMOM, AMRAP, intervals, time trials, etc.)
   - Example workouts they've shared publicly
   - How they structure warm-ups and cooldowns
   - Use of Hyrox-specific simulation workouts

4. **Hyrox-Specific Preparation**
   - How they train for each station
   - Sled work programming
   - SkiErg/Rower interval strategies
   - Wall ball endurance protocols
   - How they integrate running with station work

5. **Periodization & Peaking**
   - How they structure a training block leading into a race
   - Taper strategy
   - Off-season vs. competition-season differences
   - How far out they start Hyrox-specific prep

6. **Recovery & Lifestyle**
   - Recovery modalities used
   - Nutrition approach (general philosophy)
   - Sleep priorities
   - Supplement protocols if publicly shared

7. **Unique/Differentiating Methods**
   - What do they do that NOBODY else does?
   - Any unconventional training tools or techniques
   - Mental performance strategies

**Special focus for Hunter McIntyre**: He has been the most vocal and documented
Hyrox athlete. Dig into his podcast appearances, YouTube content, and any
published training guides or programs he's released.

**Special focus for Khalipa & Froning**: Their CrossFit background gives them a
unique hybrid fitness perspective. Focus on how their general physical
preparedness (GPP) approach translates to Hyrox demands, and any specific
Hyrox content they've produced.

IMPORTANT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Length: This must be a LONG, EXHAUSTIVE document — at minimum 4,000-6,000 words total across all athlete profiles. Do not summarize. Each athlete should get a full, detailed profile.
- Format: Use structured markdown with H2 for each athlete, H3 for subsections, markdown tables for weekly schedules and training splits.
- Include direct quotes where available, with source attribution inline (e.g., podcast name, YouTube video title).
- Be specific: Include actual workout prescriptions, rep schemes, paces, loads, session durations — not vague descriptions.
- This content will be chunked and embedded into a vector database for semantic search, so write in natural language that matches queries like "how does Hunter McIntyre train for sled push" or "what does Rich Froning's weekly training look like."
- If information for a specific athlete/subsection is genuinely unavailable, say so explicitly rather than fabricating details.
```
