# HYROX Equipment Knowledge Base — Verified Guidance for AI Coach v2

> **Document Purpose:** This knowledge base corrects the dangerous equipment recommendations made by the v1 AI coach model (which recommended Nike Vaporfly Next% as the "#1 Hyrox shoe") and provides verified, source-backed equipment guidance for Hyrox athletes.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL CORRECTION: The Vaporfly Error

**What the v1 model claimed:** "Nike Vaporfly Next% is the #1 Hyrox shoe with 4%+ VO2max improvement from the carbon plate."

**What the research actually shows:**
- The ~4% figure refers to a reduction in **metabolic cost of running** (energy cost in watts/kg), **NOT** a VO2max improvement. The original 2017 University of Colorado study by Hoogkamer et al. measured that "averaged over three speeds, the Vaporfly's metabolic cost was 4.0 percent lower" than control shoes. Individual results ranged from 1.59% to 6.26%. *(Source: Runner's World reporting on Hoogkamer et al., Sports Medicine, 2017; PMC peer-reviewed study PMC9189709)*
- VO2max is a physiological ceiling — no shoe changes it. The shoe reduces the energy cost of running at a given speed, which is a completely different metric.
- This benefit applies **only to straight-line running on flat surfaces**. It provides zero benefit during functional fitness stations, and active detriment on several.

**Why Vaporfly/Alphafly are DANGEROUS for Hyrox:**

| Risk Factor | Explanation | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Zero lateral stability** | 40mm stack height with narrow platform creates ankle injury risk during lunges, burpee broad jumps, and sled work | RunRepeat lab testing; Muscle & Fitness Hyrox guide |
| **No grip on sled surfaces** | Minimal outsole rubber — companies "minimise the amount the shoe weighs by sacrificing rubber on the outsole" | RoxLyfe footwear guide |
| **Carbon plate fragility** | Carbon plates are designed for forward propulsion only; lateral loading and ground contact during burpees can damage the plate | Multiple coaching sources |
| **Shoe destruction** | Super shoes are not designed for the abrasion of convention center floors, sled turf, and burpee ground contact — expect significant damage in one race | RunRepeat toebox durability testing |
| **Rower interference** | High stack height shoes have difficulty fitting into Concept2 rower heel cups, costing seconds per transition | RunRepeat Hyrox shoe guide |
| **Lunge depth issues** | Higher stack means your knee must travel further to touch the ground during sandbag lunges — reps may not count | RunRepeat: "choosing shoes with 40+ mm heel stack...making it harder for some reps to count" |
| **$200-$250 cost wasted** | Racing flats designed for 1-2 road races cannot survive Hyrox station demands | General pricing data |

## 1. FOOTWEAR FOR HYROX

### 1.1 The Hyrox Shoe Problem

Hyrox is uniquely challenging for footwear because athletes must perform two fundamentally opposed activities in the same shoe:

**Running demands (8km total):** Cushioning, energy return, lightweight, responsive midsole, forward-propulsion geometry
**Station demands (8 functional exercises):** Grip on carpet/turf, lateral stability, low-to-ground connection, durability against abrasion, flexibility for squats/lunges, ability to fit into rower foot plates

As Hyrox performance coach Jacob Ruch (CSCS) stated: *"HYROX is a running race accumulating 5+ miles; comfort, stability, and then grip, in that order, should drive your shoe choice."* *(Source: Muscle & Fitness)*

**The 5 Key Properties for a Hyrox Shoe:**

1. **Grip/Traction** — Primarily for sled push (your feet slip on the Centr x HYROX Perform Turf surface), sled pull, and wet venue floors. Look for textured rubber outsoles with moderate lugs. *(Source: RunRepeat, RoxLyfe)*
2. **Cushioning** — Moderate stack height (30-38mm heel recommended). Enough to handle 8km of running without destroying your legs, but not so much you lose ground feel. *(Source: RunRepeat, Centr)*
3. **Lateral Stability** — A wide base and firm midsole for lunges, burpee broad jumps, and sled work. Torsional rigidity of at least 3/5 is ideal. *(Source: RunRepeat lab testing)*
4. **Durability** — Convention center surfaces, burpee ground contact, and sled turf are brutal on shoes. The toebox and heel padding must withstand abrasion. *(Source: RunRepeat durability testing)*
5. **Heel shape/fit** — Must fit into Concept2 rower heel cups without wasting time. Avoid shoes with flared or unconventional heel designs. Also needs a strong heel counter to prevent slippage during sled pushes. *(Source: RunRepeat, RoxLyfe)*

### 1.2 What the Top Athletes Actually Wear

Based on direct athlete reporting from RoxLyfe (competitive athlete survey, updated 2025):

| Athlete | Achievement | Shoe |
|---|---|---|
| Linda Meier | 2025 World Champion (Women) | Puma Deviate Nitro 3 Elite |
| Tim Wenisch | 2025 World Champion (Men) | Adidas (prototype) |
| Hunter McIntyre | Elite competitor | Puma Deviate Nitro 3 |
| Megan Jacoby | Elite competitor | Puma Deviate Nitro 3 Elite |
| Lauren Weeks | Elite competitor | Mizuno Wave Rebellion Pro |
| Kate Davey | Elite competitor | Saucony Endorphin Pro |
| Alexander Roncevic | Elite competitor | ON Cloudboom Echo 3 |
| Joanna Wietrzyk | Elite competitor | Puma Deviate Nitro 3 |
| James Kelly | Elite competitor | Puma Deviate Nitro 2 Elite |

**Key insight:** Elite athletes overwhelmingly favor **running-biased shoes with adequate grip**, NOT cross-trainers. Puma Deviate Nitro models dominate at the elite level, partly because Puma is the official HYROX sponsor, but also because the shoe's PUMAGRIP outsole provides genuine traction on sled surfaces while maintaining race-level running performance.

A Resilience Fitness community survey (45 athletes) found Puma Deviate Nitro 3 and Deviate Nitro Elite 3 made up ~40% of all shoe choices. *(Source: Resilience Fitness Hyrox Gear Guide 2025)*

**Critical distinction for the AI coach:** The shoe recommendation should differ based on the athlete's level and priorities. Elites choose running-fast shoes because they have the strength to handle stations regardless. Beginners and intermediate athletes often benefit more from hybrid options that provide stability across all stations.

### 1.3 Specific Shoe Recommendations

#### CATEGORY A: Running-Biased Shoes (Prioritize 8km speed, adequate station performance)

**Puma Deviate Nitro 3 / Deviate Nitro 3 Elite / Deviate Nitro Elite HYROX**
- **Price:** ~$170-$200 (Elite ~$220-250)
- **Stack:** ~36-39mm heel
- **Drop:** ~8-10mm
- **Pros for Hyrox:** Best-in-class PUMAGRIP outsole for sled work; NITROFOAM Elite provides excellent energy return; carbon/nylon PWRPLATE for propulsion; the official HYROX x Puma shoe (launching Feb 19, 2026) was designed specifically for the sport with a "full-coverage, high traction PUMAGRIP outsole" and "specially engineered lug pattern." *(Sources: RoxLyfe, Men's Health, RunRepeat)*
- **Cons for Hyrox:** Narrow platform; high stack can feel less stable on lunges; not the most planted shoe for lateral work; potential fit issues for wide feet *(Source: RunRepeat, Muscle & Fitness)*
- **Best for:** Competitive athletes (sub-75 min) who prioritize run splits; anyone comfortable with the slightly-less-stable platform during stations
- **Elite athlete endorsement:** Worn by both 2025 World Champions and the majority of the Elite 15 field

**Saucony Endorphin Speed 5 (nylon plate — NOT the carbon-plated Pro)**
- **Price:** ~$160-$170
- **Pros for Hyrox:** Top-level PWRRUN PB foam; nylon plate (more flexible than carbon); excellent energy return (RunRepeat: 132 SA heel shock absorption, 71.6% heel energy return); SPEEDROLL geometry for smooth transitions *(Source: RunRepeat)*
- **Cons for Hyrox:** Toebox durability concerns (failed RunRepeat durability test); less grip than Puma models
- **Best for:** Runner-dominant athletes who want a speed shoe with better flexibility than a pure carbon racer

**Saucony Endorphin Pro 4 (carbon plate — use with awareness)**
- **Price:** ~$200-$240
- **Pros for Hyrox:** PWRRUN HG foam + carbon plate = propulsive ride; broader forefoot platform than many super shoes; reinforced outsole rubber provides decent grip for sled work *(Source: RoxLyfe)*
- **Cons for Hyrox:** Carbon plate reduces forefoot flexibility for lunges; too unstable for lateral/loaded movements per Muscle & Fitness testing; narrow platform
- **Best for:** Advanced/elite athletes who are confident in their station strength and want maximum run speed. Multiple elite athletes (Kate Davey, Vivian Tafuto, Jon Wynn) race in these. *(Source: RoxLyfe)*
- **⚠️ AI coach note:** This is a legitimate choice for strong athletes, unlike the Vaporfly. The Endorphin Pro has more outsole rubber, a wider forefoot, and better grip than the Vaporfly. However, it is still a compromise — recommend only to experienced athletes who have tested it on sleds.

**Hoka Mach 6**
- **Price:** ~$140
- **Pros for Hyrox:** RunRepeat rates it the most stable among Hyrox running shoes; high 4/5 torsional rigidity despite plush cushioning; 67.5% heel energy return, 74.2% forefoot energy return; responsive and lightweight *(Source: RunRepeat)*
- **Cons for Hyrox:** Snug toebox (issue for wide feet); narrower fit
- **Best for:** Stability-conscious runners who want running performance without sacrificing too much ground feel

**Nike Pegasus 41**
- **Price:** ~$130-$140
- **Pros for Hyrox:** Great all-around daily trainer; ZoomX and ReactX foams for cushioning; waffle-shaped outsole provides decent traction; very accessible entry-level option; good stability for a running shoe *(Source: Men's Health, Muscle & Fitness)*
- **Cons for Hyrox:** Soft midsole reduces stability under load; limited grip compared to Puma models; not the fastest
- **Best for:** First-timers who already own Pegasus; budget-conscious athletes wanting a versatile option

**Adidas Adizero Boston 12**
- **Price:** ~$140-$160
- **Pros for Hyrox:** Light, versatile, speed-oriented; Continental rubber outsole (excellent grip and durability); wider forefoot; layered foam midsole for stability *(Source: Men's Health)*
- **Cons for Hyrox:** Still running-biased — less lateral support than training shoes
- **Best for:** Athletes wanting a fast shoe with genuinely good outsole grip

**On Cloud X 4 / On Cloudflow**
- **Price:** ~$140-$160
- **Pros for Hyrox:** On Cloudmonster praised for "cushion for the runs, control for sled work" by Resilience Fitness coaches; Cloud X is designed as a hybrid training/running shoe; lightweight and responsive *(Source: Resilience Fitness)*
- **Cons for Hyrox:** CloudTec pods can feel unusual; limited lateral support; grip concerns on turf surfaces; the Cloudflow is better for running but worse for stations
- **Best for:** Runner-dominant athletes who prefer On's ride feel and have tested them on sleds

#### CATEGORY B: Cross-Training / Hybrid Shoes (Prioritize station performance, adequate running)

**Nike Metcon 9 / Metcon 10**
- **Price:** $150-$155
- **Weight:** 11.0 oz / 312g (Metcon 10, men's 9)
- **Stack:** 22.8mm heel / 16.2mm forefoot
- **Drop:** 6.6mm (Metcon 10)
- **Pros for Hyrox:** "Rock-solid" stability for sled work, lunges, and wall balls; wide forefoot base (115.2mm); excellent grip on gym/indoor floors; extremely durable upper; Hyperlift plate for heavy lifting; Metcon 10 has improved ReactX foam for better energy return (63% heel) than previous versions *(Sources: RunRepeat, Muscle & Fitness, multiple reviews)*
- **Cons for Hyrox:** **Very limited running comfort beyond ~1km at a time.** The Hyperlift plate makes heel striking painful; low stack means insufficient cushioning for 8km of running; "Not the most comfortable but it can work for like one to three miles." The Metcon 10 review from ThatFitFriend states running distances should be kept under 1,200m at a time. *(Sources: RunRepeat, ThatFitFriend, RoxLyfe)*
- **Best for:** Strength-dominant athletes who are slow runners anyway and want maximum station performance; athletes whose race will take 90+ minutes where station efficiency matters more than run speed
- **⚠️ AI coach note:** RoxLyfe explicitly states "CrossFit shoes – like the Puma Fuse or Nike Metcon's – aren't appropriate for HYROX" due to running discomfort. However, some athletes do use them successfully, especially those prioritizing stations. Be transparent about the tradeoff.

**Nike Free Metcon 6**
- **Price:** ~$125
- **Weight:** 274g (men's)
- **Stack:** 22mm heel / 14.8mm forefoot
- **Drop:** 7.2mm
- **Pros for Hyrox:** "Combines flexibility with structure"; snug fit and firm platform for multi-directional movements; cheaper than Metcon 10; more flexible than standard Metcon *(Source: Muscle & Fitness)*
- **Cons for Hyrox:** Minimal cushioning; "less ideal for distances over 800 meters of running"; tighter build
- **Best for:** Budget-conscious athletes who want a gym-friendly shoe and accept slower run splits

**Reebok Nano X4 / Nano X5**
- **Price:** ~$135-$140
- **Pros for Hyrox:** Stable heel and wide forefoot; rugged outsole with excellent traction; breathable upper; strong all-around CrossFit shoe; good hybrid function *(Source: Muscle & Fitness, multiple reviews)*
- **Cons for Hyrox:** "On the heavier side for running"; "stiff during toe-off"; running comfort decreases notably after the first few kilometers
- **Best for:** CrossFit athletes transitioning to Hyrox who already own Nanos; strength-dominant competitors

**TYR CXT-1 Trainer**
- **Price:** ~$140-$160
- **Weight:** ~348g
- **Drop:** 9mm heel-to-toe
- **Pros for Hyrox:** Rated "Best Overall" by one review for balanced run + strength; Surge NRG foam dual midsole for energy return; "incredibly solid base" with patent-pending stability platform; excellent grip on various gym surfaces including turf; wider toe box for natural toe splay; 9mm drop provides a slight lift helpful for squat depth *(Sources: TYR CXT-1 video review, Aqil Fitness)*
- **Cons for Hyrox:** Break-in period can feel stiff; premium pricing; less cushioning than running shoes for 8km; relatively new brand in the space
- **Best for:** Functional fitness athletes wanting the most versatile single shoe for both training and racing; athletes with mobility limitations who benefit from the 9mm drop

**NOBULL Trainer / NOBULL Runner+**
- **Price:** ~$130-$160
- **Pros for Hyrox:** Wider toe box; grippy outsole; minimal drop for ground control; extremely durable — "feels like armor for your feet during lunges and carries" *(Source: Aqil Fitness)*
- **Cons for Hyrox:** Heavier than most options; firm ride; not ideal for runners who need cushioning; the Trainer is very much a gym shoe
- **Best for:** Athletes who value durability and don't mind sacrificing some running comfort; the Runner+ model is slightly more running-capable

**Puma Fuse 2.0 / Fuse 3.0**
- **Price:** $100-$120
- **Pros for Hyrox:** Excellent PUMAGRIP outsole; very stable for lifting; budget-friendly; Fuse 2.0 praised for superior comfort *(Source: Coach Web, WearTesters, ThatFitFriend)*
- **Cons for Hyrox:** **Not recommended for Hyrox racing.** "The Puma Fuse 3.0 does not excel at cardio... cushion just stops being effective after 100 meters or so." The Fuse 3.0 weighs 454g (heavy); narrow toebox; clunky heel. RoxLyfe explicitly advises against Fuse shoes for Hyrox racing. *(Sources: WearTesters, Coach Web, RoxLyfe)*
- **Best for:** Hyrox training sessions focused on station work ONLY, not race day; budget training shoe

**GORUCK Ballistic Trainer**
- **Price:** ~$135-$165
- **Pros for Hyrox:** Breathable; flexible from ball of foot to toe; good midsole rigidity; high-density EVA midsole; durable construction designed for rucking and training *(Source: GORUCK review videos)*
- **Cons for Hyrox:** Limited availability; less established in Hyrox community; heavier than running shoes
- **Best for:** Military/rucking athletes crossing into Hyrox; athletes who want extreme durability

**Under Armour TriBase Reign**
- **Price:** ~$100-$140
- **Pros for Hyrox:** Low-cut and lightweight; excels in agility work; Micro G Foam midsole for responsive ground strikes; good for jumping and dynamic movements *(Source: UA TriBase Reign review)*
- **Cons for Hyrox:** Less cushioning than running shoes; less proven in Hyrox community; grip not as tested on sled surfaces
- **Best for:** Budget-conscious athletes; training shoe for Hyrox prep workouts

### 1.4 Shoe Selection by Athlete Type

**Runner-Dominant Athlete** (strong cardio, weaker stations, likely finishing 65-85 min):
- **Prioritize:** Energy return, lightweight, cushioning for 8km
- **Top picks:** Puma Deviate Nitro 3 (Elite), Saucony Endorphin Speed 5, Adidas Adizero Boston 12
- **Logic:** Your run splits are your weapon. A shoe that costs you 10-15 seconds per km over 8km = 80-120 seconds total. Station time differences between shoe types are smaller (~5-15 seconds per station for most athletes).

**Strength-Dominant Athlete** (strong stations, weaker running, likely finishing 80-100+ min):
- **Prioritize:** Grip, stability, comfort over longer duration
- **Top picks:** Nike Pegasus 41, Hoka Mach 6, TYR CXT-1
- **Logic:** Your stations are already fast. You need a shoe comfortable enough to keep your running legs working across 8km. Don't sacrifice 2+ minutes on running splits to gain 15 seconds on sled push grip.

**First-Timer** (finishing 85-120+ min):
- **Prioritize:** Comfort, stability, grip — in that order. Don't overthink it.
- **Top picks:** Nike Pegasus 41 (if you own running shoes), TYR CXT-1 or Reebok Nano X4 (if you come from CrossFit)
- **Key advice:** "Wear the shoes you've trained in." *(Source: Wheelhouse Academy, RoxLyfe)* Breaking in new shoes on race day = blisters and distraction. Test on a heavy sled push before race day.
- **Budget option:** Brooks Ghost 17 (~$140) — "Well-cushioned and stable enough for beginner hybrid workouts at a lower price point" *(Source: Muscle & Fitness)*

**Experienced Competitor** (sub-75 min, targeting podium/worlds qualification):
- **Top picks:** Puma Deviate Nitro Elite HYROX (when available), Puma Deviate Nitro 3 Elite, Saucony Endorphin Pro 4
- **Strategy:** At this level, you likely know your feet and your weaknesses. Some elite athletes even use a two-shoe strategy (starting in running shoes, switching at a station) though this is rare and adds transition time.

### 1.5 What NOT to Wear — and Exactly Why

**❌ Carbon-Plate Racing Flats (Nike Vaporfly, Nike Alphafly, Saucony Endorphin Pro in the wrong hands)**
- 40mm+ stack height with narrow platform = ankle injury risk during lateral movements
- Minimal outsole rubber = feet slip on sled push/pull carpet surface
- Carbon plate is rigid = significantly reduces forefoot flexibility needed for lunges and burpees (some carbon shoes measured at 25N stiffness vs. 13N average for Hyrox shoes) *(Source: RunRepeat)*
- Shoe designed for 1-2 road races = will be destroyed by convention center floors and sled turf
- $200-$275 cost = wasted on a shoe that can't do half the race
- The energy return benefit only helps on 8km of running, and is partially or fully negated by time lost on stations
- As one Hyrox video creator stated: "Is the 2-3% return that you get from these shoes, does that actually outweigh the grip where a minute on the sleds can cook you? It does not." *(Source: YouTube carbon plate Hyrox analysis)*
- **Exception:** The Saucony Endorphin Pro 4 and Puma Deviate Nitro Elite occupy a middle ground — they have carbon/nylon plates but also better outsole coverage and stability. These are used by elite athletes who understand the tradeoff. The AI coach should **never** recommend Vaporfly or Alphafly but may cautiously recommend Deviate Nitro Elite or Endorphin Pro to advanced athletes who have tested them.

**❌ Minimalist/Barefoot Shoes (Vibram FiveFingers, Xero Shoes, Vivobarefoot)**
- Zero cushioning for 8km of running on hard convention center floors = high impact stress, metatarsal pain
- No support structure = injury risk under loaded movements (sled push at 102-202kg)
- No grip features designed for sled turf
- **Training note:** One Hyrox athlete actually trained 60 days in Vivobarefoot shoes to build foot strength, then raced in carbon-plated shoes — seeing significant performance improvement. Barefoot shoes have a role in *training*, not racing. *(Source: YouTube training video)*

**❌ Heavy Lifting Shoes (Nike Romaleos, Adidas Adipower, Reebok Legacy Lifter)**
- Raised rigid heel designed for Olympic lifts = terrible for running
- Very heavy (typically 400-500g+)
- Rigid sole provides zero energy return for running
- Elevated heel changes running biomechanics dangerously over 8km
- No shock absorption

**❌ Old/Worn-Out Shoes**
- Compressed midsole = reduced cushioning and energy return
- Worn outsole = dramatically reduced grip on sled surfaces
- Stretched upper = reduced lateral support and heel lockdown
- As a general rule: if you can see smooth patches on your outsole, the shoe has lost meaningful grip

**❌ Trail Running Shoes (Salomon Speedcross, Hoka Speedgoat, etc.)**
- Aggressive lugs designed for mud/dirt = unnecessary on indoor surfaces and can feel unstable on flat floors
- Typically heavier than road shoes
- Rock plates and aggressive tread patterns reduce flexibility for lunges and squats
- Often have higher stack heights designed for uneven terrain

## 2. RACE DAY GEAR

### 2.1 Official Hyrox Rules — Equipment (Season 2025/2026)

**Source:** HYROX EN Single Rulebook 25/26, directly from hyrox.com

#### Permitted Items (Section 11.1):
The following may be used/worn during the race:
1. Knee Sleeves
2. **Gloves (not grips)** — Note the distinction: gloves are permitted, grips are NOT
3. Weightlifting Belt
4. Wristbands
5. Hydration Packs
6. Asthma inhalers or similar prescribed respiratory devices
7. **Closed-toe shoes required at all times** — except at Wall Balls where racers may remove shoes

**Critical rule:** *"If a racer chooses to use, wear or carry any of the above items, they must do so from the start to the finish of their race. These items may not be handed to or received from anyone else at any point. Doing so constitutes outside assistance and may result in disqualification."*

**Also critical:** *"Any item NOT listed above should be considered prohibited unless the racer receives written permission from the Race Director prior to race start."*

#### Forbidden Items (Section 11.2):
1. Headphones
2. Cell Phones (exception: medical devices requiring phone proximity, with prior Race Director approval)
3. VR Headsets
4. GoPro or any type/brand of body cameras
5. Helmets
6. Breathing apparatus
7. Compressed air cylinders

#### Equipment at Stations:
**All station equipment is provided by Hyrox.** Athletes do NOT bring their own:
- SkiErg machines (preset to Resistance 6, adjustable by racer)
- Sleds and weight plates
- Rowing machines (preset to Resistance 6, footplates preset to Position 4, both adjustable)
- Kettlebells (color-coded by weight/division: White=16kg, Grey=24kg, Black=32kg)
- Sandbags (color-coded: White=10kg, Grey=20kg, Black=30kg)
- Wall balls (color-coded: White=4kg, Grey=6kg, Black=9kg)
- Burpee broad jump lanes

**Athletes are assigned equipment/lanes by judges.** You cannot choose your own lane, sled, rower, or wall ball station. *(Section 9, rulebook)*

#### Chalk Rules (VERY SPECIFIC — Section 8.1, Rule 8 + Penalty Code 16):
- *"Only event-provided chalk may be used, and only at the workout stations where it is provided."*
- Chalk may NOT be taken to other workout stations or used at different stations
- **Using chalk anywhere but Sled Pull and Farmers Carry = 2-minute penalty per infringement**
- Using powdered chalk at Wall Balls specifically = 2-minute penalty
- **You CANNOT bring your own chalk** (it is not on the "permitted items" list, and any unlisted item is prohibited by default)
- At the 2025 World Championships in Chicago, the event ran out of chalk for some athletes *(Source: The Rox Guys)*

#### Hydration/Nutrition Rules (Section 11.5):
- Water available at aid stations at least once during, before, or after each pass through the Roxzone (you pass through ~8 times)
- Sports drinks may also be available
- **Any racer who wants nutrition (gels, etc.) must carry it on their person from the start**
- Racers may NOT receive beverages or nutrition from anyone except aid stations (= outside assistance, 3-minute penalty per infringement)
- Aid station fluids are **for drinking only** — pouring water on head/body for cooling = 2-minute penalty
- **Hydration packs are permitted** (listed in Section 11.1)

#### Jump Rope?
- NOT listed as a permitted item, and NOT relevant — there is no jump rope station in Hyrox

### 2.2 Gloves

**Do experienced athletes use gloves?**

This is an evolving topic in the Hyrox community. Historically, most elite athletes used chalk or bare hands. However, lightweight purpose-built Hyrox gloves are gaining traction.

**The case FOR gloves:**
- Eliminates the "chalk penalty" — The Rox Guys calculated that stopping to apply chalk before 3+ stations costs ~22.5 seconds per race (3 stations × 7.5 seconds/station). That's a meaningful amount of time, especially at elite levels. *(Source: The Rox Guys data analysis)*
- Consistent grip regardless of chalk availability — chalk ran out at the 2025 World Championships
- No transition friction — put them on at the start, don't think about them again
- Reduce mental load — "remove that entire stream of worry" about grip slipping *(Source: The Rox Guys)*
- Protect hands from shared equipment used by thousands of athletes over a race weekend
- Cushion during burpees (palm contact with ground)
- Permitted by the rulebook (Section 11.1: "Gloves (not grips)")

**The case AGAINST gloves:**
- Bulky weightlifting gloves are too hot and padded, reducing tactile feedback
- Can bunch up or shift during wall ball catches
- Traditional gym gloves cover the wrist, interfering with watch/heart rate monitor
- Some athletes feel they reduce the "connection" to the equipment

**Best glove characteristics for Hyrox:**
- **Lightweight and breathable** — not traditional bulky weightlifting gloves
- **Minimal padding** — the goal is consistent grip, not hand cushioning
- **Open wrist design** — to accommodate fitness trackers/watches
- **Fingerless or thin full-finger** — some athletes prefer fingerless for wall ball feel
- Purpose-built Hyrox gloves (e.g., The Rox Guys gloves) are designed for these specific needs

**Recommended approach:**
- Off-season / training: Go bare-handed or use chalk to build raw grip strength
- Pre-competition / race day: Use lightweight performance gloves you've trained in *(Source: The Rox Guys strategic approach)*
- **Never race in gloves you haven't trained in**

**Stations where gloves help most:**
1. Sled Pull (rope grip under sweaty conditions)
2. Farmers Carry (200m with heavy kettlebells — grip endurance)
3. Wall Balls (catching sweaty ball after 100 reps)
4. SkiErg (handle grip under fatigue)
5. Rowing (handle grip)

### 2.3 Chalk

**Is chalk allowed?** Yes, but with strict limitations:
- **Only event-provided chalk** — you cannot bring your own (it's not on the permitted items list)
- **Only at stations where it is provided** — Sled Pull and Farmers Carry
- Using chalk at any other station (including Wall Balls) = **2-minute penalty**
- You may NOT take chalk from one station to another

**Practical implications:**
- Chalk is provided in a communal bucket/bowl before Sled Pull and Farmers Carry stations
- Application takes ~7-8 seconds per station (approach bucket, apply, rub hands)
- Chalk can run out during busy race weekends (confirmed at 2025 Worlds)
- Liquid chalk is NOT mentioned as permitted — the rule says "event-provided chalk" only
- If your race strategy depends on chalk, you have a single point of failure

**Which stations benefit from chalk?**
- Sled Pull — primary grip challenge; rope can be slippery from sweat and prior use
- Farmers Carry — supporting 16-32kg per hand for 200m; grip endurance is critical
- SkiErg and Rowing also benefit from grip, but chalk is NOT permitted at these stations

### 2.4 Weightlifting Belt

**Should you wear a weightlifting belt for Hyrox?**

**Generally: NO.**

Rationale:
- A standard 4-inch weightlifting belt restricts diaphragmatic breathing, which is critical during 8km of running at elevated heart rate
- No Hyrox station involves the kind of maximal spinal loading that truly requires belt support:
  - Sled push/pull: Horizontal force, not axial spinal load
  - Farmers Carry: Heavy but submaximal grip challenge, not spinal compression
  - Sandbag Lunges: 10-30kg sandbag on shoulders — significant but not belt-territory weight
  - Wall Balls: 4-9kg ball, 100 reps — muscular endurance, not maximal load
  - SkiErg/Rowing: Upper body pulling — belt not relevant
  - Burpee Broad Jumps: Bodyweight movement
- Belt must be worn from start to finish per rulebook rules (Section 11.1 — items "must do so from the start to the finish of their race")
- The breathing restriction over 60-120 minutes would likely cost more performance than any stabilization benefit

**Rare exception:** An athlete with a specific diagnosed back condition (e.g., herniated disc, spondylolisthesis) who has been medically advised to wear a belt during loaded exercise. In this case, use the thinnest possible belt and accept the breathing tradeoff.

### 2.5 Other Race Day Gear

#### Race Belt / Bib
- A race number belt (elastic belt with clips to hold your bib) eliminates the need for safety pins through your shirt
- Prevents bib from bouncing/flapping during running
- Allows you to reposition bib easily
- Widely used and recommended — inexpensive ($10-$20) and highly practical
- Note: Bib must be visible and wristband must be worn visibly

#### Hydration
- **Water stations** are available at least once during/before/after each Roxzone pass (effectively ~8 opportunities throughout the race)
- Cups at water stations provide ~100-150ml each *(Source: VOOM Nutrition)*
- **Hydration packs are permitted** (rulebook Section 11.1) — but must be worn from start to finish
- **Soft flasks** tucked into shorts/belt are popular — more practical than a full vest
- For races <75 min: Aid station water is typically sufficient
- For races 75min-2hr: Consider a 500ml soft flask with electrolyte solution
- For races >2hr: Strongly consider carrying hydration *(Source: Precision Hydration)*
- **Important:** Pouring water over your head/body is PROHIBITED (2-minute penalty) — fluids are for drinking only

#### Nutrition
- Must be carried on your person from the start — cannot receive food/drink from spectators
- Energy gels are the most common choice — test in training first
- Carry 1-2 gels for mid-race consumption during run segments or less intense transitions
- Aim for 30-60g carbs per hour for races >75 min *(Source: Precision Hydration)*

#### Headband / Sweatband
- Convention center venues are heated, often with limited airflow — temperatures can be very high
- Sweatbands prevent sweat from dripping into eyes (especially problematic during wall balls when looking up)
- Lightweight and practical — widely used
- Not listed as restricted in the rulebook

#### Compression Gear
- **Evidence is mixed but generally positive for perception of recovery and comfort.** A 2016 study in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found enhanced recovery of muscle strength and reduced DOMS. Research in the International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance suggested compression can improve running economy. *(Source: WaveWear citing peer-reviewed studies)*
- Multiple Hyrox-focused articles promote compression for reduced muscle vibration, enhanced proprioception, and improved venous return between stations
- **Practical reality:** Many athletes wear compression shorts/tights for comfort and chafe prevention regardless of performance benefits
- **Recommendation:** If you like compression gear, wear it. There's no meaningful downside. The performance benefits are likely small but non-zero. Don't buy it expecting a breakthrough — buy it if it's comfortable.

#### Watch / Heart Rate Monitor
- Permitted (not on the forbidden items list)
- Useful for: pacing run segments, monitoring heart rate to avoid going anaerobic early, tracking total time, counting laps
- **GPS will not work indoors** — use a watch that also tracks heart rate via optical sensor
- Ensure the watch fits under any gloves you're wearing
- Popular choices in the Resilience Fitness survey: Garmin and Apple Watch were most common; some athletes use a training-specific watch (Garmin/Coros) rather than their everyday Apple Watch *(Source: Resilience Fitness Gear Guide 2025)*
- Lap counter function is valuable — losing track of running laps is a common mistake that leads to 3-7 minute penalties *(Source: multiple race mistake articles)*

#### Knee Sleeves
- Permitted (rulebook Section 11.1)
- Can provide warmth and mild compression for the knee joint during lunges, wall balls, and burpee broad jumps
- Many athletes use them; personal preference
- Must be worn from start to finish

## 3. WHAT EXPERIENCED ATHLETES ACTUALLY BRING

### 3.1 The Minimal Race Kit

Based on surveys, race guides, and athlete reports from multiple sources (Wheelhouse Academy, Resilience Fitness, RoxLyfe, No Excuses CrossFit, Centr):

#### ON YOUR BODY (race start):
1. ✅ **Shoes** — broken in, tested on sleds, comfortable for 8km+
2. ✅ **Socks** — moisture-wicking, tested in training (blister prevention is critical). Feetures and Nike were popular in surveys
3. ✅ **Shorts** — lightweight, moisture-wicking, compression-lined recommended (prevents chafing). Some athletes prefer short tights/compression shorts
4. ✅ **Top** — lightweight tank or short-sleeve technical tee. **Avoid cotton.** Convention centers are hot — less is more
5. ✅ **Race bib** — on race belt or pinned to front
6. ✅ **Timing chip** — on ankle (received at check-in, mandatory)
7. ✅ **Wristband** — from check-in (indicates division/wave, mandatory)
8. ✅ **Watch** — for pacing, heart rate, and lap counting
9. ✅ **Gloves** (optional) — if trained with them
10. ✅ **Nutrition** — 1-2 gels tucked in waistband or shorts pocket
11. ✅ **Hydration** (optional) — soft flask if race will be 75+ minutes

#### IN YOUR DROP BAG / BACKPACK:
1. ✅ Change of clothes (including underwear and socks)
2. ✅ Flip-flops or recovery slides
3. ✅ Towel
4. ✅ Body wipes / deodorant
5. ✅ Protein bar or recovery snack
6. ✅ Phone charger / power bank
7. ✅ Reusable water bottle (for pre/post race hydration)
8. ✅ Plastic bag for sweaty clothes
9. ✅ Government-issued photo ID (required for check-in)
10. ✅ Registration confirmation

#### WARM-UP TOOLS (optional but recommended):
1. ✅ Lacrosse ball (calves, glutes, traps)
2. ✅ Small foam roller
3. ✅ Mini resistance bands (for glute/shoulder activation)

### 3.2 Common Mistakes

**❌ Overdressing**
- Convention centers are heated indoor venues with limited ventilation
- Thousands of athletes generate enormous body heat
- Long sleeves, multiple layers, heavy fabrics = overheating, energy waste
- Ideal kit: shorts + lightweight technical tank/tee
- *"Think thin shorts, light top, maybe a sweatband"* *(Source: Hyrox race day checklist video)*

**❌ Wearing Brand-New Untested Shoes**
- The #1 gear mistake repeatedly cited across all sources
- *"Wear the shoes you've trained in, ones you already know feel stable during sled work and comfortable during running intervals. Breaking in new shoes on race day can lead to blisters, bruises, or worse, a distracted mindset."* *(Source: Wheelhouse Academy)*
- Break in any new shoes **at least 3-4 workouts prior** to race day
- Test shoes on a heavy sled push — if your feet slip, the shoe fails the Hyrox test

**❌ Bringing Too Much Gear**
- You cannot access your bag during the race
- Everything you need must be on your body from start to finish
- Keep it simple: shoes, clothes, watch, maybe gloves, nutrition, hydration
- Leave the foam roller, massage gun, extra shoes, etc. in your bag

**❌ Forgetting Nutrition/Hydration**
- Many athletes assume the water stations will be sufficient and forget to plan nutrition
- Must carry nutrition from the start — cannot receive it during the race
- Test gels and hydration in training — "Race day is not the time to experiment" *(Source: SugarWOD, Precision Hydration, RoxLyfe)*
- Some athletes report GI distress from untested gels mid-race

**❌ Not Having Anti-Chafe Protection**
- 8km of running + loaded lunges + rowing = significant friction on inner thighs, underarms, nipples
- Apply body glide or similar anti-chafe product before the race
- Compression shorts help prevent inner thigh chafing

**❌ Arriving Late**
- Check-in requires photo ID and registration confirmation
- You receive your timing chip, bib, and wristband at check-in
- Recommended: **Arrive 90 minutes early** *(Source: Centr)*
- You need time for: check-in → bag drop → warm-up → start zone assembly (10 min before wave start)

**❌ Relying on Chalk Being Available**
- Chalk is only provided at Sled Pull and Farmers Carry
- It can run out during busy events
- If grip is a concern, consider gloves as a backup strategy
- You CANNOT bring your own chalk

## Original Prompt

```
You are an equipment specialist building a knowledge base for an AI-powered Hyrox coach. The coach's v1 model made DANGEROUS equipment recommendations (recommending Nike Vaporfly carbon-plate racing flats for Hyrox). This research must provide CORRECT, verified equipment guidance.

## CRITICAL CONTEXT
The AI coach previously recommended Nike Vaporfly Next% as the "#1 Hyrox shoe" claiming "4%+ VO2max improvement from the carbon plate." This is DANGEROUS because:
- Vaporfly has zero lateral stability (ankle injury risk during sled work, burpee broad jumps, lunges)
- No grip on sled push surfaces
- Carbon plate could snap during non-running activities
- Shoe destroyed in one race ($250 wasted)
- The "4% VO2max" claim is wrong (research shows ~4% energy cost reduction, not VO2max)

We need CORRECT information to fix this.

## 1. Footwear for Hyrox

### The Hyrox Shoe Problem
- Why shoe selection is uniquely challenging for Hyrox (8km running + 8 functional fitness stations)
- What properties matter: cushioning (8km running), grip (sled push/pull), lateral stability (lunges, BBJ), durability (convention center floors)
- Why pure running shoes (Vaporfly, Alphafly, any carbon-plate racer) are WRONG for Hyrox
- Why pure lifting shoes (Romaleos, Adipower) are also wrong for Hyrox
- The ideal shoe profile: hybrid cross-trainer with moderate cushion

### Specific Shoe Recommendations
For each shoe, provide: name, price range, pros for Hyrox, cons for Hyrox, best suited for which type of athlete

Top shoes actually used by competitive Hyrox athletes:
- Nike Metcon 9 / Metcon 10
- Reebok Nano X4
- NOBULL Trainer / NOBULL Runner+
- TYR CXT-1 Trainer
- Puma Fuse 2.0 / Puma Fuse 3.0
- GORUCK Ballistic Trainer
- Nike Free Metcon
- Under Armour TriBase Reign
- On Cloud X / On Cloudflow (for runner-dominant athletes)
- Any other shoes commonly seen at Hyrox events

### Shoe Selection by Athlete Type
- Runner-dominant athlete (strong cardio, weaker stations): what to prioritize
- Strength-dominant athlete (strong stations, weaker running): what to prioritize
- First-timer vs experienced competitor recommendations
- Budget options vs premium picks

### What NOT to Wear
- Carbon-plate racing flats (Vaporfly, Alphafly, Endorphin Pro) — explain exactly why
- Minimalist/barefoot shoes (Vibram FiveFingers, Xero) — why
- Heavy lifting shoes (Romaleos, Adipower) — why
- Old/worn-out shoes — grip and support concerns
- Trail running shoes — unnecessary tread, heavy

## 2. Race Day Gear

### What Hyrox Rules Allow and Prohibit
- Official Hyrox equipment rules for the 2024/2025 and 2025/2026 seasons
- What items are prohibited on the course
- What items are provided at stations (do they provide wall balls, sleds, etc.?)
- Can you bring your own jump rope? Chalk? Grips?

### Gloves
- Do experienced Hyrox athletes use gloves?
- When gloves help: farmer carry grip, sled pull rope, wall ball catch
- When gloves hurt: reduced feel, can bunch up
- Best glove types if using them (full finger vs fingerless, material)
- Alternative: chalk, tape, or going bare-handed

### Chalk
- Is chalk allowed at Hyrox events?
- Liquid chalk vs dry chalk rules
- Which stations benefit from chalk (farmer carry, sled pull)
- Practical application tips

### Weightlifting Belt
- Should you wear a weightlifting belt for Hyrox? (ANSWER: Generally NO)
- Why a 4-inch weightlifting belt impedes breathing during 8km of running
- Why no Hyrox station truly requires belt support
- The rare exception: if an athlete has a specific back condition

### Other Gear
- Race belt for bib number (useful to avoid pins)
- Hydration: can you carry water? Where are water stations?
- Headband/sweatband (convention centers are hot)
- Compression gear: any evidence it helps?
- Watch/heart rate monitor considerations
- What to carry in a drop bag / transition area

## 3. What Experienced Athletes Actually Bring

### The Minimal Race Kit
- What does a typical competitive Hyrox athlete bring on race day?
- Essentials vs nice-to-haves
- What to leave at home
- Pre-race area setup

### Common Mistakes
- Overdressing (convention centers are heated)
- Bringing too much gear
- Wearing brand-new untested shoes
- Forgetting nutrition/hydration supplies

Provide specific, verified information with sources where possible. Prioritize information from Hyrox official rules, elite Hyrox coaches, and competitive athletes' actual race day experience. Do NOT speculate — if information isn't available, say so.
```
