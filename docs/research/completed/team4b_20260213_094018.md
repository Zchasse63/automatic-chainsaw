# Recovery Science & Testing Protocols for AI-Powered Hyrox Coaching

## 1. Recovery & Adaptation Science for Hybrid Athletes

---

### 1.1 Sleep

#### Optimal Sleep Duration

Athletes training 10–12 hours per week require **8.0–9.5 hours of sleep per night** for optimal recovery and adaptation. This is supported by multiple lines of evidence:

- **Stanford sleep extension studies** (Mah et al., 2011): When collegiate basketball players extended sleep to ~10 hours, sprint times improved, shooting accuracy increased by 9%, and reaction times off the blocks were faster. Similar results were replicated in swimmers and tennis players (Mah et al., 2011; Sleep Foundation, 2025).
- **IOC position statement** (Reardon et al., 2019): Recommends a minimum of 7 hours for adult athletes, but acknowledges this is a *floor*, not a target.
- **Epidemiological data**: Elite athletes average only 6.5–6.8 hours of sleep (Leeder et al., 2012; Lastella et al., 2015), which is *insufficient*. Athletes sleeping <7 hours had 1.7× higher injury risk (Milewski et al., 2014).

**AI Coach Rule**: Target 8–9 hours of actual sleep time (not time in bed). If an athlete consistently logs <7 hours, flag this as a primary recovery limiter before adjusting training load.

#### Sleep Quality Metrics That Matter

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Deep sleep (SWS) | ≥1.5 hours (15–20% of total) | Growth hormone release is synchronized with slow-wave sleep (Shapiro et al., 1981). Critical for tissue repair, glycogen repletion, and anabolic processes (GSSI, SSE-113). |
| REM sleep | ≥1.5 hours (20–25% of total) | Motor skill consolidation, learning, creativity, and emotional regulation (Walker & Stickgold, 2006; Cai et al., 2009). |
| Sleep efficiency | ≥85% | Time asleep / time in bed. Athletes average only 80.6% vs. 88.7% in non-athletes (Leeder et al., 2012). |
| HRV during sleep | Stable or trending upward | Nocturnal HRV reflects parasympathetic recovery. A sustained drop of >1 SD below baseline for 3+ nights signals incomplete recovery (Hynynen et al., 2006). |
| Wake after sleep onset | <30 minutes | Excessive WASO fragments deep sleep and REM cycles. |

#### Impact of Poor Sleep on Training Adaptations

The research is unequivocal — poor sleep degrades virtually every adaptation pathway relevant to Hyrox:

1. **Aerobic performance**: Sleep restriction (4 hours) reduced time to exhaustion and increased lactate accumulation at submaximal intensities. VO₂max decreased, and heart rate was significantly elevated at the same workload (Mougin et al., 1991, 2001). One night of sleep deprivation decreased treadmill distance covered by 3% (Oliver et al., 2009).
2. **Glycogen repletion**: 30-hour sleep deprivation reduced pre-exercise muscle glycogen by 33% (310 vs. 209 mmol/kg; Skein et al., 2011), directly impairing endurance capacity.
3. **Hormonal disruption**: Sleep deprivation impairs growth hormone secretion, increases cortisol, and disrupts testosterone production (Mougin et al., 2001; Spiegel et al., 1999). This shifts the body toward a catabolic state.
4. **Immune function**: Prolonged insufficient sleep increases pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, CRP), suppresses cell-mediated immunity, and increases upper respiratory tract infection risk (Haack et al., 2007, 2009; Charest & Grandner, 2020).
5. **Motor learning**: Sleep after learning a new skill is critical for motor consolidation (Walker et al., 2002). Poor sleep impairs technique acquisition — relevant for SkiErg efficiency, wall ball rhythm, and sled mechanics.
6. **Perceived exertion**: The most consistent finding is that sleep-deprived athletes report *everything* feeling harder, even at the same absolute intensity (Oliver et al., 2009).

#### Practical Sleep Hygiene Recommendations

1. **Consistent wake time** (±30 min, even on weekends) — anchors circadian rhythm
2. **Cool bedroom** (18–20°C / 64–68°F) — facilitates core temperature drop for sleep onset
3. **Dim lights 60–90 min before bed** — supports melatonin production
4. **No caffeine after 1:00 PM** (or ≥8 hours before bed) — caffeine taken even 6 hours before bed reduced total sleep by 41 minutes (Drake et al., 2013)
5. **No screens 30–60 min before bed** — or use blue light filters
6. **Post-training cool-down**: After evening training, allow ≥2 hours before bed. A warm shower 90 min pre-bed paradoxically helps by triggering peripheral vasodilation and subsequent core cooling.
7. **Strategic napping**: 20–30 min naps before 2:00 PM can partially offset sleep debt without disrupting nighttime sleep.
8. **Sleep banking**: 1–2 weeks of extended sleep (10+ hours) before a high-load training block or race can buffer against subsequent restriction (Arnal et al., 2015, 2016).

### 1.2 Active Recovery Protocols

#### What to Do on Rest Days

Rest days are not passive — they are *active recovery* days. The goal is to enhance blood flow, clear metabolic waste, promote tissue remodeling, and maintain nervous system readiness without adding training stress.

**Ideal Rest Day Structure (90–120 min total across the day):**
- 30–45 min low-intensity movement (walking, easy cycling, swimming)
- 15 min mobility routine (see Section 1.3)
- 10–15 min foam rolling / self-myofascial release
- Optional: 10–15 min sauna or contrast exposure
- Prioritize sleep, nutrition, and hydration

#### Low-Intensity Movement

The purpose of active recovery movement is to stay below the ventilatory threshold — conversational pace, RPE 2–3/10, heart rate <60% HRmax (Zone 1).

| Modality | Duration | Intensity | Notes |
|----------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Walking | 30–60 min | RPE 2/10 | Best general recovery; minimal eccentric load |
| Easy cycling | 20–40 min | RPE 2–3/10, <120 bpm | Non-weight-bearing; good for leg recovery |
| Swimming (easy) | 20–30 min | RPE 2–3/10 | Hydrostatic pressure aids lymphatic drainage; excellent for whole-body recovery |
| Yoga / gentle flow | 30–45 min | RPE 2/10 | Combines mobility, breathing, parasympathetic activation |

**Key principle**: If an athlete finishes active recovery feeling more fatigued than when they started, the intensity was too high.

#### Foam Rolling / Self-Myofascial Release

**What the evidence supports:**
- **Acute ROM improvement**: Foam rolling increases range of motion by 4–10% without decreasing force production or neuromuscular activation (MacDonald et al., 2013; Halperin et al., 2014; Cheatham et al., 2015 meta-analysis).
- **Recovery from DOMS**: Foam rolling post-exercise reduced perceived soreness at 24, 48, and 72 hours, and improved dynamic performance measures (sprint speed, broad jump, vertical jump) compared to controls (Pearcey et al., 2015; MacDonald et al., 2014).
- **Mechanism**: Likely a combination of neurological (pain-gate modulation, altered mechanoreceptor signaling) and vascular effects (increased nitric oxide, improved endothelial function) rather than mechanical tissue deformation (Wiewelhove et al., 2019 meta-analysis).

**What is myth:**
- Foam rolling does NOT "break up" scar tissue or fascial adhesions. The forces required to deform fascia (~450 N) far exceed what a foam roller produces.
- Foam rolling does NOT permanently increase flexibility — effects are transient (10–20 min) unless paired with consistent training through new ROM.

**Practical prescription:**
- **Dose**: 60–120 seconds per muscle group, moderate pressure (pain should be ≤6/10)
- **Frequency**: Daily on rest days, post-training on training days
- **Priority areas for Hyrox**: Quadriceps, hip flexors, calves, thoracic spine, lats, forearm extensors

#### Stretching: Static vs. Dynamic

| Type | When to Use | Evidence |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Dynamic stretching** | Pre-workout, during warm-up | Improves acute performance (power, sprint speed, agility). Recommended as part of all warm-ups (Behm & Chaouachi, 2011). |
| **Static stretching** | Post-workout, rest days, evenings | Improves chronic flexibility over weeks when held ≥30 sec (Bandy & Irion, 1994). Pre-exercise static holds >60 sec can reduce force production by 5–7% (Kay & Blazevich, 2012 meta-analysis). Shorter holds (<30 sec) likely have negligible performance effects. |
| **PNF stretching** | Dedicated mobility sessions | Most effective for ROM gains but requires a partner or band. Contract-relax: 6 sec contraction, 30 sec stretch, 3 rounds. |

**AI Coach Rule**: Never prescribe >30 sec static holds before strength or power-dominant sessions (sled work, wall balls). Dynamic stretching only in pre-workout warm-ups.

#### Cold Water Immersion / Ice Baths

The evidence on CWI is **mode-dependent and nuanced**:

**Post-resistance training — AVOID:**
- Roberts et al. (2015) demonstrated that CWI (10°C for 10 min) after resistance training attenuated acute anabolic signaling (phosphorylation of p70S6K, satellite cell activity) and, over 12 weeks, resulted in significantly less muscle hypertrophy and strength gains compared to active recovery.
- Malta et al. (2021) meta-analysis confirmed: CWI consistently diminishes resistance training adaptations including strength, power, and rate of force development (Petersen & Fyfe, 2021).

**Post-endurance training — NEUTRAL:**
- CWI does NOT appear to negatively affect aerobic adaptations (cycling time trial performance, VO₂max, mitochondrial biogenesis) in trained athletes (Halson et al., 2014; Broatch et al., 2017; Malta et al., 2021).
- The high-intensity exercise stimulus may create a ceiling effect for mitochondrial adaptation, leaving little room for CWI to either help or harm (Granata et al., 2016).

**Practical recommendation for Hyrox athletes:**
- **Avoid CWI on days with strength-focused work** (heavy sled, squat days, hypertrophy sessions).
- **Permissible after pure running sessions** if subjective recovery is needed, particularly during competition periods or multi-day events.
- **During race week/taper**: CWI can be used for perceived recovery benefit without concern for long-term adaptation.
- **Protocol if used**: 10–15°C water, 10–12 minutes immersion.

#### Sauna / Heat Exposure

**Current evidence supports sauna use as an ergogenic aid:**

- **Plasma volume expansion**: Scoon et al. (2006) found that 12–15 post-exercise sauna sessions (~87°C, 30 min) over 3 weeks increased plasma volume by 7.1% and improved 5K time trial performance by 1.9%.
- **Comprehensive adaptation study**: Kirby et al. (2021) showed 3 weeks of post-exercise sauna bathing improved VO₂max, running speed at 4 mmol/L lactate, and time to exhaustion — to a greater extent than endurance training alone.
- **Heat acclimation benefits**: Reduced heart rate during exercise, reduced core temperature, increased sweat rate, improved thermoregulation — all beneficial for Hyrox performance (especially in indoor venues which are often warm).

**Practical prescription:**
- **Frequency**: 3–4 sessions per week, post-training
- **Protocol**: 80–100°C dry sauna, 15–30 min per session (start at 15 min, build to 30)
- **Timing**: Immediately after easy/moderate training sessions (not before strength work)
- **Hydration**: Consume 500–750 mL water with electrolytes during/after sauna
- **Caution**: Extending beyond 3 weeks showed only marginal additional benefit (Kirby et al., 2021). 3-week blocks are sufficient.

**Unlike CWI, sauna does NOT appear to attenuate strength or hypertrophy adaptations**, making it the preferred thermal recovery modality for hybrid athletes.

### 1.3 Mobility Routines for Hyrox Athletes

#### Key Mobility Restrictions Affecting Hyrox Performance

| Restriction | Stations Affected | Consequence |
|------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Thoracic extension** | SkiErg, Wall Balls, Rowing | Inability to fully extend arms overhead limits SkiErg pull length and wall ball catch position. Compensatory lumbar extension increases injury risk. |
| **Hip flexor mobility** | Lunges, Running, Sled Push, Burpee Broad Jumps | Tight hip flexors reduce stride length, cause anterior pelvic tilt during lunges, and limit hip extension drive in sled push. |
| **Ankle dorsiflexion** | Wall Balls, Lunges, Sled Push | <35° of dorsiflexion forces compensatory heel rise, forward torso lean, and reduced squat depth. Limits lunge step length. |
| **Shoulder mobility** (flexion + internal rotation) | SkiErg, Wall Balls, Rowing | Restricted overhead range reduces SkiErg stroke length. Poor internal rotation limits rowing catch position. |
| **Grip and forearm** | Farmers Carry, Sled Pull, Rowing | Forearm extensor tightness and poor wrist extension limit grip endurance. Crucial for 200m farmer's carry and sled pull rope work. |

#### 15-Minute Daily Mobility Routine

Perform daily — on rest days as standalone, on training days post-workout or in the evening.

| # | Movement | Target Area | Duration/Reps | Cues |
|---|----------|-------------|---------------|------|
| 1 | **Foam roll thoracic spine** | T-spine extension | 60 sec | Roller at mid-back, arms crossed over chest, extend over roller through 5–6 segments. Pause 10 sec at each stiff segment. |
| 2 | **Open book rotations** | T-spine rotation | 8 reps/side | Side-lying, knees stacked at 90°, top arm rotates open to floor. Follow hand with eyes. Exhale into end range. |
| 3 | **Half-kneeling hip flexor stretch** | Hip flexors (psoas, rec fem) | 45 sec/side | Rear knee on pad, squeeze glute on rear leg, slight posterior pelvic tilt, shift hips forward. Add same-side arm overhead reach for psoas bias. |
| 4 | **90/90 hip switches** | Hip internal/external rotation | 10 reps (5/side) | Sit on floor, both legs at 90°, rotate hips to switch lead leg. Keep chest tall. Controlled 3 sec transitions. |
| 5 | **Wall ankle dorsiflexion mobilization** | Ankle dorsiflexion | 10 reps/side (2 sec holds) | Front foot 10–12 cm from wall, drive knee over toes to touch wall. Keep heel down. Progress by moving foot further from wall. |
| 6 | **Supine shoulder flexion (PVC/dowel)** | Shoulder overhead ROM | 10 reps | Lie on back, knees bent, hold PVC wide grip, slowly arc overhead to floor. Keep ribs pinned down (no rib flare). 3 sec tempo each direction. |
| 7 | **Thread the needle** | T-spine rotation + shoulder | 6 reps/side | Quadruped position. Reach one arm under body, rotate to thread through. Then open arm to ceiling. Follow hand with eyes. |
| 8 | **Forearm extensor stretch + wrist circles** | Grip/forearm | 30 sec stretch + 10 circles/direction | Extend arm, palm down, gently pull fingers back with opposite hand. Then perform slow wrist circles. |
| 9 | **Deep squat hold (goblet position)** | Ankles, hips, T-spine (integrated) | 60 sec total (break into 2×30 sec if needed) | Hold light weight at chest, sit into deep squat, elbows inside knees pressing out. Breathe diaphragmatically. Shift weight side to side. |
| 10 | **Couch stretch** | Rectus femoris + hip flexors | 45 sec/side | Rear foot on wall/couch, front foot in lunge. Squeeze glute, stay upright. This is the most effective hip flexor stretch for athletes who sit. |

**Total time**: ~15 minutes. Perform in order listed.

#### 5-Minute Pre-Workout Activation Routine

Perform before every training session after a 5-min general warm-up (easy jog/bike).

| # | Movement | Purpose | Sets × Reps |
|---|----------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Cat-cow** | T-spine mobilization, breathing | 1 × 8 (slow, coordinated with breath) |
| 2 | **World's greatest stretch** | Hip flexors, T-spine rotation, hamstrings, ankles | 1 × 4/side |
| 3 | **Lateral band walks** | Glute med activation (running, lunges, sled) | 1 × 10/direction |
| 4 | **Banded pull-aparts** | Posterior shoulder activation (SkiErg, row, wall ball catch) | 1 × 15 |
| 5 | **Bodyweight squats to calf raise** | Ankle ROM + glute/quad activation + calf prime | 1 × 10 |

**Total time**: ~5 minutes. Non-negotiable before every session.

### 1.4 Overtraining & Overreaching

#### Definitions (European College of Sport Science Position Statement; Meeusen et al., 2006)

| Term | Performance Decrement | Recovery Time | Outcome |
|------|----------------------|---------------|---------|
| **Functional Overreaching (FO)** | Days to ~2 weeks | Short-term | *Positive* — supercompensation after rest |
| **Non-Functional Overreaching (NFO)** | Weeks to months | Extended | *Negative* — lost training time, psychological/neuroendocrine symptoms |
| **Overtraining Syndrome (OTS)** | Months to >1 year | Prolonged | *Severely negative* — potential career-ending; maladapted HPA axis, systemic inflammation |

Key insight: These exist on a continuum, and the differentiation between NFO and OTS can only be made *retrospectively* based on recovery time (Kreher & Schwartz, 2012). Lifetime NFO prevalence in elite runners is ~60% (Morgan et al., 1987). OTS is rare but devastating.

#### Early Warning Signs for AI Coach Monitoring

| Marker | Normal Variation | Concerning Threshold | Action Trigger |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Performance decline** | ±2–3% day-to-day | >5% decline sustained over 2+ weeks despite adequate recovery | Flag for review |
| **Resting heart rate** | ±3 bpm day-to-day | ≥5 bpm above rolling 7-day average for 3+ consecutive days (Kreher & Schwartz, 2012; TrainingPeaks) | Reduce intensity; monitor for illness |
| **HRV depression** | ±5–10% day-to-day | >1 standard deviation below 7-day rolling mean for 3–4 consecutive days (Human Performance Alliance, 2024) | Insert recovery day; reduce volume 30% |
| **Sleep disruption** | Occasional poor night | <6 hrs for 3+ consecutive nights, OR sleep efficiency <75% for 1+ week | Mandatory light day; investigate cause |
| **Mood/motivation changes** | Normal fluctuation | Profile of Mood States (POMS) vigor score decline >15% or persistent negative mood for 5+ days | Conversation prompt; reduce training load |
| **Persistent soreness** | 24–48 hr DOMS normal | Muscle soreness ≥4/10 persisting >72 hours after a familiar workout | Skip strength session; active recovery only |
| **Training session completion** | Can start AND finish | Ability to start but inability to complete planned sessions (classic OTS sign; Budgett, 1998) | Immediate red flag; insert 3+ rest days |

#### Decision Framework: Push Through vs. Back Off

**PUSH THROUGH fatigue when:**
- HRV is within normal range (within 1 SD of rolling mean)
- Resting HR is within 3 bpm of baseline
- Athlete reports 6/10 or better motivation/mood
- Soreness is ≤3/10 and localized (not systemic)
- Sleep was ≥7 hours with normal quality
- Performance in warm-up sets is within 5% of expected

**BACK OFF when any 2+ of these are true:**
- HRV depressed >1 SD below baseline for 2+ days
- Resting HR elevated ≥5 bpm for 2+ days
- Mood/motivation ≤4/10
- Soreness is systemic (whole body) and >72 hours post-training
- Sleep was <6 hours or severely disrupted
- Performance in warm-up sets is >5% below expected

**MANDATORY REST when any 1 of these is true:**
- Signs of illness (sore throat, fever, swollen glands)
- Resting HR elevated ≥8 bpm above baseline
- Unable to complete warm-up at expected intensity
- 3+ warning signs present simultaneously for 3+ consecutive days

#### Reactive Deload Protocol

Unlike planned deloads (every 3–4 weeks), reactive deloads are triggered by the warning signs above. The AI coach should implement the following:

**Phase 1 — Acute Response (Days 1–3):**
- Reduce training volume by 50%
- Eliminate all high-intensity work (no intervals, no heavy lifting)
- Replace planned sessions with Zone 1 movement only (30–40 min walk, easy bike)
- Prioritize 9+ hours of sleep opportunity
- Increase carbohydrate intake by 1 g/kg/day

**Phase 2 — Assessment (Days 4–5):**
- Retest: Check morning HRV, RHR, sleep quality, subjective mood
- If markers improving → transition to Phase 3
- If markers unchanged or worsening → extend Phase 1 for 3 more days and screen for illness/life stressors

**Phase 3 — Gradual Return (Days 6–10):**
- Day 6–7: 70% of normal volume, low-to-moderate intensity only
- Day 8–10: 85% of normal volume, reintroduce moderate intensity
- Day 11+: Return to full programming if all markers are normalized

**Critical rule**: The athlete must demonstrate 2 consecutive days of normalized HRV and RHR before returning to high-intensity training.

### 1.5 Nutrition for Training

#### Daily Caloric Needs

A hybrid athlete running ~35–40 miles per week (56–64 km) plus 4–5 strength sessions requires substantial caloric intake. Using established estimates:

- **Running**: ~80–100 kcal/mile × 35–40 mpw = 2,800–4,000 kcal/week from running
- **Strength**: ~250–400 kcal/session × 4–5 = 1,000–2,000 kcal/week from lifting
- **BMR + NEAT**: ~1,800–2,200 kcal/day for a 70–85 kg male athlete

**Estimated total**: **2,800–3,800 kcal/day** for a male Hyrox athlete (70–85 kg). Female athletes (55–70 kg): **2,200–3,000 kcal/day**. These ranges depend on body size, training phase, and metabolic rate. Chronic underfueling leads to Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S) (Mountjoy et al., 2018 IOC Consensus).

#### Macronutrient Targets

| Macronutrient | Target | Evidence Base |
|---------------|--------|---------------|
| **Protein** | **1.6–2.2 g/kg/day** | ISSN position stand (Jäger et al., 2017): 1.4–2.0 g/kg/day for exercising individuals. Concurrent training athletes (combined endurance + resistance) should target the *upper end* of this range (1.6–2.2 g/kg) due to increased amino acid oxidation from endurance work (PMC, 2025: 0.4–0.5 g/kg per meal for endurance-adapted athletes). Distribute across **4–5 meals** at 0.3–0.5 g/kg per meal (20–40 g per serving). |
| **Carbohydrates** | **5–8 g/kg/day** (training days); **3–5 g/kg/day** (rest days) | ACSM/AND/DC joint position (2016): 5–7 g/kg for 1 hr/day moderate exercise, 6–10 g/kg for 1–3 hr/day moderate-to-high. A Hyrox athlete training 1.5–2.5 hr/day should target 5–8 g/kg on training days. Lower on rest days to support recovery without excess. |
| **Fat** | **Minimum 0.8 g/kg/day**; optimal **1.0–1.5 g/kg/day** (20–35% of total calories) | Fat is essential for hormone synthesis (testosterone, estrogen), fat-soluble vitamin absorption (D, E, K, A), and cell membrane integrity. Below 0.8 g/kg, hormonal dysfunction risk increases. No performance benefit from going above 35% of calories. |

#### Pre-Workout Nutrition

| Scenario | Timing | Composition |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **AM session (fasted risk)** | 60–90 min before: full meal OR 30–45 min before: light snack | Full meal: 1–2 g/kg carbs + 0.3 g/kg protein + low fat. Snack: banana + small protein shake, rice cake + honey + nut butter. |
| **PM session (fed state)** | 2–3 hours before: regular meal OR 60 min before: snack | If last meal was 3+ hours ago, have a snack with 30–50g carbs and 15–20g protein. If meal was within 2 hours, no additional food needed. |
| **Two-a-day sessions** | Between sessions: prioritize carb repletion | 1.0–1.2 g/kg carbs within 30 min of first session ending (Beelen et al., 2010). Add 20–25g protein. |

#### Post-Workout Nutrition: Evidence vs. Myth

**The "30-minute anabolic window" is largely a myth** — at least for athletes training in a fed state (Aragon & Schoenfeld, 2013; Schoenfeld et al., 2013):

- **Fed state training**: If the athlete consumed a meal within 3–4 hours before exercise, amino acids and insulin are still elevated. The "window" effectively extends to 5–6 hours surrounding training. Total daily protein intake matters far more than precise post-workout timing (Schoenfeld et al., 2013).
- **Fasted state training**: If training occurs after an overnight fast (early AM), post-workout protein becomes more time-sensitive. Consume 20–40g protein within 1–2 hours.
- **For glycogen repletion**: If the athlete has another session within 8 hours, carbohydrate timing IS important — consume 1.0–1.2 g/kg carbs as soon as practical post-exercise (Beelen et al., 2010). If the next session is 24+ hours away, timing is less critical; total daily intake matters more.

**Practical recommendation**: Consume a mixed meal of protein (30–40g) and carbohydrates (0.8–1.2 g/kg) within 2 hours of training. Don't stress if it's 30 minutes vs. 90 minutes — the difference is negligible for most fed-state athletes.

#### Hydration

- **Daily fluid target**: Minimum 35–45 mL/kg bodyweight (~2.5–3.5 L for a 75 kg athlete) PLUS replacement of exercise-induced losses.
- **Sweat rate estimation**: Weigh before and after 1 hour of training (minimally clothed, toweled dry). Each kg lost ≈ 1L of sweat. Typical range: 0.5–2.5 L/hour.
- **Electrolyte needs**: Sodium is the primary electrolyte lost in sweat (300–1,200 mg/L). Athletes training >90 min or heavy sweaters should add 500–1,000 mg sodium per hour of training (sports drink, electrolyte tabs, or salted food).
- **Urine color**: Pale straw = adequate. Dark gold = dehydrated. Clear = likely overhydrated (flushing electrolytes).

#### Supplements With Actual Evidence

| Supplement | Evidence Level | Dose | Mechanism | Hyrox Relevance |
|-----------|---------------|------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Creatine monohydrate** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (A-level) | 3–5 g/day (no loading needed) | Replenishes phosphocreatine for short-burst power; may improve glycogen repletion; supports lean mass. ISSN position stand confirms safety and efficacy (Buford et al., 2007). | High: Sled push, sled pull, farmers carry, wall balls — all benefit from repeated high-force contractions. |
| **Caffeine** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (A-level) | 3–6 mg/kg, 30–60 min pre-exercise | Adenosine receptor antagonist; reduces perceived exertion, improves endurance and strength-endurance. | High: Race day and key training sessions. Monitor sleep impact — stop use by early afternoon. |
| **Beta-alanine** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (A-level) | 3.2–6.4 g/day (split doses to avoid paresthesia) | Increases intramuscular carnosine, buffering H⁺ ions during high-intensity work (60–240 sec efforts). Hoffman et al. (2006): Co-supplementation with creatine improved repeated sprint performance. | Moderate-High: Wall balls (5–7 min sustained), SkiErg (3–4 min), Rowing (4–5 min) — all in the sweet spot of beta-alanine's buffering capacity. |
| **Vitamin D** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (if deficient) | 1,000–4,000 IU/day (test serum 25(OH)D; target >40 ng/mL) | Supports bone health, immune function, muscle function, mood. Deficiency is common (40–75% of athletes; Larson-Meyer & Willis, 2010). | Moderate: Foundational health. Deficiency impairs recovery and increases injury risk. |
| **Omega-3 (EPA/DHA)** | ⭐⭐⭐ (B-level) | 2–3 g combined EPA+DHA daily | Anti-inflammatory; may reduce DOMS severity and improve muscle recovery (Jouris et al., 2011). Supports cardiovascular health. | Moderate: Recovery support for high training volumes. |
| **Electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium)** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (practical) | As needed based on sweat losses | Maintain fluid balance, nerve/muscle function | High: Essential for training >60 min, especially in warm indoor Hyrox venues. |

## 2. Testing & Benchmarking Protocols

---

### 2.1 Baseline Testing Battery (Week 0)

Administer over 3–4 days to allow adequate recovery between tests. Testing order matters — do not combine maximal aerobic and maximal strength tests on the same day.

#### Day 1: Body Composition + Aerobic Capacity

**Body Composition (5 min)**
- Body weight (fasted, morning, after voiding)
- Waist circumference (at navel, relaxed exhale)
- Estimated body fat: Use Navy method (neck + waist circumference for men; neck + waist + hip for women) or skinfold calipers (3-site). Track trends, not absolute values.

**Cooper 12-Minute Run Test (30 min including warm-up)**
- **Warm-up**: 10 min easy jog + dynamic stretches + 2 × 30-sec strides
- **Protocol**: Run as far as possible in exactly 12 minutes on a flat track (400m preferred) or flat treadmill
- **Scoring**: Record total distance in meters
- **VO₂max estimation**: VO₂max = (22.351 × distance in km) − 11.288 (Cooper, 1968; correlation r = 0.90 with lab VO₂max testing)
- **Cool-down**: 5 min easy walk

| Distance (m) | Estimated VO₂max (mL/kg/min) | Hyrox Relevance |
|--------------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| 2,000 | 33.4 | Beginner — significant aerobic work needed |
| 2,400 | 42.4 | Intermediate — solid aerobic base |
| 2,800 | 51.3 | Advanced — strong aerobic capacity |
| 3,000+ | 55.8+ | Elite — competitive aerobic fitness |

#### Day 2: Lactate Threshold Proxy + Running Economy

**30-Minute Time Trial (45 min total)**
- **Warm-up**: 10 min easy jog + 4 × 30-sec progressive strides
- **Protocol**: Run at the fastest pace sustainable for exactly 30 minutes (flat course or treadmill at 1% incline). This approximates functional threshold pace (Inglis et al., 2020).
- **Record**: Total distance AND average pace. Average heart rate during final 20 minutes = estimated lactate threshold heart rate (LTHR).
- **Cool-down**: 5 min easy jog

**Running Economy Assessment (integrated)**
- During warm-up, note pace at conversational effort (can speak in full sentences = Zone 2 / aerobic base pace).
- Record this pace — it serves as the reference for all easy running prescriptions.

#### Day 3: Strength Baselines

**Estimated 1RM Testing (60 min total)**

Use a 3RM or 5RM test and calculate estimated 1RM. Safer and more practical than true 1RM testing for non-competitive lifters.

| Lift | Protocol | 1RM Estimation |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **Back Squat** | Warm-up: empty bar × 10, 50% × 5, 70% × 3, 85% × 1. Then: find heaviest set of 3 (3RM). | 1RM ≈ 3RM × 1.08 (Brzycki formula) |
| **Deadlift** | Same warm-up progression. Find 3RM. | 1RM ≈ 3RM × 1.08 |
| **Strict Press** | Warm-up: empty bar × 10, 50% × 5, 70% × 3. Find 5RM. | 1RM ≈ 5RM × 1.15 |

- Rest 3–5 min between max-effort attempts
- Record load AND bodyweight for strength-to-bodyweight ratio calculation

#### Day 4: Station-Specific Time Trials

Perform each station individually with full recovery. **Rest 5–8 minutes between stations** to capture true station capacity, not fatigue carryover.

| Station | Protocol | Record |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **SkiErg 1,000m** | All-out effort for 1,000m | Time (mm:ss) + avg pace/500m |
| **Sled Push 50m** | Race weight (152 kg men / 102 kg women); complete 50m as fast as possible | Time (mm:ss) |
| **Sled Pull 50m** | Race weight (103 kg men / 78 kg women); seated rope pull | Time (mm:ss) |
| **Burpee Broad Jumps 80m** | Full 80m as fast as possible | Time (mm:ss) |
| **Row 1,000m** | All-out effort for 1,000m | Time (mm:ss) + avg pace/500m |
| **Farmers Carry 200m** | Race weight (2 × 24 kg men / 2 × 16 kg women); complete 200m | Time (mm:ss) + number of drops |
| **Sandbag Lunges 100m** | Race weight (20 kg men / 10 kg women); complete 100m | Time (mm:ss) |
| **Wall Balls 100 reps** | Race weight (6 kg men / 4 kg women to 3m/2.7m target); 100 unbroken or with breaks | Time (mm:ss) + break pattern |

**Note**: Station testing in isolation is faster than race performance because there is no accumulated fatigue. Race-day station times are typically 15–30% slower than fresh testing.

---

### 2.2 Monthly Check-In Tests

Not every test needs to be repeated monthly. Frequency depends on sensitivity to change and athlete fatigue cost.

| Test | Frequency | Rationale |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| **Cooper test** (or 2K time trial) | Every 4–6 weeks | VO₂max changes slowly; monthly testing captures meaningful trends |
| **30-min time trial** | Every 6–8 weeks | Threshold fitness changes slowly; over-testing adds unnecessary fatigue |
| **Body composition** (weight, waist) | Every 2–4 weeks | Weight weekly (rolling 7-day average); waist monthly |
| **Strength 3RM tests** | Every 6–8 weeks | Strength gains in trained athletes are slow; frequent maximal testing adds injury risk |
| **Station time trials (2 stations)** | Every 4 weeks — rotate which 2 stations | Test the 2 weakest stations each month; cycle through all 8 over 4 months |
| **Resting HR / HRV** | Daily (passive monitoring) | Trend data; not a formal "test" but the most valuable ongoing metric |
| **Running economy (Zone 2 pace at same HR)** | Every 4 weeks | Track cardiac drift: same HR should produce faster pace as fitness improves |

#### Interpreting Month-over-Month Changes

| Metric | Meaningful Improvement | Noise / Normal Variation |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Cooper test distance | ≥100m improvement | ±50m (weather, motivation, fatigue) |
| 30-min TT distance | ≥200m or ≥5 sec/km pace improvement | ±100m |
| Back squat 3RM | ≥5% increase | ±2.5% (daily readiness variation) |
| SkiErg 1,000m | ≥5 sec improvement | ±3 sec |
| Wall Balls 100 reps | ≥15 sec improvement | ±8 sec |
| Sled push 50m | ≥10 sec improvement | ±5 sec (sled surface friction varies) |
| Zone 2 pace at same HR | ≥5 sec/km faster | ±3 sec/km (temperature, hydration) |

**Principle**: Require ≥2 consecutive tests showing improvement in the same direction before concluding a real training effect. Single data points are unreliable.

### 2.3 Performance Predictors & Targets

#### VO₂max Targets by Hyrox Performance Tier

| Hyrox Finish (Men) | Estimated VO₂max Required | Cooper Test Distance | 5K Proxy |
|--------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|----------|
| Sub-60 min (Pro elite) | ≥60 mL/kg/min | ≥3,200m | <17:00 |
| 60–75 min (Elite/Advanced) | 50–60 mL/kg/min | 2,750–3,200m | 17:00–20:00 |
| 75–90 min (Intermediate) | 42–50 mL/kg/min | 2,400–2,750m | 20:00–24:00 |
| 90+ min (Beginner) | <42 mL/kg/min | <2,400m | >24:00 |

*Women: Adjust VO₂max thresholds down ~5 mL/kg/min, running paces ~10–15% slower.*

#### Strength-to-Bodyweight Ratios Correlated with Hyrox Performance

| Lift | Beginner (<90 min) | Intermediate (75–90) | Advanced (60–75) | Elite (<60) |
|------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Back Squat 1RM/BW | 0.8–1.0× | 1.0–1.3× | 1.3–1.6× | 1.6–2.0× |
| Deadlift 1RM/BW | 1.0–1.3× | 1.3–1.6× | 1.6–2.0× | 2.0–2.5× |
| Strict Press 1RM/BW | 0.4–0.5× | 0.5–0.65× | 0.65–0.8× | 0.8–1.0× |

**Rationale**: Sled push (152 kg) requires substantial lower body strength. An 80 kg male pushing 152 kg is pushing ~1.9× BW. A higher squat-to-BW ratio directly predicts sled push speed. Similarly, deadlift strength correlates with sled pull performance, and press strength supports wall ball and SkiErg overhead drive.

#### Running Pace Benchmarks Predicting Hyrox Performance

| 5K Time | 10K Time | Predicted Hyrox Running Split (8 km) | Hyrox Tier |
|---------|----------|--------------------------------------|------------|
| <17:00 | <35:00 | 32–36 min | Elite |
| 17:00–20:00 | 35:00–42:00 | 36–44 min | Advanced |
| 20:00–24:00 | 42:00–50:00 | 44–54 min | Intermediate |
| >24:00 | >50:00 | >54 min | Beginner |

**Note**: Hyrox running splits include RoxZone transitions and the metabolic cost of station-to-run transitions. Expect Hyrox km pace to be 20–40 sec/km slower than standalone 10K pace.

#### Station-Specific Benchmarks Indicating Race Readiness

Based on data from Hyrox Data Lab (700,000+ race results) and ChAIron training guides:

| Station | Beginner Target | Intermediate Target | Advanced Target | Elite Target |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| SkiErg 1000m | 5:00–6:00 | 4:00–5:00 | 3:00–3:30 | <3:00 |
| Sled Push 50m | 4:00–5:00 | 3:00–3:30 | 2:30–3:00 | <2:30 |
| Sled Pull 50m | 3:30–4:30 | 2:30–3:15 | 2:00–2:30 | <2:00 |
| Burpee Broad Jump 80m | 7:00–8:30 | 6:00–7:00 | 5:00–6:00 | <5:00 |
| Row 1000m | 5:00–5:30 | 4:00–4:45 | 3:30–4:00 | <3:30 |
| Farmers Carry 200m | 2:30–3:30 | 2:00–2:30 | 1:45–2:00 | <1:45 |
| Lunges 100m | 5:30–7:00 | 4:30–5:30 | 3:45–4:30 | <3:45 |
| Wall Balls 100 reps | 6:00–7:00 | 4:00–5:00 | 3:30–4:00 | <3:30 |

*Times are isolated (fresh) station times. Add 15–30% for race-day estimates under fatigue.*

### 2.4 Decision Points: AI Coach Decision Rules

These if/then rules enable automated coaching adjustments based on test results and ongoing monitoring data.

---

**Rule 1: Aerobic Gains, Station Stagnation**
> **IF** Cooper test improves by ≥150m over 8 weeks **BUT** station times (sled push, wall balls, farmers carry) stagnate or worsen →
> **THEN** Shift 2 weekly training sessions from pure running to concurrent training: station-specific strength-endurance circuits (e.g., sled push + wall balls + farmers carry at race weight, 3–4 rounds, with 1km run between rounds). Aerobic base is sufficient; the limiter is now muscular endurance under fatigue.

---

**Rule 2: Strength Up, Run Pace Down**
> **IF** squat and deadlift 3RM improve by ≥8% over 8 weeks **BUT** 30-min time trial pace slows by ≥5 sec/km →
> **THEN** Likely concurrent training interference. Reduce strength training frequency from 4–5 to 3 sessions/week. Separate running and strength sessions by ≥6 hours. Ensure carbohydrate intake on training days is ≥6 g/kg. Move heavy strength to AM; run sessions to PM (or vice versa). Prioritize running volume in the current mesocycle.

---

**Rule 3: Performance Plateau (3+ Weeks)**
> **IF** athlete shows <1% improvement in any primary metric (Cooper test, 30-min TT, or 2+ station times) for 3+ consecutive weeks despite consistent training →
> **THEN** Implement a structured stimulus change block (2 weeks): (a) Swap training modalities (replace steady runs with fartlek; replace standard strength with unilateral/tempo work). (b) Introduce a novel stressor (hill sprints, altitude mask, sled sprint intervals). (c) If HRV/RHR show no suppression → the athlete is *undertrained*, not overtrained — increase training intensity by 10% for the next mesocycle.

---

**Rule 4: HRV Crash Protocol**
> **IF** HRV drops >1.5 SD below the 14-day rolling mean for 3+ consecutive days AND resting HR is elevated ≥5 bpm →
> **THEN** Activate Reactive Deload Protocol (Section 1.4). Cancel all high-intensity sessions. Replace with Zone 1 only. Add 1 extra rest day. Increase sleep target to 9+ hours. Retest HRV daily. Do not return to normal programming until HRV returns to within 0.5 SD of baseline for 2 consecutive days.

---

**Rule 5: Running Improves, SkiErg/Row Stagnate**
> **IF** 30-min TT improves by ≥200m **BUT** SkiErg and/or Row 1000m times do not improve →
> **THEN** The limiter is upper body pulling endurance, not aerobic capacity. Add 2× weekly SkiErg/Row interval sessions: 6 × 250m at goal race pace with 90 sec rest; OR 4 × 500m at threshold pace with 2 min rest. Add supplementary lat, tricep, and posterior chain work (lat pulldowns, tricep dips, prone rows).

---

**Rule 6: Single-Station Bottleneck**
> **IF** one station time is >25% slower than the athlete's percentile rank in all other stations →
> **THEN** Designate that station as the "limiter station." Allocate 3 specific sessions/week to that station for 4 weeks. Approach: 1 technique session (low weight, perfect form, video analysis), 1 capacity session (race weight, pacing practice), 1 endurance session (above race weight or extended reps/distance). Retest after 4 weeks.

---

**Rule 7: Weight Loss + Performance Decline**
> **IF** bodyweight drops >2% in 2 weeks AND performance metrics decline (any test) AND athlete is not intentionally cutting →
> **THEN** Flag RED-S risk (Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport). Immediately increase caloric intake by 300–500 kcal/day with emphasis on carbohydrates. Reduce training volume by 20%. Screen for disordered eating patterns (refer to sport dietitian if available). Do not increase training volume until weight stabilizes.

---

**Rule 8: Grip Failure Pattern**
> **IF** Farmers Carry time includes >2 drops AND/OR Sled Pull time is >30% slower than Sled Push (relative to benchmarks) →
> **THEN** Grip strength is the limiter. Prescribe: (a) Farmers carry holds 3×/week: 3 × 45 sec at race weight, building to 3 × 75 sec. (b) Towel hangs or fat grip work 2×/week. (c) Forearm roller or rice bucket work daily. (d) Rope climbing or rope pull variations 1–2×/week.

---

**Rule 9: Sled Push Catastrophe Signal**
> **IF** Sled Push time is >2× the athlete's row time (e.g., Row 4:30 but Sled Push 9:00+) →
> **THEN** Lower body strength is critically insufficient. Reprioritize programming: increase squat and leg press volume by 30%, add heavy prowler/sled sessions 2×/week at sub-race weight building to race weight. Temporarily reduce running volume by 15% to accommodate. Retest sled push every 3 weeks until it falls below 1.5× row time.

---

**Rule 10: Positive Adaptation Confirmation**
> **IF** Cooper test improves ≥100m AND 30-min TT improves ≥200m AND ≥4 of 8 station times improve ≥5% AND bodyweight is stable (±1 kg) AND HRV is trending upward over 4-week block →
> **THEN** Training plan is working. Maintain current programming structure for 1 more mesocycle (3–4 weeks) before introducing the next progressive overload phase. Document the winning recipe (session split, volume, intensity distribution) as this athlete's "known good" template for future reference.

---

**Rule 11: Race Simulation Readiness Check**
> **IF** athlete is ≤4 weeks from race day AND has not completed a full race simulation (8 stations + 8km running in sequence) →
> **THEN** Schedule a full or partial simulation (minimum: 4 stations + 4km) within the next 10 days. Use race weights. Record all split times. This is the single most valuable session in the final training block — it calibrates pacing, identifies nutrition needs, and builds psychological confidence. Taper begins after this session.

---

**Rule 12: Sleep Crisis Override**
> **IF** athlete reports <6 hours sleep for 3+ consecutive nights (regardless of all other metrics) →
> **THEN** Override all training prescriptions. Replace any planned high-intensity or heavy strength session with Zone 1 active recovery or complete rest. Sleep debt accumulates non-linearly — 3 nights of 5.5 hours creates more deficit than one night of 3 hours. Address the root cause (stress, schedule, sleep hygiene) before restoring training load. Growth hormone secretion, glycogen repletion, and motor consolidation are all compromised (Charest & Grandner, 2020; Mougin et al., 2001).

## Original Prompt

```
You are a sports science researcher building a knowledge base for an AI-powered Hyrox coach. A previous research task covered energy systems, aerobic frameworks (Hinshaw, Galpin, Seiler), and concurrent training interference but was INCOMPLETE. Your task is to cover recovery science and testing protocols.

## 1. Recovery & Adaptation Science for Hybrid Athletes

### Sleep
- Optimal sleep duration for athletes training 10-12 hours/week
- Sleep quality metrics that matter (deep sleep, REM, HRV during sleep)
- Impact of poor sleep on training adaptations (what's the research say?)
- Practical sleep hygiene recommendations for athletes

### Active Recovery Protocols
- What to do on rest days (not just "rest")
- Low-intensity movement: walking, swimming, cycling — what intensity, how long?
- Foam rolling / self-myofascial release: what works, what's myth?
- Stretching: static vs dynamic, when to use each, evidence-based recommendations
- Cold water immersion / ice baths: current evidence (help or harm adaptation?)
- Sauna / heat exposure: current evidence for recovery and adaptation

### Mobility Routines for Hyrox Athletes
- Key mobility restrictions that affect Hyrox performance:
  - Thoracic extension (affects SkiErg, wall balls, overhead position)
  - Hip flexor mobility (affects lunges, running, sled push)
  - Ankle dorsiflexion (affects squat depth for wall balls, lunge mechanics)
  - Shoulder mobility (affects SkiErg pull, wall ball catch)
  - Grip and forearm (affects farmers carry, sled pull, rowing)
- Prescribe a 15-minute daily mobility routine targeting these areas
- Prescribe a 5-minute pre-workout activation routine

### Overtraining & Overreaching
- Functional overreaching vs non-functional overreaching vs overtraining syndrome
- Early warning signs an AI coach should monitor:
  - Performance decline (what % drop is concerning?)
  - Resting heart rate elevation (what threshold?)
  - HRV depression (what change is significant?)
  - Sleep disruption
  - Mood/motivation changes
  - Persistent muscle soreness (>72 hours)
- Decision framework: when to push through fatigue vs when to back off
- How to structure a reactive deload (not just planned deloads)

### Nutrition for Training (NOT Race Day)
- Daily caloric needs for a hybrid athlete (~35-40 mpw running + 4-5 strength sessions)
- Macronutrient targets:
  - Protein: g/kg for concurrent training athletes
  - Carbohydrates: g/kg based on training volume (training days vs rest days)
  - Fat: minimum thresholds and optimal ranges
- Pre-workout nutrition: timing and composition for AM vs PM sessions
- Post-workout nutrition: the recovery window — what's evidence-based vs myth?
- Hydration: daily fluid targets, electrolyte needs, sweat rate estimation
- Supplements with actual evidence: creatine, caffeine, beta-alanine, vitamin D, omega-3

## 2. Testing & Benchmarking Protocols

### Baseline Testing Battery
Design a complete baseline testing protocol that an AI coach would administer at Week 0:
- Aerobic capacity: Cooper test or 2km time trial (VO2max estimation)
- Lactate threshold proxy: 30-minute time trial pace
- Running economy: steady-state pace at conversational effort
- Strength baselines: back squat, deadlift, strict press (1RM or estimated)
- Station-specific benchmarks: time trials for each of the 8 Hyrox stations
- Body composition: simple metrics (weight, waist, estimated body fat)

### Monthly Check-In Tests
- Which tests to repeat monthly (and which are less frequent)
- How to interpret month-over-month changes
- What constitutes meaningful improvement vs noise

### Performance Predictors & Targets
- VO2max targets by Hyrox performance tier (sub-60, 60-75, 75-90, 90+)
- Strength-to-bodyweight ratios that correlate with Hyrox performance
- Running pace benchmarks (5K, 10K times) that predict Hyrox performance
- Station-specific benchmarks that indicate race readiness

### Decision Points
For an AI coach, create decision rules:
- "If Cooper test improves by X but station times stagnate → shift training emphasis to..."
- "If strength increases but run pace slows → likely interference, adjust by..."
- "If athlete plateaus for 3+ weeks → implement..."
- Include at least 10 specific if/then decision rules

IMPORTANT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Length: At minimum 4,000 words. This fills critical gaps in the knowledge base.
- Format: Use structured markdown with H2/H3 headers, tables, and numbered lists.
- The mobility routines must be fully prescribed: movement, duration, sets.
- The testing battery must include actual protocols (distances, rest periods, scoring).
- Decision rules must be specific and actionable — not vague guidelines.
- Cite sources: research papers, sports science textbooks, coaching certifications.
