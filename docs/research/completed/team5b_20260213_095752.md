# HYROX AI Coach: Autoregulation & Adaptive Programming Framework

> **Version:** 2.0 · **Effective:** February 2026
> **Purpose:** This document defines every decision rule, threshold, and communication template the AI coach uses to modify the 16-week Hyrox periodization plan in real time. It is the system's adaptive intelligence layer—no rule may output vague language such as "adjust accordingly."

---

## 1. RPE-Based Session Modification Rules

### 1.1 Pre-Session Readiness Check

Before every session, the AI coach asks the athlete five standardized questions, each scored 1–10. The composite **Readiness Score** is the equally weighted average of all five sub-scores, rounded to one decimal place. Research supports multi-dimensional subjective wellness questionnaires as superior predictors of training tolerance compared with objective measures alone (Saw, Main & Gastin, 2016, *BJSM*; Thorpe et al., 2017, *IJSPP*).

| # | Readiness Question | Anchors (1 = worst, 10 = best) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Sleep Quality** — "Rate your sleep last night." | 1 = ≤4 hrs or constantly waking; 5 = ~6 hrs, average quality; 10 = 8+ hrs, deep, uninterrupted |
| 2 | **Muscle Soreness** — "How sore are you right now?" | 1 = severe pain / cannot move freely; 5 = moderate tightness; 10 = no soreness at all |
| 3 | **Motivation** — "How eager are you to train today?" | 1 = dreading it; 5 = neutral; 10 = fired up |
| 4 | **Life Stress** — "Rate your mental/emotional stress." | 1 = extreme stress/crisis; 5 = manageable; 10 = totally calm |
| 5 | **Nutrition / Hydration** — "How well did you eat and hydrate in the past 24 hours?" | 1 = missed meals, dehydrated; 5 = okay; 10 = dialed in |

**Readiness Score = (Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4 + Q5) / 5**

### 1.2 Readiness Tier Decision Table

| Readiness Score | Tier Label | Session Modification |
|---|---|---|
| **8.0–10.0** | 🟢 **Green — Execute** | Run session exactly as programmed. If athlete has been in Green for 5+ consecutive sessions and RPE stays ≤6, flag for potential under-programming (see Rule CR-2). |
| **6.0–7.9** | 🟡 **Yellow — Modify** | Reduce **total volume by 20%** (cut lowest-priority sets/intervals first). Maintain programmed intensity. If the session is HIIT, remove the final 1–2 rounds. If the session is strength, drop the last accessory exercise and reduce main-lift sets by 1. If the session is running, shorten distance by 20% but keep target pace. |
| **4.0–5.9** | 🟠 **Orange — Significant Modification** | Reduce **volume by 40%** AND reduce **intensity by 10–15%** (drop pace targets by 10–15 sec/km; drop strength loads by 10–15%). Convert any HIIT session to a moderate-intensity continuous session (Zone 2 run + bodyweight movement flow for 25–35 min). Cap session duration at 40 minutes. |
| **1.0–3.9** | 🔴 **Red — Recovery Session** | Replace planned session with one of the following: (a) 20-min walk + 15-min mobility/foam rolling, (b) 20-min easy swim or bike at HR <120 bpm + 10-min breathwork/meditation, (c) Full rest day with guided stretching video (15 min). Log as "recovery replacement." Re-assess readiness next day. If athlete scores Red 2+ consecutive days, trigger Overtraining Investigation Protocol (see Rule CR-13). |

### 1.3 During-Session RPE Monitoring

The AI coach requests RPE checks at three points within each session. RPE is collected on the standard Borg CR-10 scale, validated for both resistance training (Zourdos et al., 2016, *JSCR*) and endurance exercise (Foster et al., 2001, *JSCR*).

#### 1.3.1 Post-Warm-Up Check (after first 8–10 minutes)

| Warm-Up RPE | Expected RPE | Action |
|---|---|---|
| ≤5 | 3–5 | ✅ Proceed as planned. |
| 6 | 3–5 | ⚠️ Note elevated effort. Extend warm-up by 5 min of easy movement. Re-check. If RPE drops to ≤5 → proceed. If RPE stays ≥6 → downgrade session by one tier (e.g., Green → Yellow modifications). |
| 7+ | 3–5 | 🛑 Downgrade session by **two tiers** (e.g., Green → Orange). If warm-up RPE ≥ 8 → convert entire session to recovery (Red tier). Log event and flag for pattern tracking. |

#### 1.3.2 Mid-Session Check (at session midpoint)

| Mid-Session RPE vs. Target | Action |
|---|---|
| Within ±1 of target | ✅ Continue as planned. |
| 1.5–2 points above target | Reduce remaining volume by 25%. Extend rest periods by 30 seconds between sets/intervals. |
| >2 points above target | **End high-intensity work immediately.** Complete 5-min cool-down at RPE ≤3. Log as "session cut short — elevated RPE." Attribute remaining volume as missed and apply Missed Session Logic (Section 2) at the 1-session level. |
| 2+ points below target | Add 1–2 additional rounds/sets (up to 15% extra volume) OR increase pace/load by 5% for remaining work. |

#### 1.3.3 Post-Session RPE (sRPE — Session RPE)

Collected 15–30 minutes after session completion per Foster et al. (2001) methodology. **sRPE × session duration (min) = session load (AU).**

| Data Point | How It's Used |
|---|---|
| sRPE logged | Stored in 7-day rolling average. Compared to programmed target RPE. |
| sRPE × duration = load (AU) | Acute load (7-day sum) and chronic load (28-day average) tracked. Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR) calculated weekly. |
| ACWR 0.8–1.3 | ✅ Training load in safe zone (Gabbett, 2016, *BJSM*). |
| ACWR >1.5 | 🛑 Spike detected — reduce next 3 sessions by 20% volume. |
| ACWR <0.7 | ⚠️ Detraining risk — increase next week's volume by 10–15%. |

### 1.4 Cross-Session Adaptation Rules (CR Rules)

These 18 if/then rules fire automatically based on accumulated session data. Each rule references specific thresholds, session types, and corrective actions.

#### Fatigue & Overload Rules

| Rule ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) |
|---|---|---|
| **CR-1** | RPE > 8 on 2 consecutive HIIT sessions | Reduce next HIIT session volume by 25% (remove final 2 rounds). Insert 1 additional Zone 2 run (30–40 min, RPE 3–4) before the next HIIT session. |
| **CR-2** | RPE < 5 on 3 consecutive sessions of any type | Increase intensity by 5–10% (add 5–10 sec/km to pace targets, or 5–10% to strength loads) OR add 1 additional set/round to the next 2 sessions. |
| **CR-3** | RPE ≥ 9 on any "easy" session (programmed target RPE ≤5) | Flag **overtraining investigation**: prompt athlete for illness symptoms, check 7-day sleep average, review preceding 14-day training load. If sleep avg < 6 hrs → trigger lifestyle intervention (Section 5). If no lifestyle explanation → insert 2 consecutive rest days and reduce following week volume by 30%. |
| **CR-4** | RPE > 8 on 3 out of 4 strength sessions within a 2-week block | Reduce strength training loads by 10% for the next mesocycle. Add 1 extra rest day between strength sessions. If within 4 weeks of competition, convert one strength session per week to strength-endurance (lighter load, higher rep, circuit format). |
| **CR-5** | RPE < 4 on 2 consecutive strength sessions | Increase working loads by 5–7.5% on main lifts (squat, deadlift, bench press, overhead press). Keep accessory volumes unchanged. |

#### Running-Specific Rules

| Rule ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) |
|---|---|---|
| **CR-6** | Running RPE > planned RPE by ≥2 points on 2 out of 3 runs in a week | Reduce next week's total running volume by 15–20%. Convert 1 interval/tempo run to a Zone 2 easy run. Review shoe condition and check for injury signs. |
| **CR-7** | Running RPE consistently 1–2 points below target for ≥2 weeks | Advance running pace targets by 5 sec/km. If the athlete is in General Prep, consider moving to Specific Prep running intensities early. |
| **CR-8** | Athlete reports RPE ≥ 8 on ≥3 of the 8 running segments during a simulation | Identify which running segments (early vs. late) are most affected. If segments 5–8 are elevated → increase long-run volume by 10% and add a second Zone 2 run per week. If segments 1–3 are elevated → athlete is starting too fast; prescribe pacing drill with negative-split structure. |

#### HIIT & Simulation-Specific Rules

| Rule ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) |
|---|---|---|
| **CR-9** | Average HIIT sRPE over 4-week block exceeds programmed target by >1 point | Reduce HIIT density: increase work:rest ratio from 1:1 to 1:1.5, or from 1:0.5 to 1:1 for the next 2-week block. Maintain total session duration. |
| **CR-10** | Simulation sRPE ≥ 9 AND total sim time is >10% slower than goal pace | Add 1 half-simulation per week (4 stations + 4 × 1 km) at race pace for 3 weeks, focusing on the 4 weakest stations. Reduce full-simulation frequency to every 14 days instead of every 10 days. |
| **CR-11** | Simulation sRPE ≤ 6 AND total sim time is within 5% of goal pace | Athlete is ready for progression. Increase simulation specificity: add transition drills (Roxzone efficiency practice), and in the next full sim, attempt a 2–3% negative split in running segments. |

#### Deload & Recovery Triggers

| Rule ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) |
|---|---|---|
| **CR-12** | Average weekly Readiness Score drops below 6.0 for 2 consecutive weeks | Insert an **unscheduled deload week**: reduce all volumes by 40%, reduce all intensities by 15%, replace 1 HIIT session with Zone 2 cardio, add 1 full rest day. Resume normal programming after 7 days if Readiness returns to ≥7.0. |
| **CR-13** | Readiness Score ≤ 3.9 for 3+ consecutive days | Trigger **Overtraining Investigation Protocol**: (1) Suspend all training for 48 hours. (2) Request physician clearance if illness suspected. (3) On return, apply the "Miss a Full Week" protocol (Section 2.4). (4) Log incident for macro-cycle review. |
| **CR-14** | HRV 7-day rolling average drops >1 SD below personal baseline for ≥5 consecutive days (if wearable data available) | Reduce high-intensity sessions by 50% for the following week. Replace with Zone 1–2 aerobic work. This aligns with Plews et al. (2013) findings and Kiviniemi et al. (2007, 2010) HRV-guided training research showing improved adaptation when training is reduced during periods of attenuated vagal tone. |

#### Progressive Overload Guards

| Rule ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) |
|---|---|---|
| **CR-15** | Athlete completes all sessions in a week at programmed volume/intensity with average sRPE ≤ programmed target for 3 consecutive weeks | Auto-progress: increase running volume by 5–8%, HIIT rounds by 1, or strength loads by 2.5–5% in the following week. This aligns with DeLorme's (1946) original progressive overload principles and modern autoregulation research (Greig et al., 2020, *Sports Med*). |
| **CR-16** | Athlete's ACWR exceeds 1.3 for 2 consecutive weeks | Cap the following week's acute load to ≤1.2 × chronic load. Achieve this by removing the lowest-priority session of the week. |
| **CR-17** | Readiness Score ≥ 8 for 10+ consecutive sessions AND sRPE consistently ≤ 5 | Possible under-training. Increase weekly training frequency by 1 session (add a station-specific supplemental session) OR increase session density by 10%. Monitor for 2 weeks. |
| **CR-18** | Post-session RPE deviates from target RPE by >2 points (in either direction) on ≥50% of sessions in a 2-week block | Recalibrate athlete's RPE anchoring: provide RPE education refresher, re-assess training zones with a benchmark test. If calibration seems accurate, adjust the entire plan's target RPEs to match athlete's actual response curve. |

## 2. Missed Session Recovery Logic

### 2.1 Session Priority Hierarchy by Training Phase

Every session type carries a priority rank that dictates which sessions to protect when time is limited or sessions are missed.

| Priority | General Prep (Wk 1–4) | Specific Prep (Wk 5–8) | Competition Prep (Wk 9–14) | Taper (Wk 15–16) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (Must-Do) | Long Run / Zone 2 Run | HIIT (Hyrox-style intervals) | Full/Half Simulation | Short High-Intensity Intervals (≤20 min) |
| 2 | HIIT (general conditioning) | Tempo/Threshold Run | HIIT (race-specific) | Easy Run (20–30 min) |
| 3 | Strength (full body) | Strength (functional) | Threshold Running | Mobility / Active Recovery |
| 4 | Mobility / Recovery | Mobility / Recovery | Strength (maintenance) | Everything else is optional |

### 2.2 Missed Session Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Decision Logic |
|---|---|
| **Miss 1 session in a week** | **Do NOT reschedule if it was Priority 3 or 4.** If Priority 1 or 2: compress into an adjacent day by combining it as a reduced-volume add-on (50% of original volume appended as a "bonus block" to the next session, adding ≤15 min). Never stack 2 full sessions on the same day. |
| **Miss 2 sessions in a week** | Protect the **top 2 priority sessions** for the current phase. Remove the lowest-priority remaining session. Redistribute: take the most important missed session and insert it at 75% volume on the nearest available day. Accept the second missed session as lost volume — do NOT chase it. |
| **Miss 3+ sessions (illness/travel)** | Stop chasing missed volume entirely. Re-enter training using the **Graduated Return Protocol** (Section 2.4). Assess Readiness Score on the first day back. If Readiness ≥ 7: resume at 70% of planned volume for 3 days, then 85% for 3 days, then 100%. If Readiness 5–6: resume at 50% volume for 4 days, then 70% for 3 days, then 85% for 3 days. |
| **Miss a full week** | Apply the **50/30/20/10 Return Rule** adapted from NSCA/CSCCa consensus guidelines: **Day 1–2:** 50% of normal session volume, RPE cap of 5. **Day 3–4:** 70% volume, RPE cap of 6. **Day 5–7:** 85% volume, RPE cap of 7. **Week 2:** 100% volume. No benchmark testing for ≥10 days post-return. This is supported by the graduated return-to-play protocols (Elliott et al., 2020, *BJSM*; NSCA/CSCCa Joint Guidelines). |
| **Miss 2+ weeks (injury/illness)** | Require medical clearance before resuming. On clearance: restart training at the **beginning of the previous mesocycle** at 50% volume. Progress per the 50/30/20/10 rule over 2 weeks. Reassess goal time and potentially extend the 16-week plan by the number of weeks missed. Retest all benchmarks at the 2-week post-return mark. |

### 2.3 "Which Sessions Can I Skip?" Quick Reference

| Session Type | Skip-able? | Consequence of Skipping |
|---|---|---|
| Full Simulation (Competition Prep) | ❌ Never skip | Reschedule within 3 days, even at reduced volume (half-sim) |
| HIIT — Race-Specific | ❌ Rarely skip | If must skip, replace with a 30-min threshold run to preserve metabolic stimulus |
| Long Run (>45 min) | ⚠️ Conditional | Can skip 1 per 3-week block; replace with 2 shorter Zone 2 runs |
| Strength — Main Lifts | ⚠️ Conditional | Can skip if already completed 1 strength session that week |
| Strength — Accessories | ✅ Yes | Lowest consequence; absorb into warm-up of next session as activation work |
| Easy Run / Recovery | ✅ Yes | Replace with walking or rest with zero guilt |

---

## 3. Time-Constrained Session Modifications

When an athlete reports they have less time than the planned session requires, the AI compresses the session according to the **"protect intensity, sacrifice volume"** principle (Helms et al., 2018, *JSCR*; Graham & Cleather, 2019).

### 3.1 Universal Compression Matrix

| Planned Duration | Available Time | Compression Level | General Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| 60 min | **45 min** (75%) | Moderate | Cut warm-up to 5 min (from 10), cut cool-down to 3 min (from 7–10). Remove the lowest-priority element. Keep main set at full intensity and ≥75% of prescribed volume. |
| 60 min | **30 min** (50%) | Aggressive | Warm-up = 3 min only (dynamic). Cool-down = walk for 2 min. Execute **only the main set** at full intensity with 60% of prescribed volume. All accessories/supplementary work removed. |
| 60 min | **15 min** (25%) | Emergency Minimum | No formal warm-up (begin at 50% effort, ramp over 2 min). Execute the single highest-priority element at full intensity for the maximum possible work in 10 min. 3-min cool-down walk. Log as "emergency session." |

### 3.2 Compression Rules by Session Type

#### Running Sessions

| Available Time | Modification |
|---|---|
| 45 min (from 60) | Keep main interval/tempo set unchanged. Cut warm-up jog from 10 min to 5 min. Cut cool-down from 10 min to 5 min. Remove any strides/drills. |
| 30 min | 3-min warm-up jog → Execute main set at prescribed intensity (e.g., tempo or intervals) for 22 min → 5-min easy jog cool-down. If tempo run: maintain pace, shorten distance proportionally. |
| 15 min | 2-min build-up jog → 10 min at threshold pace (RPE 7–8) → 3-min walk. Preserves top-end aerobic stimulus. |

#### HIIT Sessions

| Available Time | Modification |
|---|---|
| 45 min (from 60) | Keep all prescribed movements. Reduce total rounds by 2 (e.g., 6 rounds → 4 rounds). Maintain prescribed work:rest ratio and intensity. |
| 30 min | Keep the 4 most Hyrox-relevant movements, remove any supplemental/accessory exercises. Perform 3 rounds at prescribed intensity. Rest periods shortened by 15 sec each. |
| 15 min | **"Hyrox Essentials" EMOM:** 10-min EMOM alternating between sled push simulation (30 sec max effort) and wall balls (20 reps) + 5-min cool-down. |

#### Strength Sessions

| Available Time | Modification |
|---|---|
| 45 min (from 60) | Keep all main compound lifts (squat, deadlift, press). Remove all accessories (curls, lateral raises, etc.). Keep programmed sets, reps, and loads for main lifts. |
| 30 min | Select the 2 most relevant main lifts (lower body + upper body). Perform programmed sets and loads. Superset where possible to save time. |
| 15 min | Perform 1 compound lift only (prioritize the weakest pattern). 3 working sets at programmed intensity. Example: 3 × 5 back squat at prescribed load. Done in <12 min. |

#### Simulation Sessions

| Available Time | Modification |
|---|---|
| 45 min (from 60) | **Half-simulation:** 4 × 1 km run + 4 stations. Select the 4 weakest stations based on most recent benchmark data. Execute at full race pace. |
| 30 min | **Quarter-simulation:** 2 × 1 km run + 2 stations (the 2 weakest). Full race effort. Plus 5-min cool-down jog. |
| 15 min | **Single-station drill:** 1 km run at race pace → 1 full station at race effort → 1 km run at race pace. Choose the single weakest station. |

---

## 4. Performance-Based Plan Adjustments

### 4.1 Benchmark Test Schedule

The AI coach schedules benchmark tests at the end of every 4-week block (Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 15 for final check).

| Benchmark Test | What It Measures | Protocol |
|---|---|---|
| 5 km Time Trial | Aerobic running fitness | Outdoor or treadmill, best effort, record time and average pace |
| Individual Station Tests | Station-specific performance | Each Hyrox station performed in isolation: SkiErg 1,000 m, Row 1,000 m, Sled Push 50 m, Sled Pull 50 m, Burpee Broad Jumps 80 m, Farmer's Carry 200 m, Lunges 100 m, Wall Balls 100 reps (men) / 100 reps (women). Record time for each. |
| Half Simulation | Race-day readiness | 4 × 1 km run + 4 stations, timed. |
| Full Simulation | Goal pace validation | All 8 × 1 km + 8 stations, timed (every 6–8 weeks max). |

### 4.2 Performance-Based Adjustment Rules

| Rule ID | Condition (IF) | Action (THEN) |
|---|---|---|
| **PB-1** | 5 km running pace improves >5% at monthly benchmark | Advance to next phase's running intensity targets immediately. E.g., if in General Prep, adopt Specific Prep pace zones. Recalculate all interval paces based on new benchmark. |
| **PB-2** | 5 km running pace regresses >3% at monthly benchmark | Investigate: check ACWR for overtraining spike, review sleep/stress data. If ACWR >1.4 → insert a deload week. If ACWR normal → add 1 additional easy run per week to build aerobic base. Retest in 2 weeks. |
| **PB-3** | Any individual station time stagnates (≤1% improvement) for 4+ weeks | Add a **targeted station intervention block**: 2 additional station-specific sessions per week for 3 weeks (15–20 min each), placed on existing training days as add-ons. Example: if SkiErg stagnates → add 2 × SkiErg-focused sessions (5 × 200 m intervals at RPE 8 with 90-sec rest). |
| **PB-4** | Full simulation time is >15% slower than goal pace | Reassess goal pace — it may be unrealistic. If goal remains valid, shift training emphasis: increase simulation frequency to every 10 days, add 1 half-sim per week, and reduce general strength to maintenance (1×/week). |
| **PB-5** | Full simulation time is within 5% of goal pace with 6+ weeks remaining | Athlete is ahead of schedule. Maintain current approach; do not increase training load unnecessarily. Focus remaining weeks on race-day tactics: pacing, transitions, nutrition strategy. Consider targeting a faster goal if athlete is motivated. |
| **PB-6** | One station time is >20% slower than the athlete's tier-adjusted average | Trigger **Station-Specific Intervention** (see Weakness Identification Matrix below). Dedicate 3 supplemental sessions/week to that station for a 3-week block. |
| **PB-7** | Athlete improves by >10% on a previously weak station after intervention | Return station to normal training frequency. Reallocate supplemental time to the next-weakest station or general conditioning. |

### 4.3 Weakness Identification Matrix

This matrix compares the athlete's individual station times against tier-normative data to compute a **Station Performance Index (SPI)** for each station. SPI = (Athlete's Station Time / Tier Average Station Time) × 100. An SPI of 100 = exactly average for their tier. SPI > 115 = significantly weak. SPI < 90 = relative strength.

**Tier norms** are based on published Hyrox results data and categorized by goal finish time:

| Station | Elite (<70 min) | Competitive (70–85 min) | Intermediate (85–100 min) | Beginner (100–120 min) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SkiErg 1,000 m | 3:15 | 3:50 | 4:30 | 5:30 |
| Sled Push 50 m | 1:30 | 2:15 | 3:15 | 4:30 |
| Sled Pull 50 m | 1:20 | 2:00 | 3:00 | 4:15 |
| Burpee Broad Jumps 80 m | 3:00 | 4:00 | 5:30 | 7:00 |
| Row 1,000 m | 3:20 | 3:55 | 4:30 | 5:30 |
| Farmer's Carry 200 m | 1:30 | 2:00 | 2:45 | 3:30 |
| Lunges 100 m | 3:00 | 4:15 | 5:45 | 7:30 |
| Wall Balls 100 reps | 4:00 | 5:30 | 7:00 | 9:00 |

**Interpretation Rules:**

| SPI Range | Classification | AI Coach Action |
|---|---|---|
| SPI < 90 | 🟢 Relative Strength | Maintain current training. No extra work needed. |
| SPI 90–105 | ⚪ On Track | Standard programming. |
| SPI 106–115 | 🟡 Developing Weakness | Add 1 supplemental station drill per week (10–15 min). |
| SPI 116–130 | 🟠 Significant Weakness | Add 2 supplemental station drills per week. Investigate root cause: is it a strength issue (sled), endurance issue (SkiErg/row), or technique issue (burpee broad jumps, wall balls)? |
| SPI > 130 | 🔴 Critical Weakness | Dedicate 3 sessions/week to this station for 3 weeks. Reduce general strength to maintenance. This station becomes the #1 training priority regardless of phase. |

---

## 5. Environmental & Lifestyle Adaptation

### 5.1 High Stress Week (Work, Life Events)

The AI detects this when the "Life Stress" sub-score in the Readiness Check averages ≤ 4 over 3+ consecutive days.

| Action | Specification |
|---|---|
| Reduce weekly training volume by **25–30%** | Remove the lowest-priority session entirely. Shorten remaining sessions by 15–20%. |
| Reduce high-intensity work by **40%** | Convert 1 HIIT session to Zone 2 cardio. Keep 1 quality session (the most important for current phase). |
| Add recovery modalities | Prescribe 10-min post-session breathwork (box breathing: 4-4-4-4 cadence). Recommend magnesium supplementation and sleep hygiene review. |
| Duration | Maintain modifications until Life Stress score returns to ≥6 for 2+ consecutive days. |

### 5.2 Poor Sleep (<6 Hours)

Detected via Sleep Quality sub-score ≤ 4, or direct athlete report.

| Sleep Duration | Session Modification |
|---|---|
| 5–6 hours (1 night) | Reduce session intensity by 5–10%. Extend warm-up by 5 min. Proceed with caution; monitor mid-session RPE. |
| <5 hours (1 night) | Downgrade session by one Readiness Tier (e.g., Green → Yellow). Cap session RPE at 7. |
| <6 hours for 3+ consecutive nights | Apply Orange-tier modifications to ALL sessions until sleep normalizes. Add 1 rest day. Provide sleep hygiene education: consistent bedtime, no screens 1 hr before bed, cool bedroom (18–20°C), caffeine cutoff by 1:00 PM. |
| <5 hours for 3+ consecutive nights | Red-tier: recovery sessions only until sleep improves. Investigate underlying cause (stress, medical, schedule). |

### 5.3 Traveling (Limited Equipment)

When the athlete flags travel status, the AI serves one of three **travel workout templates** based on available equipment:

#### Hotel Gym (Treadmill + Dumbbells + Cable Machine)

| Day | Session (30–40 min) |
|---|---|
| 1 | Treadmill intervals: 6 × 3 min at threshold pace / 2 min easy. DB lunges 3 × 12/leg. DB farmer's carry 3 × 40 m. |
| 2 | Recovery: 20-min easy treadmill jog + 15-min mobility routine. |
| 3 | DB circuit: 4 rounds of 10 goblet squats, 10 DB push press, 10 DB rows, 15 wall balls (sub: DB thrusters), 200-m treadmill run between rounds. |

#### Bodyweight Only (Hotel Room / Park)

| Day | Session (20–30 min) |
|---|---|
| 1 | AMRAP 20 min: 10 burpee broad jumps, 20 air squats, 15 push-ups, 200-m run (or 40 high knees). |
| 2 | 30-min easy run at conversational pace (outdoor or treadmill). |
| 3 | 4 × 4-min Tabata blocks (20 sec work / 10 sec rest): block 1 = jump squats; block 2 = mountain climbers; block 3 = walking lunges; block 4 = burpees. 2-min rest between blocks. |

#### Minimal Equipment (Resistance Band + Jump Rope)

| Day | Session (25–35 min) |
|---|---|
| 1 | Jump rope intervals: 8 × 1 min fast / 30 sec rest. Band pull-aparts 3 × 20. Band-resisted squats 3 × 15. Band rows 3 × 15. |
| 2 | 25-min easy run + band-assisted stretching 10 min. |
| 3 | Circuit: 5 rounds of 30-sec jump rope sprint, 10 band-resisted lunges per leg, 10 band push-ups, 15 band rows. 60-sec rest between rounds. |

**Travel rule:** No more than 2 consecutive rest days while traveling. If equipment is zero, at minimum perform 20 min of bodyweight movement daily.

### 5.4 Hot Weather Training (>30°C / 86°F)

Supported by Periard et al. (2015, *Sports Med*) heat acclimatization guidelines.

| Adjustment | Specification |
|---|---|
| Reduce running pace by **8–12%** for the first 5 sessions in heat | Allow cardiac drift without chasing normal pace. RPE should guide effort, not GPS pace. |
| Reduce HIIT volume by **20%** for first week in heat | Add 30-sec additional rest between intervals. |
| Hydration protocol | Pre-session: 500 ml water with electrolytes 2 hrs before. During: 200 ml every 15–20 min. Post: 1.5 × body weight lost in fluid. |
| Acclimatization timeline | After 7–10 sessions in heat, begin restoring normal pace/volume in 5% increments per session. Full acclimatization expected by 14 sessions (Racinais et al., 2015). |
| RPE recalibration | Expect RPE to be 1–2 points higher than normal for same workload in heat. Do NOT adjust target RPE downward — use actual RPE to drive autoregulation normally. |

### 5.5 Altitude Training (>1,500 m / 5,000 ft)

| Altitude | Adjustment |
|---|---|
| 1,500–2,000 m | Reduce running pace by 5–8%. Reduce HIIT intensity by 10%. Expect RPE +1 for same effort. Allow 3–5 days for initial acclimatization. |
| 2,000–2,500 m | Reduce running pace by 10–15%. Reduce all high-intensity volume by 20%. Increase hydration by 50%. Allow 7–10 days for acclimatization. Monitor SpO2 if possible. |
| >2,500 m | Reduce all intensity by 15–20%. Limit sessions to 45 min for first 5 days. If SpO2 drops below 88% during exercise → stop and descend. |

### 5.6 Return from Minor Illness Protocol

Based on Elliott et al. (2020, *BJSM*) graduated return-to-play framework and Schwellnus et al. (2016) return-after-infection guidelines. The athlete must be symptom-free for ≥48 hours before beginning this protocol.

| Day Post-Clearance | Session |
|---|---|
| Day 1 | 15-min easy walk + 10-min light stretching/mobility. Target RPE ≤ 3. |
| Day 2 | 20-min easy jog or bike at HR < Zone 1 ceiling (< 65% max HR). Target RPE ≤ 4. |
| Day 3 | 30-min Zone 2 run (RPE 4–5). If RPE ≥ 6 → return to Day 2 protocol for another day. |
| Day 4 | 40-min session at 60% normal volume and 80% normal intensity. Include light strength (bodyweight or 50% normal loads). |
| Day 5 | 50-min session at 75% normal volume, 90% normal intensity. |
| Day 6 | Resume full programming if Readiness Score ≥ 7. If Readiness < 7, repeat Day 5. |

**Hard rule:** If symptoms return at any stage → return to Day 1 and add 48 hours of rest. If fever occurs → medical clearance required before any exercise resumes.

## 6. Communication Templates

The AI coach uses these templates to explain adaptations clearly, building trust and compliance. Every message follows the **"Observation → Reasoning → Action → Reassurance"** framework.

### Template 1: Elevated RPE Pattern

> **"I've noticed your RPE has been higher than expected this week.** Your last 3 sessions averaged RPE 8.2 against a target of 6.5. This tells me your body is accumulating more fatigue than planned — which is totally normal and happens to every athlete.
>
> **Here's what I'm adjusting:** I'm reducing your HIIT volume by 25% for the next session and swapping Thursday's tempo run for an easy Zone 2 run. This gives your body the recovery signal it needs without losing fitness.
>
> **You're not falling behind.** Strategic pullbacks like this are how the best athletes stay consistent across a 16-week block. We'll reassess at Monday's readiness check."

### Template 2: Missed Session Restructure

> **"You missed Tuesday's HIIT session — no worries, life happens.** Since we're in Specific Prep, HIIT is our top priority this week. Here's how I've restructured your week:
>
> **Wednesday:** I've added a condensed 30-min HIIT block (4 rounds instead of 6) after your strength session. **Friday:** Stays as planned — your long run is still locked in. **Saturday's easy run:** Removed to give you recovery time after the compressed week.
>
> **Net result:** You'll still hit 80% of your planned weekly training stimulus. That's more than enough to keep progressing."

### Template 3: Station Weakness Detected

> **"Your sled push time hasn't improved in 3 weeks** — you're at 3:45 for 50 m, while your tier target is 3:15. Your other stations have been improving steadily, so this is a specific weak link, not a fitness problem.
>
> **Here's my plan:** I'm adding two 15-min sled-focused sessions per week for the next 3 weeks. These include heavy sled pushes at short distances (3 × 15 m) for power, and full 50 m pushes at race weight for pacing. I've also added hip drive and quad-strengthening work (front squats, split squats).
>
> **Why this works:** Station-specific block training has been shown to produce faster improvements than general conditioning. We'll retest in 3 weeks."

### Template 4: Deload Week Prescribed

> **"Your body is asking for a recovery week, and I'm listening.** Your readiness scores have averaged 5.8 for the past 14 days, and your session RPEs have been running 1.5 points above target. These are classic signs of accumulated fatigue.
>
> **This week's plan:** All sessions are reduced to 60% of normal volume. Intensity drops by 15%. Wednesday's HIIT becomes a 30-min easy bike or swim. I've added an extra rest day on Friday.
>
> **This isn't a step backward — it's a supercompensation opportunity.** Research shows that well-timed deload weeks lead to performance breakthroughs in the following block. You'll come back stronger."

### Template 5: Goal Pace Reassessment

> **"Let's talk about your goal time.** Your last full simulation came in at 1:52:30, and your target is 1:30:00 — that's a 25% gap with 8 weeks remaining. While big improvements are possible, closing a gap this large requires us to be realistic.
>
> **My recommendation:** Let's reset your goal to 1:42:00, which represents a strong 10% improvement and keeps you on a sustainable trajectory. If you hit 1:42 ahead of schedule, we'll push further.
>
> **What changes:** I'm shifting your running pace zones to align with a 1:42 finish. I'm also adding a weekly half-sim to build race-specific conditioning faster. Let's crush this new target."

### Template 6: Hot Weather Adjustment

> **"I see you're training in 33°C heat this week.** Your pace will naturally feel harder — that's not you getting weaker, it's your body redirecting blood to cool itself. It's physiology, not fitness loss.
>
> **Adjustments for this week:** All running paces drop by 10% (your 5:00/km tempo becomes 5:30/km). HIIT rest periods increase by 30 seconds. I need you drinking 500 ml with electrolytes 2 hours before each session and 200 ml every 15 minutes during.
>
> **Good news:** After 7–10 sessions in this heat, your body adapts and performance returns to normal. Heat training actually improves blood plasma volume — you'll be fitter for it."

### Template 7: Return from Illness

> **"Welcome back! I know being sick is frustrating, but rushing back causes more problems than patience does.** Here's your 6-day return protocol:
>
> **Today (Day 1):** 15-min walk + 10-min gentle stretching. That's it. **Tomorrow:** 20-min easy jog, heart rate under 130 bpm. **Days 3–6:** Gradual ramp-up to full training.
>
> **The rule:** If at any point you feel worse than the day before, we pause and repeat the previous day's session. No exceptions. I'd rather have you 100% for the final 6 weeks than at 70% for 8 weeks."

### Template 8: Positive Progress Acknowledgment

> **"Your benchmark results just came in, and they're excellent.** Your 5 km time dropped from 24:30 to 23:15 — that's a 5.1% improvement in 4 weeks. Your SkiErg dropped from 4:45 to 4:22. This tells me your aerobic engine is building exactly as planned.
>
> **What this unlocks:** I'm advancing your running intensity targets to Specific Prep levels starting this week. Your interval paces move from 4:50/km to 4:40/km. Everything else stays the same — no need to change what's working."

### Template 9: Time-Compressed Session Served

> **"Got it — you only have 30 minutes today instead of 60. Here's your compressed session:**
>
> **3-min dynamic warm-up → 22 min of today's main set at full intensity → 5-min cool-down jog.** I've removed the accessories and shortened the warm-up, but the core training stimulus is preserved. Research shows that maintaining intensity with reduced volume still drives adaptation (Helms et al., 2018).
>
> **What you lose:** About 15% of today's training benefit. **What you keep:** 85% of the stimulus, and you stay on track. A 30-min session always beats a skipped session."

### Template 10: Travel Workout Delivered

> **"I see you're traveling this week. I've built 3 hotel-friendly sessions that require only dumbbells and a treadmill:**
>
> **Session 1 (Mon):** Treadmill intervals + DB lunges + DB carries — 35 min. **Session 2 (Wed):** Recovery jog + mobility flow — 25 min. **Session 3 (Fri):** DB circuit mimicking Hyrox stations — 30 min.
>
> **These sessions maintain your conditioning base without requiring any specialized equipment.** When you're back, we'll slot right back into the normal plan. Travel weeks are maintenance weeks, not growth weeks — and that's perfectly fine."

### Template 11: Under-Training Flag

> **"I want to flag something positive: your RPE has been consistently below 5, and your readiness scores have been 8+ for 10 straight sessions.** This means either the training load isn't challenging enough, or you're in a great phase of adaptation.
>
> **Here's what I'm testing:** I'm adding 1 extra round to your next 2 HIIT sessions and bumping your running intervals by 5 sec/km faster. If your RPE stays under 6 after these changes, we'll make a larger adjustment.
>
> **This is a great 'problem' to have.** It means you're adapting faster than projected."

### Template 12: ACWR Spike Warning

> **"Your training load has spiked over the past 7 days — your Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio is at 1.52, which puts you in an elevated injury-risk zone** (safe range is 0.8–1.3 per Gabbett, 2016).
>
> **Immediate adjustments:** I'm reducing your next 3 sessions by 20% volume. Tomorrow's HIIT drops from 6 rounds to 5. Thursday's run shortens from 8 km to 6.5 km. This brings your ACWR back to ~1.25 by Sunday.
>
> **This is protective, not punitive.** Load spikes are the #1 predictor of soft-tissue injury. A small pullback now protects weeks of training ahead."

## Original Prompt

```
You are a training program designer building the adaptive intelligence layer for an AI-powered Hyrox coach. The coach already has a 16-week periodization plan with HIIT workouts and simulation sessions. What's MISSING is the decision-making logic that allows the AI to ADAPT the plan in real time based on athlete feedback.

Your task is to create a comprehensive autoregulation and adaptive programming framework.

## 1. RPE-Based Session Modification Rules

Create a complete decision tree for modifying training sessions based on athlete-reported RPE (1-10 scale):

### Pre-Session Readiness Check
- How to assess readiness: questions the AI should ask before each session
- Readiness score framework (1-10) based on: sleep quality, soreness, motivation, stress, nutrition
- Modification tiers:
  - Readiness 8-10: Execute session as planned
  - Readiness 6-7: Modify (specify HOW — reduce volume? intensity? swap session type?)
  - Readiness 4-5: Significant modification (what changes?)
  - Readiness 1-3: Replace with recovery session (specify what)

### During-Session RPE Monitoring
- After warm-up RPE check: if warm-up feels RPE 7+ when it should be 4-5, what adjustments?
- Mid-session RPE check: rules for when to cut a session short
- Post-session RPE: how to log and use for future planning

### Cross-Session Adaptation Rules
Create at least 15 specific if/then rules:
- "If RPE > 8 on 2 consecutive HIIT sessions → reduce next HIIT volume by 25% and add 1 Zone 2 run"
- "If RPE < 5 on 3 consecutive sessions → increase intensity by 5-10% or add volume"
- "If athlete reports RPE 9+ on easy runs → investigate: overtraining, poor sleep, or illness"
- Continue with 12+ more rules covering: strength sessions, running, HIIT, simulations, deload triggers

## 2. Missed Session Recovery Logic

Athletes miss sessions. The AI coach needs rules for how to recover:
- Miss 1 session in a week: what to do (skip it? compress?)
- Miss 2 sessions: restructure the week — which sessions are priority?
- Miss 3+ sessions (illness/travel): how to re-enter training
- Miss a full week: modified return protocol
- Which session types are "must-do" vs "nice-to-have" in each training phase
- Priority hierarchy by phase:
  - General Prep: running > HIIT > strength
  - Specific Prep: HIIT > running > strength
  - Competition Prep: simulation > HIIT > running > strength
  - Taper: short intense > easy running > everything else

## 3. Time-Constrained Session Modifications

Athletes often have less time than planned. Rules for compression:
- 60-minute session compressed to 45 minutes: what to cut?
- 60-minute session compressed to 30 minutes: minimum effective dose
- 60-minute session compressed to 15 minutes: "emergency minimum" protocol
- Rules by session type:
  - Running: cut warm-up/cool-down, keep main set intensity
  - HIIT: reduce rounds/sets, keep movement selection and intensity
  - Strength: reduce accessories, keep main lifts
  - Simulation: convert to half-sim with key stations only

## 4. Performance-Based Plan Adjustments

The AI coach needs to adjust the 16-week plan based on benchmark test results:
- If running pace improves >5% at monthly test → advance to next phase's running intensity
- If station time stagnates for 4+ weeks → add targeted supplemental work
- If simulation time is >15% off goal pace → reassess goal, adjust training emphasis
- If one station is disproportionately slow → create station-specific intervention block
- Create a "weakness identification matrix": how to compare an athlete's station times to their tier norms and identify which stations need extra work

## 5. Environmental & Lifestyle Adaptation

- High stress week at work: reduce training volume by what %?
- Poor sleep (<6 hours): specific session modifications
- Traveling (limited equipment): travel workout protocols
- Hot weather training: heat acclimatization adjustments
- Altitude training considerations (if applicable)
- Coming back from minor illness: return-to-training protocol

## 6. Communication Templates

How should the AI coach communicate adaptations to the athlete?
- "I noticed your RPE has been elevated this week. Here's what I'm adjusting and why..."
- "You missed Tuesday's session. Here's how I've restructured your week..."
- "Your sled push time hasn't improved in 3 weeks. I'm adding targeted work..."
- Provide 10+ template responses for common adaptation scenarios

IMPORTANT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Length: At minimum 4,000 words. This is the AI coach's decision-making brain.
- Format: Use markdown tables for decision trees. Use "IF → THEN" format for all rules.
- Every rule must be SPECIFIC and QUANTIFIED — no vague "adjust accordingly."
- Include at least 30 total decision rules across all sections.
- This document will be directly embedded as the AI coach's autoregulation logic.
- Cite sports science research supporting autoregulation approaches (RPE research, HRV studies, etc.).
```
