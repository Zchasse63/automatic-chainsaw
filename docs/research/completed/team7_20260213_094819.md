## 1.1 EMOM (Every Minute on the Minute)

### When to Use EMOM Format

EMOMs are ideal when the training goal requires **consistent, repeatable efforts with built-in rest**. They excel at:

- **Skill and movement quality under mild fatigue** — the clock resets each minute, preventing technique from degrading too far (Glassman, CrossFit Level 1 Training Guide).
- **Pacing discipline** — athletes learn to maintain a fixed output, critical for Hyrox's 8-station format where pacing errors compound.
- **Strength-endurance development** — sub-maximal loads repeated for moderate volume with incomplete rest.
- **Aerobic power (VO2max intervals)** — when work bouts are 40–50 sec with 10–20 sec transitions, the oxidative system is heavily taxed (Seiler & Sjursen, 2004).

**Avoid EMOM when:** the goal is maximal sustained output without breaks (use AMRAP instead) or when movements are so complex that a clock-imposed pace creates injury risk.

### Time Domain Guidelines

| EMOM Duration | Purpose | Athlete Readiness |
|---|---|---|
| **8 min** | Skill-focused or high-intensity power work. Short enough that athletes can maintain near-maximal effort each minute. Good for phosphagen/glycolytic overlap. | All levels |
| **12–16 min** | The "sweet spot" for Hyrox-specific conditioning. Mirrors the glycolytic-oxidative transition zone (2–4 min cumulative work). Develops the ability to repeat moderate efforts. | Intermediate+ |
| **20–24 min** | Aerobic endurance emphasis. Teaches pacing over long durations. The accumulated fatigue in later minutes reveals pacing errors. Simulates Hyrox race duration in a controlled structure. | Intermediate+ with solid movement foundations |
| **30+ min** | Long aerobic sessions or "EMOM grinders." Only for well-conditioned athletes. Useful in peak Hyrox prep blocks. | Advanced only |

### Work:Rest Ratio Within Each Minute

The fundamental constraint: **work must fit within the minute** and leave enough rest for the athlete to sustain quality across all rounds.

| Athlete Level | Target Work per Minute | Rest per Minute | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Beginner | 25–35 sec | 25–35 sec | Err toward more rest; quality > volume |
| Intermediate | 30–40 sec | 20–30 sec | The "goldilocks zone" for conditioning |
| Advanced | 40–50 sec | 10–20 sec | High accumulated density; demanding |

**Programming rule:** Estimate the athlete's rep speed, multiply by prescribed reps, and confirm the total fits within the target work window. If a movement takes 3 sec/rep (e.g., wall balls), then 10 reps = 30 sec work → appropriate for intermediate athletes.

### Movement Count Per Minute

| Format | Description | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| **1 movement/min (alternating)** | Min 1: Movement A, Min 2: Movement B, repeat | Push/pull pairing, upper/lower alternating, maximizing local recovery |
| **2 movements/min (couplet within)** | Each minute: do A + B, rest remaining time | Higher metabolic demand, Hyrox station simulation (e.g., row + wall ball) |
| **3 movements/min** | Rarely recommended — only for short EMOMs (8 min) with very low reps | Advanced athletes, skill-focused |

### Movement Pairing Rules for EMOM

| Pairing Strategy | Example | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Push + Pull (alternating minutes)** | Min 1: Push-ups / Min 2: Ring Rows | Opposing muscle groups recover while the other works |
| **Upper + Lower (alternating)** | Min 1: DB Push Press / Min 2: Goblet Squats | Local muscular recovery; high systemic output |
| **Engine + Strength (alternating)** | Min 1: 15-cal Row / Min 2: 8 DB Deadlifts | Mirrors Hyrox's run→station format |
| **Same-station simulation** | Every min: 10 Wall Balls + 5 Burpees | High fatigue, competition simulation |

**Avoid:** Stacking movements that share the same grip demand (deadlifts + pull-ups) or lower back demand (KB swings + rowing) within the same minute.

### Rep Scheme Design

**The Golden Rule:** Reps should allow completion in the target work window with good form.

| Movement Speed Category | Examples | Typical Reps per Minute |
|---|---|---|
| **Fast cyclical** (~1.5–2 sec/rep) | Wall balls, box jumps, burpees | 10–15 reps |
| **Moderate grind** (~2.5–3.5 sec/rep) | KB swings, thrusters, push-ups | 8–12 reps |
| **Slow/heavy** (~4–5 sec/rep) | Deadlifts, heavy lunges, strict press | 5–8 reps |
| **Machine/monostructural** | Row, SkiErg, bike | 12–18 cal or set distance |

### Progression Methods (Week Over Week)

| Progression Variable | Method | Rate |
|---|---|---|
| **Add reps** | +1–2 reps per movement per week | Weeks 1–3 of a block |
| **Add load** | +2.5–5 kg per movement per week | For strength-endurance focus |
| **Reduce rest (E2MOM → EMOM)** | Start every 2 min, progress to every 90 sec, then every 60 sec | Across a 4-week block |
| **Extend duration** | 12-min EMOM → 16-min → 20-min | Across mesocycle |
| **Increase complexity** | Single movement → couplet within each minute | When base fitness supports it |

### 3 Example EMOMs

#### Example 1: Hyrox Station Pairing EMOM (Intermediate)

**Goal:** Aerobic power development + Hyrox station familiarity
**Duration:** 16 minutes (8 rounds)

```
EMOM 16:
  Min 1: 15/12-cal SkiErg
  Min 2: 12 Wall Balls (20/14 lb to 10/9 ft target)
```

**Design Reasoning:**
- 2-movement alternating format allows local recovery (pulling → pushing/squatting).
- 15-cal SkiErg ≈ 35–40 sec for intermediate athletes → leaves 20–25 sec rest.
- 12 wall balls ≈ 30–35 sec → leaves 25–30 sec rest.
- Both movements directly simulate Hyrox stations.
- 16 min = meaningful aerobic adaptation without excessive CNS fatigue.

**Scaling:**
- Beginner: 10/8-cal SkiErg, 8 Wall Balls (14/10 lb)
- Advanced: 18/15-cal SkiErg, 15 Wall Balls (20/14 lb)

---

#### Example 2: Strength-Endurance EMOM (Advanced)

**Goal:** Strength-endurance under fatigue; heavy farmer carry + lunge prep
**Duration:** 20 minutes (5 rounds)

```
EMOM 20:
  Min 1: 8 Heavy KB Deadlifts (2x32/24 kg)
  Min 2: 50m Farmer Carry (2x32/24 kg)
  Min 3: 12 Alternating DB Lunges (2x22.5/15 kg)
  Min 4: 15/12-cal Row
```

**Design Reasoning:**
- 4-movement rotation → each muscle group gets 3 minutes of recovery before repeating.
- Deadlift → carry → lunge progression loads the posterior chain and legs in different patterns.
- Row in minute 4 provides active recovery for legs (seated) while maintaining cardiac output.
- Heavy loads develop specific Hyrox strength (sled push/pull, sandbag carry/lunge transfer).

**Scaling:**
- Beginner: Reduce to EMOM 12 (3 rounds), lighter loads by 30–40%
- Intermediate: EMOM 16 (4 rounds), moderate loads

---

#### Example 3: Speed/Power EMOM (All Levels)

**Goal:** Alactic power development; fast-twitch recruitment for burpee broad jumps
**Duration:** 8 minutes

```
EMOM 8:
  Min 1: 5 Burpee Broad Jumps (max distance per jump)
  Min 2: 10 Russian KB Swings (24/16 kg, explosive)
```

**Design Reasoning:**
- Short 8-min domain → athletes can maintain maximal intent each minute.
- 5 burpee broad jumps ≈ 20–25 sec → 35+ sec rest → sufficient for near-full phosphagen recovery.
- KB swings complement: hip extension power without the ground-to-standing transition.
- Focus on QUALITY and POWER, not grinding through fatigue.

**Scaling:**
- Beginner: 3 Burpee Broad Jumps, 8 KB Swings (16/12 kg)
- Advanced: 7 Burpee Broad Jumps, 12 KB Swings (32/24 kg)

---

## 1.2 AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible)

### When to Use AMRAP Format

AMRAPs are optimal when the goal is **maximal sustained output over a fixed time domain**. They inherently teach pacing — athletes who go too hard early slow down; those who pace well accumulate more work. This directly transfers to Hyrox race strategy (Bergeron, 2016).

Best applications:
- **Aerobic capacity development** — longer AMRAPs (12–20 min) build the oxidative engine.
- **Mental toughness and pacing** — athletes must manage fatigue, exactly as in Hyrox.
- **Benchmarking and progress tracking** — score = total rounds + reps; easy to compare over time.
- **Competition simulation** — self-paced effort under time pressure.

### Time Domain Guidelines

| AMRAP Duration | Purpose | Character |
|---|---|---|
| **5 min** | Glycolytic power. Fast, aggressive. Athletes should feel like they're redlining by min 3. Tests anaerobic capacity. | Sprint |
| **8–12 min** | The Hyrox "station block" simulator. Glycolytic-oxidative transition. Teaches moderate-hard pacing. | Threshold |
| **15–20 min** | Aerobic capacity. Sustainable pace. Must plan transitions. Most transferable to full Hyrox race pacing. | Sustained |
| **25–30 min** | Long aerobic grinder. Only for advanced athletes in peak prep. Tests mental fortitude + fueling. | Endurance |

### Movement Count

| Count | Style | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| **2 movements (couplet)** | Fast cycling, high cardiac output | Short AMRAPs (5–12 min). Simple decision-making under fatigue. |
| **3 movements (triplet)** | Balanced loading, more variety | Medium AMRAPs (10–20 min). Can alternate body regions. |
| **4+ movements (chipper-style)** | Each round is a mini-journey | Long AMRAPs (15–30 min). Prevents monotony. Mimics Hyrox multi-station feel. |

### Rep Scheme Design: Avoiding Bottlenecks

**Key Principle:** No single movement should take more than ~40% of the round's total time. If one movement dominates, athletes stall there and the workout loses its intended stimulus.

**Formula:**
1. Estimate time per rep for each movement.
2. Multiply by prescribed reps.
3. Calculate each movement's % of total round time.
4. Adjust reps until balanced (each movement = 25–40% of round time in a triplet).

| Movement | Time/Rep | Reps | Time | % of Round |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Row (calories) | ~4 sec/cal | 12 cal | 48 sec | 38% |
| Wall Balls | ~3 sec | 12 | 36 sec | 28% |
| Burpees | ~5 sec | 8 | 40 sec | 32% |
| **Total** | | | **~2:04/round** | |

This is balanced. If burpees were 15 reps (75 sec), they'd dominate the round at 50%+ → reduce to 8–10.

### Scoring: Target Scores by Fitness Level

For a ~2:00/round AMRAP:

| Duration | Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced | Elite |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5 min | 2 rounds | 2+½ rounds | 3 rounds | 3+½ rounds |
| 12 min | 4–5 rounds | 6 rounds | 7–8 rounds | 9+ rounds |
| 20 min | 7–8 rounds | 9–10 rounds | 11–13 rounds | 14+ rounds |

### Progression Methods

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| **Add reps** | Same time, more work per round → fewer rounds but more total volume |
| **Add load** | Heavier wall ball, heavier KB → slower rounds, more strength stimulus |
| **Extend time** | 12-min AMRAP → 16-min → 20-min |
| **Increase movement complexity** | Burpees → burpee broad jumps; squats → lunges |
| **Beat previous score** | Same workout, aim for +1 round or +5 reps |

### 3 Example AMRAPs

#### Example 1: Hyrox Race Simulation AMRAP (Intermediate)

**Goal:** Full-race pacing practice; aerobic capacity
**Duration:** 20 min AMRAP

```
20-min AMRAP:
  200m Run
  15 Wall Balls (20/14 lb)
  12/10-cal SkiErg
  10 Alternating DB Lunges (2x15/10 kg)
```

**Design Reasoning:**
- 4 movements mimic the Hyrox run→station flow.
- Estimated round time: ~2:30–3:00 → target 7–8 rounds for intermediate.
- Run opens each round (just like Hyrox). Wall balls and SkiErg are direct station simulators. Lunges simulate the sandbag lunge station.
- No single movement dominates: run ≈ 50 sec, wall balls ≈ 45 sec, SkiErg ≈ 40 sec, lunges ≈ 35 sec.

**Scaling:**
- Beginner: 100m Run, 10 Wall Balls (14/10 lb), 8/6-cal SkiErg, 8 Goblet Lunges (light)
- Advanced: 250m Run, 15 Wall Balls (20/14 lb), 15/12-cal SkiErg, 12 Lunges (2x22.5/15 kg)

---

#### Example 2: Short Glycolytic Blast (All Levels)

**Goal:** Anaerobic capacity; fast turnover; burpee tolerance
**Duration:** 5 min AMRAP

```
5-min AMRAP:
  5 Burpee Broad Jumps
  10 KB Swings (24/16 kg)
```

**Design Reasoning:**
- Couplet for simplicity → minimal transition time → maximum output.
- 5 burpee broad jumps ≈ 25 sec; 10 KB swings ≈ 20 sec → ~45 sec/round.
- Target: 5–7 rounds. Athletes should feel anaerobic distress by round 4.
- Direct Hyrox transfer: burpee broad jump station + hip extension power.

**Scaling:**
- Beginner: 3 Burpees (no broad jump), 8 KB Swings (16/12 kg)
- Advanced: 7 Burpee Broad Jumps, 12 KB Swings (32/24 kg)

---

#### Example 3: Upper/Lower Balanced AMRAP (Intermediate-Advanced)

**Goal:** Balanced muscular endurance; push/pull/squat/hinge
**Duration:** 15 min AMRAP

```
15-min AMRAP:
  12/10-cal Row
  10 Push-Ups
  8 Goblet Squats (24/16 kg)
  6 Pull-Ups (or Ring Rows)
```

**Design Reasoning:**
- Triplet + monostructural opener. Row taxes legs/back → push-ups shift to upper push → squats return to legs → pull-ups hit upper pull.
- No grip stacking: row → push-ups (no grip) → squats (front rack, light grip) → pull-ups (grip).
- Estimated round time: ~1:45 → target 8–9 rounds.

**Scaling:**
- Beginner: 8/6-cal Row, 8 Knee Push-Ups, 8 Air Squats, 6 Ring Rows
- Advanced: 15/12-cal Row, 12 Push-Ups, 10 Goblet Squats (32/24 kg), 8 Pull-Ups

## 1.3 For Time / Task Priority

### When to Use For Time Format

"For Time" workouts set a fixed amount of work and challenge the athlete to complete it as fast as possible. Use when:

- **Race simulation** — Hyrox itself is a "for time" event. This format trains the competitive mindset.
- **Testing maximal sustainable pace** — athletes must decide how hard to push, with real consequences for going too hard.
- **Benchmarking** — completion time is a precise, repeatable metric.
- **Mental resilience** — the work is defined; you can't hide from it.

### Estimating Appropriate Total Volume

**Target completion times by training context:**

| Purpose | Target Completion Time | Volume Implication |
|---|---|---|
| Speed/power test | 3–7 min | Low total volume, high intensity |
| Conditioning test | 8–15 min | Moderate volume, threshold intensity |
| Endurance simulation | 15–25 min | High volume, sustainable pace |
| Full race simulation | 25–40 min | Very high volume; advanced only |

**Volume estimation formula:**
1. List all movements and reps.
2. Estimate time per rep × reps for each.
3. Sum all movement times.
4. Add 10–15% for transitions and rest.
5. Confirm total falls within target window.

### Time Cap Setting

| Athlete Level | Time Cap as % of Expected Completion | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Beginner | 150–200% of "intended" time | Safety net; prevents excessive grinding |
| Intermediate | 120–130% | Allows completion with moderate pacing errors |
| Advanced | 100–110% | Tight cap; demands aggressive pacing |

Example: If a workout is designed to take ~15 min for an intermediate athlete, set the time cap at 18–20 min.

### Movement Ordering Principles

| Principle | Reasoning |
|---|---|
| **Technical/complex movements first** | Athletes are freshest and safest. (NSCA, Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning, 4th Ed.) |
| **High-skill before high-fatigue** | e.g., Lunges before burpees — not the reverse |
| **Alternate movement patterns** | Don't stack deadlifts → rows → KB swings (all hip hinge/back) |
| **Save monostructural for transitions** | Running or rowing between strength movements allows partial recovery |
| **End with a "sprint finish"** | Place a simple, high-output movement last (e.g., burpees, row cals) to allow athletes to empty the tank |

### Chipper vs. Repeated Rounds

| Format | When to Use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Chipper (single pass)** | High variety, race simulation, mental challenge of ticking off stations | 1 km Row, 50 Wall Balls, 400m Run, 40 KB Swings, 200m Run, 30 Burpees |
| **Repeated rounds** | When consistency and pacing are the focus; allows round-to-round comparison | 5 Rounds: 400m Run, 15 Wall Balls, 10 Burpees |

### Progression Methods

- **Increase total volume:** add reps or rounds
- **Increase load:** heavier implements
- **Tighten time cap:** same work, less time allowed
- **Add a movement:** e.g., 3-movement workout → 4-movement
- **Increase distances:** 200m run → 400m run

### 3 Example For Time Workouts

#### Example 1: Hyrox Half-Race Chipper (Advanced)

**Goal:** Race simulation for second half of Hyrox
**Time Cap:** 25 min

```
For Time:
  1,000m Row
  50 Wall Balls (20/14 lb)
  400m Run
  200m Farmer Carry (2x32/24 kg)
  400m Run
  100m Sandbag Lunges (20/15 kg)
  400m Run
  75 Burpee Broad Jumps
```

**Design Reasoning:**
- Chipper format mimics Hyrox's one-pass-through structure.
- Movements are ordered to distribute fatigue: row (full body) → wall balls (legs/shoulders) → carry (grip/core) → lunges (legs/back) → burpees (full body finisher).
- Runs between stations replicate the Hyrox structure.
- Burpees last — simple, grind-it-out movement when exhausted.

**Scaling:**
- Beginner: Cut all volumes by 50%. Reduce loads by 30–40%. Time cap 35 min.
- Intermediate: Cut volumes by 25%. Time cap 28 min.

---

#### Example 2: Repeated Round Pacer (Intermediate)

**Goal:** Pacing practice; consistent round times
**Time Cap:** 18 min

```
5 Rounds For Time:
  200m Run
  15 KB Swings (24/16 kg)
  10 Push-Ups
  5 Burpees
```

**Design Reasoning:**
- 5 identical rounds → athletes can (and should) target consistent splits.
- Estimated round time: ~2:30 → total ~12:30–15:00 for intermediate.
- Movement ordering: run (systemic), swings (posterior chain), push-ups (upper push, no grip), burpees (finisher).
- No grip stacking: KB swings → push-ups (grip-free) → burpees (grip-free).

**Scaling:**
- Beginner: 3 Rounds, 100m Run, 10 KB Swings (16/12 kg), 8 Knee Push-Ups, 3 Burpees. Time cap 15 min.
- Advanced: 7 Rounds, 200m Run, 15 KB Swings (32/24 kg), 15 Push-Ups, 8 Burpees. Time cap 20 min.

---

#### Example 3: Sprint For Time (All Levels)

**Goal:** Glycolytic capacity; fast and punishing
**Time Cap:** 8 min

```
For Time:
  30/24-cal SkiErg
  30 Wall Balls (20/14 lb)
  30 Burpees
```

**Design Reasoning:**
- 3 movements × 30 reps = "30-30-30" — simple, memorable.
- Expected completion: 5–7 min for intermediate. Fast enough to be glycolytic but with volume demanding pacing.
- SkiErg → Wall Balls → Burpees: pulling → pushing/squatting → full body. No movement pattern overlap.
- Descending skill requirement (SkiErg most technical → burpees least).

**Scaling:**
- Beginner: 20/16-cal SkiErg, 20 Wall Balls (14/10 lb), 20 Burpees (step-back). Time cap 12 min.
- Advanced: 40/32-cal SkiErg, 40 Wall Balls (20/14 lb), 40 Burpees. Time cap 8 min.

## 1.4 Intervals (Work:Rest)

### When to Use Structured Intervals

Intervals are the **most precise tool** for targeting specific energy systems (Buchheit & Laursen, *Science and Application of High-Intensity Interval Training*, 2022). Use when:

- You need to **isolate a specific energy system** (phosphagen, glycolytic, oxidative).
- You want **controlled intensity** — the rest period dictates recovery and subsequent effort quality.
- The athlete needs **repeatability at high intensity** — can't achieve this in an AMRAP where pacing self-selects.
- Specific **race-pace training** — e.g., "Hyrox station pace" intervals.

### Work:Rest Ratios by Energy System

| Energy System | Work Duration | Work:Rest Ratio | Intensity | Sets | Total Session Duration | Application |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Phosphagen (Alactic)** | 5–15 sec | 1:3 to 1:5 | 95–100% | 6–10 | 10–15 min | Sprint starts, explosive burpee broad jumps, maximal sled push starts |
| **Glycolytic (Lactic)** | 30–90 sec | 1:1 to 1:2 | 85–95% | 4–8 | 15–25 min | Hyrox station-pace efforts, threshold tolerance |
| **Oxidative (Aerobic Power)** | 2–5 min | 1:0.5 to 1:1 | 75–85% | 3–6 | 20–40 min | VO2max development, sustained Hyrox pacing |
| **Oxidative (Aerobic Endurance)** | 5–10 min | 1:0.25 to 1:0.5 | 65–75% | 2–4 | 30–50 min | Base building, long race prep |

### Movement Selection by Energy System

| System | Ideal Movement Characteristics | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Phosphagen** | Simple, explosive, max-effort | Bike sprint, sled push sprint, burpee broad jump for distance |
| **Glycolytic** | Moderate complexity, high power output sustainable for 30–90 sec | Row intervals, SkiErg intervals, wall balls, KB swings |
| **Oxidative** | Low-moderate complexity, repeatable | Running, rowing, SkiErg, mixed-modal circuits |

### Progression Methods

1. **Increase work duration** (e.g., 30 sec → 45 sec → 60 sec at same intensity)
2. **Decrease rest** (e.g., 1:2 → 1:1.5 → 1:1)
3. **Add sets** (e.g., 4 sets → 5 → 6)
4. **Increase intensity/load** (faster pace, heavier sled)
5. **Progress from single-modal to mixed-modal** (row only → row + wall balls)

### 3 Example Interval Sessions

#### Example 1: Glycolytic Station Intervals (Intermediate)

**Goal:** Hyrox station-pace tolerance; lactate buffering
**Energy System:** Glycolytic

```
6 Rounds:
  60 sec: Max-cal SkiErg
  60 sec: Rest
  
  Record calories each round. Target: consistent cals (±2) across all 6 rounds.
```

**Design Reasoning:**
- 1:1 work:rest → glycolytic system primary driver.
- 60-sec work bouts match Hyrox SkiErg station duration for faster athletes.
- Consistency target teaches pacing — if round 1 is 18 cal and round 6 is 11 cal, the athlete went out too hard.

**Scaling:**
- Beginner: 4 rounds, 45 sec work, 75 sec rest (1:1.7)
- Advanced: 8 rounds, 60 sec work, 45 sec rest (1:0.75)

---

#### Example 2: Oxidative Power Intervals (Advanced)

**Goal:** VO2max development; race-pace sustained efforts
**Energy System:** Aerobic Power

```
5 Rounds:
  3:00 Work: 200m Run + 15 Wall Balls (20/14 lb) + Max-cal Row in remaining time
  2:00 Rest
  
  Score = total Row calories across all 5 rounds.
```

**Design Reasoning:**
- 3-min work intervals at 1:0.67 rest → heavy oxidative demand with meaningful anaerobic contribution.
- Mixed-modal within each interval simulates Hyrox transitions.
- Row cals as the "score" incentivize athletes to move quickly through run and wall balls.
- 5 rounds × 5 min = 25 min total → appropriate session length.

**Scaling:**
- Beginner: 3 rounds, 3:00 work (100m run, 10 wall balls, row), 3:00 rest
- Intermediate: 4 rounds, 3:00 work, 2:00 rest

---

#### Example 3: Phosphagen Power Sprints (All Levels)

**Goal:** Explosive power; sled push start speed
**Energy System:** Phosphagen/Alactic

```
8 Rounds:
  10 sec: All-Out Assault Bike Sprint
  50 sec: Complete Rest (walk around, shake out)
  
  Record peak watts each round.
```

**Design Reasoning:**
- 10-sec work, 50-sec rest = 1:5 ratio → full phosphagen recovery between sets.
- Assault bike is safe for maximal sprints (no eccentric loading, no technique breakdown).
- Peak watts as metric → if watts drop >15% from round 1, athlete is exceeding phosphagen capacity.
- 8 rounds in 8 min → efficient session.

**Scaling:**
- Beginner: 6 rounds, 8 sec work, 52 sec rest
- Advanced: 10 rounds, 12 sec work, 48 sec rest

---

## 1.5 Tabata

### Classic Tabata Format

The original Tabata protocol (Tabata et al., 1996): **20 sec work / 10 sec rest × 8 rounds = 4 minutes total**. Originally performed on a cycle ergometer at 170% VO2max.

**When it's appropriate:**
- Short, brutal conditioning finishers.
- When time is extremely limited (4–8 min available).
- For movements that can be performed at maximal effort safely with rapid transitions.
- NOT appropriate for heavy or technically complex movements (the 10-sec rest is too short for setup).

### Modified Tabata Formats

| Format | Work:Rest | Rounds | Total Time | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Classic** | 20:10 | 8 | 4:00 | Maximum intensity, single simple movement |
| **Extended** | 30:15 | 8 | 6:00 | Slightly more work capacity focused; allows more complex movements |
| **Heavy** | 40:20 | 6–8 | 6:00–8:00 | Strength-endurance; heavier loads sustainable for 40 sec |
| **Double Tabata** | 20:10 | 16 (2 movements) | 8:00 | 8 rounds movement A, then 8 rounds movement B |

### Movement Selection for Tabata

| ✅ Good for Tabata | ❌ Bad for Tabata |
|---|---|
| Air squats, burpees, mountain climbers | Barbell snatches (too technical under fatigue) |
| KB swings, ball slams, battle ropes | Heavy deadlifts (injury risk with 10-sec rest) |
| Assault bike, rower sprints | Handstand push-ups (setup time) |
| Push-ups, sit-ups, box jumps | Complex Olympic lifts |
| Wall balls (if target is close) | Movements requiring equipment changes |

### 2 Example Tabata Sessions

#### Example 1: Classic Double Tabata Finisher (All Levels)

**Goal:** Metabolic conditioning finisher; Hyrox movement pattern training

```
Tabata 1 (4:00): Wall Balls (20/14 lb)
  20 sec max reps / 10 sec rest × 8 rounds
  
Rest 1:00

Tabata 2 (4:00): Burpees
  20 sec max reps / 10 sec rest × 8 rounds

Total time: 9:00
Score: Total reps (wall balls + burpees separately)
```

**Design Reasoning:**
- Two Hyrox-specific movements in pure Tabata format.
- Wall balls first (more technical, requires target) while fresher.
- Burpees second (simpler, can grind through fatigue).
- Score allows tracking: typical intermediate scores — wall balls: 70–90 total reps, burpees: 50–65 total reps.

**Scaling:**
- Beginner: 14/10 lb wall ball, step-back burpees; record reps and aim to improve
- Advanced: 20/14 lb wall ball, burpee broad jumps

#### Example 2: Modified Heavy Tabata (Intermediate-Advanced)

**Goal:** Strength-endurance conditioning; grip and core

```
40 sec work / 20 sec rest × 6 rounds per movement, rotating:

Round 1: KB Swings (24/16 kg)
Round 2: Farmer Hold in Place (2x32/24 kg) — just hold, don't walk
Round 3: KB Swings
Round 4: Farmer Hold
Round 5: KB Swings
Round 6: Farmer Hold

Total time: 6:00
```

**Design Reasoning:**
- 40:20 allows heavier loads than classic 20:10.
- Alternating dynamic (swings) with isometric (farmer hold) trains grip endurance from two angles.
- Direct Hyrox transfer: KB swing power + farmer carry grip stamina.
- 6 minutes total = effective finisher or part of a larger session.

**Scaling:**
- Beginner: 30:15 format, lighter KBs (16/12 kg, 24/16 kg holds)
- Advanced: 40:20, heavier KBs (32/24 kg swings, 2x40/32 kg holds)

# 2. MOVEMENT PAIRING PRINCIPLES

---

## 2.1 Push/Pull Pairing

**Concept:** Pair a pushing movement with a pulling movement to allow agonist/antagonist recovery.

| Push | Pull | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Push-ups | Ring Rows | Bodyweight, accessible |
| DB Bench Press | DB Bent-Over Row | Same equipment |
| DB Push Press | Pull-ups | Vertical push + vertical pull |
| Wall Balls (push component) | SkiErg (pull component) | Hyrox-specific |

**When to use:** EMOMs (alternating minutes), supersets in strength work, moderate-intensity conditioning.
**When to avoid:** In high-fatigue scenarios where grip is a limiter — push-ups don't need grip, but rows and pull-ups do, so stacking multiple pulling movements is the real risk.

## 2.2 Upper/Lower Alternating

**Concept:** Alternate upper-body and lower-body dominant movements so that local muscular fatigue dissipates while systemic cardiovascular demand remains high.

| Upper | Lower | Combined Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Push-ups | Goblet Squats | Chest/triceps rest during squats; quads rest during push-ups |
| Pull-ups | Lunges | Lats/biceps rest during lunges |
| DB Push Press | KB Deadlifts | Shoulders rest during deadlifts |
| SkiErg | Wall Sits | Full-body pull recovery during isometric hold |

**Benefit for Hyrox:** Hyrox naturally alternates patterns (running = lower → SkiErg = upper → running → sled push = lower). Training in this pattern builds sport-specific work capacity.

## 2.3 Hyrox Station Simulation Pairing

| Hyrox Station | Primary Gym Simulator | Secondary Alternatives | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1 km SkiErg** | SkiErg | Battle ropes (30 sec intervals), banded lat pull-downs for reps, heavy ball slams | Nothing perfectly replaces SkiErg; battle ropes are closest for upper-body pulling endurance |
| **50m Sled Push** | Heavy prowler/sled push | Heavy wall pushes (iso), weighted bear crawls, leg press (high volume), heavy band-resisted marching | Focus on heavy horizontal pushing with leg drive |
| **50m Sled Pull** | Hand-over-hand rope sled pull | Seated cable row (heavy, high rep), heavy band pulls, rope climbs (grip + pull) | Grip + upper back endurance is key stimulus |
| **80m Burpee Broad Jump** | Burpee broad jumps | Burpee + box jump, burpee + tuck jump, lateral burpees (limited space) | Nothing replaces the BBJ fully; simulate distance by counting reps |
| **1 km Row** | Rowing ergometer | Fan bike/Assault bike, ring rows + air squats combined | Bike captures the leg drive + cardio; ring rows add the pull |
| **200m Farmer Carry** | Farmer carry (heavy KBs/DBs) | Trap bar carry, heavy DB hold + walk, loaded backpack walks | Load and distance are the key variables |
| **100m Sandbag Lunges** | Sandbag lunge (front-loaded) | Goblet lunges, front rack barbell lunges, D-ball bear hug lunges, heavy backpack lunges | Front-loading is critical — back-loaded lunges miss the anterior core demand |
| **75 Wall Balls** | Wall balls (to regulation height) | Thrusters (DB or BB), front squat + push press, med ball cleans + press | Full squat depth + overhead push; thrusters are the closest substitute |

## 2.4 Movement Complexity Sequencing

### Technical Movements: Place First

Movements requiring coordination, timing, or high skill should be performed while the athlete is freshest:
- Burpee broad jumps (timing of jump)
- SkiErg (technique-dependent efficiency)
- Lunges under load (balance)
- Wall balls (depth, accuracy, rhythm)

### Fatigue Stacking Rules

| ❌ Avoid This Stack | Why | ✅ Better Alternative |
|---|---|---|
| Deadlifts → Bent-Over Rows | Lower back fatigue compounds → injury risk | Deadlifts → Push-ups → Rows |
| Pull-ups → KB Swings → Farmer Carry | Grip fatigue × 3 consecutive movements | Pull-ups → Squats → Farmer Carry |
| Rowing → Deadlifts → KB Swings | Posterior chain + lower back × 3 | Rowing → Wall Balls → KB Swings |
| Heavy Lunges → Running → Sled Push | Quad fatigue × 3 → blown legs | Lunges → SkiErg → Sled Push (upper/lower alternation) |
| Wall Balls → Thrusters → Push Press | Shoulder fatigue × 3 | Wall Balls → Row → Push Press |

**Golden Rule:** Never stack more than 2 movements with the same primary fatigue site. Insert a contrasting movement in between.

## 3.1 SkiErg Alternatives

| Rank | Substitute | Stimulus Captured | What's Lost | % Match |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Battle Ropes (30 sec intervals)** | Upper body muscular endurance, arm/shoulder fatigue, cardiovascular demand | No lat engagement (more anterior deltoid); no standing hip extension pull pattern; can't replicate 1 km continuous | 65% |
| 2 | **Heavy Ball Slams** | Lat engagement, core flexion, full-body power | No sustained cardio duration; impact stress; can't maintain for 3–4 min straight | 55% |

# 4. SCALING & MODIFICATION FRAMEWORK

---

## 4.1 Scaling by Fitness Level

### Beginner Modifications by Workout Format

| Format | Modification | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| **EMOM** | Extend to E2MOM (every 2 min); reduce reps by 40–50%; simplify movements | More rest ensures quality; prevents technique breakdown |
| **AMRAP** | Reduce time domain by 30%; reduce reps per round by 30–40%; use bodyweight alternatives | Shorter AMRAPs prevent excessive fatigue accumulation |
| **For Time** | Increase time cap by 50–100%; reduce total volume by 40–50%; remove most complex movement | Generous time cap prevents panic; less volume = manageable |
| **Intervals** | Reduce sets by 30–40%; increase rest ratio by 50%; lower intensity targets | More recovery between efforts; quality over quantity |
| **Tabata** | Use :20 work / :20 rest (instead of :10 rest); reduce to 6 rounds; use simple movements only | Extra rest prevents complete breakdown; fewer rounds |

### Complexity Reduction Without Losing Intent

| Prescribed Movement | Beginner Sub | Training Intent Preserved |
|---|---|---|
| Burpee Broad Jump | Step-back Burpee | Ground-to-standing + cardiovascular demand ✓ |
| Pull-Up | Ring Row (feet elevated) | Horizontal pull strength ✓ |
| BB Thruster | Goblet Squat + Push Press (separate) | Squat + press pattern ✓ |
| Sandbag Lunge | Goblet Reverse Lunge (in place) | Front-loaded single-leg work ✓; eliminates walking balance demand |
| Sled Push (heavy) | Wall push (isometric, timed) | Leg drive pattern ✓; eliminates load management |
| SkiErg (1 km) | 3 × 1:00 Battle Ropes w/ 30 sec rest | Upper body pull endurance ✓; breaks up duration |

### Rep Scheme Scaling Table

| Level | % of Prescribed Reps | % of Prescribed Load | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Beginner** | 50–60% | 50–60% | Focus on movement quality; complete all reps cleanly |
| **Intermediate** | 75–90% | 75–90% | Should be challenging but sustainable |
| **Advanced (Rx)** | 100% | 100% | As prescribed |
| **Elite / Competition** | 110–120% | 100–110% | Overreach phase only; higher volume or load |

## 4.2 Scaling by Available Time

### 45-min Workout → 30 min

| Component | Keep/Cut | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Warm-up (10 min) | **Keep but reduce to 5–7 min** | Essential for injury prevention — cut general cardio, keep dynamic stretching and movement prep |
| Strength/skill (10 min) | **Cut or combine with conditioning** | If the workout has a separate strength block, make it part of the conditioning (e.g., add deadlifts into the AMRAP) |
| Conditioning (20 min) | **Reduce to 15 min** | Reduce rounds, distance, or time domain — NOT intensity |
| Cool-down (5 min) | **Keep 2–3 min** | Light walk/stretch |

### 30-min Workout → 20 min

| Strategy | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Cut warm-up to 3–4 min** | Movement-specific only: 10 reps of each workout movement at light load |
| **Combine all work into one conditioning block** | No separate strength work; make the conditioning piece include loaded movements |
| **Reduce time domain by 30%** | 20-min AMRAP → 14-min; 5 rounds → 3 rounds |
| **Cut cool-down** | Acknowledge the trade-off; recommend athlete does their own later |

### Rules for Preserving Intent When Compressing

1. **Never cut intensity** — if the workout is meant to be hard, keep it hard; just do less of it.
2. **Maintain the movement pattern balance** — if the original has push/pull/squat/hinge, the shortened version should too.
3. **Prioritize sport-specific movements** — in a Hyrox program, keep wall balls and burpees over bicep curls.
4. **Keep the "hardest" element** — if the workout's purpose is sled push tolerance, don't remove the sled push.
5. **Reduce volume before reducing variety** — 8 reps of 4 movements > 15 reps of 2 movements.

## 4.3 Scaling for Injuries and Limitations

### Upper Body Limitations

| Limitation | Affected Movements | Modifications |
|---|---|---|
| **Shoulder injury** | Push-ups, push press, wall balls, SkiErg, overhead movements | Replace with: incline push-ups (pain-free angle), landmine press, front squat instead of wall ball, bike instead of SkiErg |
| **Elbow/wrist injury** | Push-ups, front rack, farmer carry grip | Replace with: DB floor press (neutral grip), zercher squats, forearm-strap farmer carries, bike |
| **General upper body** | All pressing and pulling | Focus programming on legs + monostructural cardio: running, assault bike (legs only), squats, lunges, sled push (arms-free if possible), step-ups |

### Lower Body Limitations

| Limitation | Affected Movements | Modifications |
|---|---|---|
| **Knee injury** | Squats, lunges, running, box jumps | Replace with: bike (limited ROM if needed), wall balls with shallow squat, step-ups to low box, sled pull (upper body focus), swimming |
| **Ankle injury** | Running, box jumps, lunges, squats | Replace with: bike, rowing, SkiErg, seated movements, upper body focus. Squats to a box (controlled depth) |
| **Hip injury** | Squats, deadlifts, lunges, running | Replace with: bike (if hip tolerates), SkiErg, upper body circuits, isometric bridges (if pain-free) |
| **General lower body** | All squat/lunge/run/jump | Focus on upper body + monostructural: SkiErg, rowing, battle ropes, push-ups, pull-ups, seated movements |

### Grip Limitations

| Affected Hyrox Movements | Modifications |
|---|---|
| **Farmer Carry** | Forearm strap carries; lighter weight for longer distance; rack carry (rests on forearms) |
| **Sled Pull** | Use towel/strap wraps; reduce load by 30–40%; cable machine seated rows (padded handles) |
| **Rowing Erg** | Wrist straps on handle; reduce distance, increase bike substitution |
| **KB Swings / Deadlifts** | Use straps; reduce reps, increase load per rep (fewer total grip demands) |
| **General approach** | Limit grip-intensive movements to 1 per workout; supplement with grip rehab (rice bucket, band extensions) |

### Cardio Limitations (Asthma, Returning from Illness, Deconditioning)

| Modification Principle | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Reduce intensity before volume** | Keep workout structure but target RPE 5–6 instead of 7–8 |
| **Extend rest periods by 50–100%** | EMOM → E2MOM; 1:1 intervals → 1:2

## Original Prompt

```
You are a programming design expert building the workout generation engine for an AI-powered Hyrox coach. The coach needs to CREATE new workouts on the fly — not just retrieve pre-written ones. To do this, it needs the RULES and PRINCIPLES for building effective workouts.

## 1. Workout Format Construction Rules

### EMOM (Every Minute on the Minute)
- When to use EMOM format (what training goals does it serve?)
- Time domain guidelines: 8-min EMOM vs 16-min vs 24-min — when to use each
- Work:rest ratio: how much work should fit in each minute (30-40 sec work?)
- Movement count: 1 movement per minute vs 2-3 movement couplets
- Movement pairing rules: what pairs well in an EMOM? (push+pull? upper+lower?)
- Rep scheme design: how to set reps so work fits the minute
- Progression: how to make an EMOM harder over weeks (add reps? add load? reduce rest?)
- 3 example EMOMs with full prescriptions and the reasoning behind each design choice

### AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible)
- When to use AMRAP format
- Time domain guidelines: 5-min AMRAP vs 12-min vs 20-min — purposes of each
- Movement count: 2-movement couplet vs 3-movement triplet vs 4+ chipper-style
- Rep scheme design: how to balance movements so no single one is the bottleneck
- Scoring: how to set target scores by fitness level
- Progression: how to make an AMRAP harder
- 3 example AMRAPs with full prescriptions and design reasoning

### For Time / Task Priority
- When to use For Time format
- How to estimate appropriate total volume (not too short, not too long)
- Time cap setting: how to set time caps by fitness level
- Movement ordering: which movements go first vs last and why
- "Chipper" style: one-pass-through vs repeated rounds — when to use each
- Progression methods
- 3 example For Time workouts with full prescriptions

### Intervals (Work:Rest)
- When to use structured interval format
- Work:rest ratios by energy system target:
  - Phosphagen/alactic: 10-15 sec work, 1:3-1:5 rest ratio
  - Glycolytic: 30-90 sec work, 1:1-1:2 rest
  - Oxidative: 2-5 min work, 1:0.5-1:1 rest
- Number of intervals: how many sets for each system
- Movement selection by energy system
- Progression: increase work, decrease rest, add sets
- 3 example interval sessions with full prescriptions

### Tabata
- Classic 20:10 x 8 format and when it's appropriate
- Modified Tabata formats (:30/:15, :40/:20) and their uses
- Movement selection: what works in Tabata, what doesn't
- 2 example Tabata sessions with full prescriptions

## 2. Movement Pairing Principles

Create a comprehensive reference for how to combine movements in workouts:

### Push/Pull Pairing
- Upper body push + upper body pull (e.g., push-ups + pull-ups)
- When to use this vs avoid it

### Upper/Lower Alternating
- Upper body movement + lower body movement
- Benefit: local muscular recovery while maintaining systemic output

### Hyrox Station Simulation Pairing
- Which gym movements simulate which Hyrox stations
- Table format: Station | Primary Simulator | Secondary Alternatives
- Example: SkiErg → actual SkiErg, OR battle ropes, OR banded pull-downs

### Movement Complexity Sequencing
- When to put technical movements first (fresh) vs last (fatigued)
- How to sequence movements to avoid grip fatigue stacking
- How to avoid lower back fatigue stacking (e.g., deadlifts before rows = bad pairing)

### Create a Movement Selection Matrix
Table format: Movement | Primary Muscles | Hyrox Station Transfer | Complexity Level | Fatigue Type (local vs systemic) | Good Pairs With

Include at least 30 common training movements in this matrix.

## 3. Equipment Substitution Guide

For athletes who don't have access to Hyrox-specific equipment:

### SkiErg Alternatives
- No SkiErg: what machines or movements replicate the stimulus?
- Ranked alternatives with explanation of what each captures and misses

### Rowing Alternatives
- No rower: alternatives that replicate the full-body pull + leg drive

### Sled Push Alternatives
- No sled: what replicates heavy horizontal pushing under load?
- Consider: heavy prowler, wall pushes, loaded bear crawls, etc.

### Sled Pull Alternatives
- No sled: what replicates heavy hand-over-hand pulling?
- Consider: heavy rope pulls, seated cable rows, band-resisted pulls

### Burpee Broad Jump Alternatives
- Training at home with limited space: what captures the same stimulus?

### Farmers Carry Alternatives
- No heavy kettlebells: what works? Dumbbells, trap bar, loaded backpack?

### Sandbag Lunge Alternatives
- No sandbag: front-loaded alternatives (goblet walks, barbell lunges, etc.)

### Wall Ball Alternatives
- No wall ball target: thrusters? Front squats + push press? What captures the same metabolic demand?

For EACH substitution, explain: what % of the original stimulus it captures, and what's lost.

## 4. Scaling & Modification Framework

### Scaling by Fitness Level
- Beginner modifications for each workout format
- How to reduce complexity without losing training intent
- Rep scheme scaling: what % of prescribed reps for beginners?

### Scaling by Available Time
- How to cut a 45-min workout to 30 min: what to prioritize
- How to cut to 20 min: minimum effective dose
- Rules for preserving workout intent when compressing

### Scaling for Injuries/Limitations
- Upper body limitations: how to modify upper-body-heavy workouts
- Lower body limitations: what to substitute for squats, lunges, running
- Grip limitations: alternatives for farmers carry, sled pull, rowing
- Cardio limitations (asthma, returning from illness): intensity modifications

IMPORTANT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Length: At minimum 5,000 words. This is the AI coach's workout generation engine.
- Format: Use markdown tables extensively, especially for the movement selection matrix and equipment substitution guide.
- Every example workout must be FULLY PRESCRIBED: movements, reps, sets, rest, time caps, scaling options.
- The movement selection matrix (30+ movements) is the MOST IMPORTANT deliverable — make it comprehensive.
- Cite sources: programming textbooks (NSCA, ACSM), CrossFit programming methodology, coaches.
