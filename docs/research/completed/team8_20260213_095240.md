## 1. Daily Macronutrient Framework

### 1.1 Estimating Caloric Needs

For an athlete training 10–12 hours/week across running, strength, and HIIT, total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) typically falls in the range of **40–50 kcal/kg/day** (Thomas et al., 2016 — AND/DoC/ACSM Joint Position Statement). For our reference 82 kg male athlete:

| Day Type | Multiplier | Estimated TDEE |
|---|---|---|
| Heavy Training Day (2+ hrs) | 45–50 kcal/kg | **3,700–4,100 kcal** |
| Moderate Training Day (60–90 min) | 40–45 kcal/kg | **3,280–3,700 kcal** |
| Rest/Recovery Day | 30–35 kcal/kg | **2,460–2,870 kcal** |

**Practical estimation method:**
1. Calculate BMR using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation: (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) − (5 × age) − 5 for males.
2. Multiply by an activity factor of 1.6–1.9 depending on training volume that day.
3. Add the thermic effect of exercise using MET values for the specific session.

**Body Recomposition Approach:**
If the goal is to optimise body composition while maintaining performance, a **small caloric deficit of 200–300 kcal/day on rest days** while eating at maintenance or a slight surplus on training days is the most evidence-supported approach (Helms et al., 2014, JISSN). Aggressive deficits (>500 kcal/day) impair recovery, increase injury risk, and blunt training adaptations. The key is to prioritise protein, train hard, and let body composition improve gradually over the 16-week block. A rate of fat loss exceeding ~0.5 kg/week risks lean mass loss (Garthe et al., 2011).

### 1.2 Protein

**Daily Intake Target:** The ISSN Position Stand on Protein and Exercise (Jäger et al., 2017) recommends **1.4–2.0 g/kg/day** for exercising individuals. For concurrent endurance + strength training athletes, the evidence supports the **upper end of this range: 1.8–2.2 g/kg/day**. This is because:

- Endurance exercise increases amino acid oxidation during prolonged sessions.
- Strength training requires substrate for muscle protein synthesis (MPS).
- The concurrent training interference effect can be partially mitigated by adequate protein provision (Shamim et al., cited in PMC11688070; Baar, 2014 — GSSI SSE #136).

**For our 82 kg athlete:** **148–180 g protein/day** (targeting ~2.0 g/kg = 164 g/day).

**Protein Distribution:**

| Parameter | Recommendation | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Meals per day | 4–5 protein feedings | ISSN, 2017 |
| Protein per meal/snack | 0.25–0.4 g/kg (20–40 g) | Morton et al., 2018 meta-analysis |
| Meal spacing | Every 3–4 hours | ISSN, 2017 |
| Leucine per meal | 2.5–3.0 g (threshold for maximal MPS) | ISSN, 2017 |

**Timing Considerations:**
- The "anabolic window" is **not** a narrow 30-minute period. The post-exercise elevation in MPS lasts **at least 24 hours**, though it diminishes progressively (Jäger et al., 2017). Consuming 20–40 g of high-quality protein **within 0–2 hours post-exercise** is beneficial but not urgent if a meal is consumed within a few hours.
- **Pre-sleep protein:** Research by Snijders et al. (2015) and Res et al. (2012) demonstrated that ~30–40 g of casein before sleep increases overnight MPS and may augment muscle mass/strength gains during prolonged training. However, this benefit appears to be primarily about **increasing total daily protein intake** rather than a unique property of pre-sleep timing per se (Jäger et al., 2017). If total daily protein is already adequate across 4–5 meals, adding pre-sleep casein is a marginal optimisation, not a requirement.

**Plant-Based Athlete Considerations:**
- Plant proteins are generally lower in leucine and may have lower digestibility (DIAAS scores).
- Recommendation: Increase total daily protein to **2.0–2.4 g/kg/day** to compensate, combine complementary protein sources (e.g., rice + pea), and consider adding leucine (2.5 g) to plant-based meals to achieve the leucine threshold. Soy protein is the highest-quality single plant source but lacks methionine.

### 1.3 Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are the **primary fuel** for the high-intensity work that defines Hyrox (running intervals, sled pushes, rowing, wall balls). The ACSM/AND/DoC Joint Position Statement (Thomas et al., 2016) and Burke et al. provide the following framework:

| Training Day Type | Carb Target (g/kg/day) | For 82 kg athlete |
|---|---|---|
| Light/Recovery day | 3–5 g/kg | 246–410 g |
| Moderate training (60 min) | 5–7 g/kg | 410–574 g |
| High-volume day (90–120 min) | 6–8 g/kg | 492–656 g |
| Race-week carb loading | 8–12 g/kg | 656–984 g |

**Carb Periodization for Hyrox:**

- **High-carb days** should align with long runs (>60 min), heavy strength sessions, and HIIT days. These sessions are glycogen-dependent.
- **Moderate-carb days** suit easier recovery runs and lighter gym sessions.
- **Low-carb training** ("train low") is a strategy sometimes used by endurance athletes to enhance fat oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis. However, for Hyrox athletes, this is generally **inappropriate** because: (1) Hyrox is primarily a glycolytic event (60–90 min at high intensity); (2) training in a glycogen-depleted state can activate AMPK, which may interfere with mTOR signalling and blunt strength adaptations (Baar, 2014 — GSSI); (3) it impairs session quality. If used at all, restrict it to one easy, low-intensity aerobic session per week during base-building, and never before or during strength or HIIT sessions.

**Pre-Workout Carbohydrate:**

| Timing | Amount | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| 3–4 hours before | 1–4 g/kg (82–328 g) | Large mixed meal: oats, toast, fruit, eggs |
| 1–2 hours before | 1–2 g/kg (82–164 g) | Smaller meal: banana + toast + honey |
| 30–60 min before | 0.5–1 g/kg (40–82 g) | Banana, energy bar, white rice |

Source: Thomas et al., 2016; Naderi et al., 2023 (Nutrients review).

**AM vs PM sessions:** For AM sessions, consume a moderate pre-workout meal 60–90 minutes before (e.g., oats with banana, ~60–80 g carbs). For PM sessions, ensure adequate carb intake across breakfast and lunch to optimise glycogen stores.

**Intra-Workout Carbs:**
- Sessions **<60 minutes:** Not necessary. A carbohydrate mouth rinse can provide a small performance benefit via central nervous system signalling, but caloric intake is not physiologically required.
- Sessions **60–90 minutes:** 30–60 g/hr of carbohydrate is beneficial (Jeukendrup, 2014).
- Sessions **>90 minutes:** 60–90 g/hr using a glucose:fructose blend (2:1 ratio) to maximise absorption via dual intestinal transporters (Jeukendrup, 2014; Naderi et al., 2023).

**Post-Workout Carb Replenishment:**
- Consume **1.0–1.2 g/kg** of carbohydrate in the first 1–2 hours post-exercise when there is another session within 8 hours.
- High-GI carbs (white rice, potatoes, bread) are preferred for rapid glycogen resynthesis (Burke et al., 1993; Wong et al., 2009).
- When the next session is >24 hours away, total daily carb intake matters more than immediate post-workout timing (Namma-Motonaga et al., 2022).
- Co-ingesting protein with carbohydrate does not enhance glycogen synthesis beyond what equal-calorie carbohydrate alone provides, but it does support MPS (Margolis et al., 2021 meta-analysis).

### 1.4 Fats

| Parameter | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| **Minimum for hormonal health** | 0.5 g/kg/day (approximately 20% of total calories) |
| **Optimal range** | 1.0–1.5 g/kg/day (25–35% of total calories) |
| **For 82 kg athlete** | 82–123 g/day |

Going below 20% of total calories from fat chronically can impair testosterone production, menstrual function, and absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (Thomas et al., 2016).

**Timing around workouts:** Fat slows gastric emptying. Avoid high-fat meals **within 1–2 hours pre-workout** to prevent GI discomfort. Post-workout, fat does not impair glycogen resynthesis or MPS, so including moderate fat in post-workout meals is fine (e.g., eggs, avocado).

**Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** A combined EPA/DHA intake of **1–3 g/day** is supported for reducing exercise-induced inflammation, supporting cardiovascular health, and potentially improving muscle protein synthesis (Philpott et al., 2019 meta-analysis). Dietary sources include fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, sardines). If intake is inadequate, supplementation is warranted (see Section 3).

## 2. Hydration Protocol

### 2.1 Daily Hydration

**Baseline fluid intake:** A practical starting point is **30–40 ml per kg of body weight per day** as baseline hydration (excluding exercise losses). For an 82 kg athlete: **2.5–3.3 litres/day** of baseline fluid.

**Assessing hydration status:**

| Method | Target | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Urine colour | Pale straw/light yellow | First void of the day is most indicative |
| Body weight | ≤1% change AM-to-AM | Weigh upon waking after voiding |
| Thirst | Not thirsty upon waking | A simple but valid indicator in most athletes |
| Urine frequency | Every 2–4 hours during waking | ACSM guideline |

**Daily electrolyte targets for heavy-training athletes:**

| Electrolyte | Daily Target | Key Sources |
|---|---|---|
| Sodium | 2,000–4,000 mg | Salt in food, electrolyte drinks, broth |
| Potassium | 3,500–4,700 mg | Bananas, potatoes, leafy greens, dairy |
| Magnesium | 400–600 mg | Nuts, seeds, dark leafy greens, dark chocolate |

Source: AND/ACSM guidelines; Precision Hydration; GSSI recommendations.

**When to use electrolyte drinks vs plain water:**
- Sessions <60 min in moderate conditions: **plain water** is sufficient.
- Sessions >60 min, high-intensity sessions, or hot/humid conditions: use an **electrolyte drink** containing 300–800 mg sodium per litre.
- Heavy sweaters or salty sweaters (white salt residue on clothing): prioritise sodium-containing drinks during and after training.

---

### 2.2 Training Hydration

**Pre-Training:**
- Consume **5–7 ml/kg** of fluid 2–4 hours before exercise (410–575 ml for 82 kg athlete) (ACSM Position Stand, Sawka et al., 2007).
- Include **~500 mg sodium** with the pre-exercise fluid, especially before intense or hot-weather sessions (ACSM fact sheet). This can be as simple as salting breakfast foods.

**During Training:**

| Session Type | Fluid Intake Rate |
|---|---|
| Strength session (60 min, indoors) | 200–400 ml/hr (sipping between sets) |
| Moderate run (45–60 min) | 400–600 ml/hr |
| Long run / HIIT (60–90+ min) | 500–800 ml/hr (individualised to sweat rate) |

**General rule:** Replace 50–80% of sweat losses during exercise. Do **not** aim for 100% replacement during exercise — overhydration and hyponatremia are real risks.

**Post-Training Rehydration:**
- Consume **1.25–1.5 litres of fluid per kg of body weight lost** during the session (ACSM, 2007).
- Include sodium (electrolyte drink, salty foods) to improve fluid retention.
- Consume gradually over 2–4 hours post-exercise.

**Practical Sweat Rate Estimation:**

1. Weigh yourself nude before exercise (Body Mass PRE).
2. Exercise for a measured duration (e.g., 60 min).
3. Track all fluid consumed during exercise.
4. Weigh yourself nude after exercise (Body Mass POST).
5. **Sweat rate (L/hr)** = (Body Mass PRE − Body Mass POST + Fluid Intake − Urine Output) ÷ Exercise Duration in hours.

Typical sweat rates range from **0.5–2.0 L/hr** depending on intensity, fitness level, and environment (Baker, 2017 — GSSI SSE #161). Repeat this test in different conditions (summer vs winter, easy vs hard sessions).

### 2.3 Hydration Schedule: Sample Training Day

| Time | Action | Volume |
|---|---|---|
| 6:00 AM (wake) | Water upon rising | 500 ml |
| 6:00–7:00 AM | Sip water with breakfast (add pinch of salt) | 250–400 ml |
| 7:00 AM (pre-run) | Final sip 15 min before run | 150–200 ml |
| During run (75 min) | Water or electrolyte drink every 15–20 min | 400–600 ml total |
| 8:15 AM (post-run) | Rehydrate with electrolyte-containing fluid + breakfast | 500–750 ml over 1 hr |
| 10:00 AM–3:00 PM | Sip water steadily across meals/snacks | 750–1,000 ml |
| 3:30 PM (pre-gym) | Pre-session hydration check | 300–400 ml |
| During gym (60 min) | Water between sets | 300–500 ml |
| 5:00 PM (post-gym) | Rehydrate with fluid + post-workout shake | 500 ml |
| 5:00–9:30 PM | Steady sipping with dinner, tapering before bed | 500–750 ml |
| **Daily Total** | | **~4.0–5.0 L** |

## 3. Evidence-Based Supplements

### Tier 1 — Strong Evidence

| Supplement | What It Does | Dosage | Timing | Evidence | Hyrox Application |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Creatine Monohydrate** | Increases phosphocreatine stores → faster ATP regeneration during high-intensity efforts; supports lean mass gains | Loading: 20 g/day (4 × 5 g) for 5–7 days; Maintenance: 3–5 g/day (or 0.03 g/kg/day) | Daily with a meal (timing is flexible; consistency matters most) | **Strong** — ISSN Position Stand (Kreider et al., 2017); one of the most researched supplements in sports science with >500 peer-reviewed studies | Directly benefits sled push/pull, wall balls, burpee broad jumps, and repeat sprint capacity. Also supports muscle mass during concurrent training. Safe for long-term use. |
| **Caffeine** | Blocks adenosine receptors → reduces perceived exertion and pain; enhances endurance and focus | 3–6 mg/kg body weight (250–500 mg for 82 kg athlete) | 30–60 min before training/competition | **Strong** — ISSN Position Stand (Goldstein et al., 2010); AND/DoC/ACSM endorsed | Enhances both the running segments and station performance. Use strategically (not daily at high doses) to prevent habituation, though evidence on habituation's effect is mixed (Gonçalves et al., 2017). Reserve highest doses for key sessions and race day. |
| **Vitamin D** | Maintains bone health, immune function, muscle function; deficiency impairs performance and recovery | 1,000–4,000 IU/day depending on blood levels; target serum 25(OH)D ≥ 40 ng/ml (100 nmol/L) | Daily with a fat-containing meal | **Strong** for deficiency correction — NIH ODS; Owens et al., 2018 | Indoor-training athletes and those at northern latitudes are at high risk of deficiency. Get 25(OH)D levels tested. Supplement year-round if below 30 ng/ml. |
| **Protein Powder (Whey/Casein)** | Convenient complete protein source to help meet daily targets; whey is fast-absorbing, casein is slow-absorbing | 20–40 g per serving as needed to meet daily protein goals | Post-workout (whey), pre-sleep (casein), or whenever convenient | **Strong** — ISSN, 2017; Not superior to whole food protein, but practically useful | A tool, not a requirement. Useful when whole-food meals are impractical (e.g., immediately post-workout). Whey provides ~25% leucine by amino acid weight — highest of any protein source. |

### Tier 2 — Moderate Evidence

| Supplement | What It Does | Dosage | Timing | Evidence | Hyrox Application |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Beta-Alanine** | Increases muscle carnosine → buffers hydrogen ions → delays fatigue in 1–10 min high-intensity efforts | 3.2–6.4 g/day in divided doses (800 mg × 4–8 servings) for minimum 4 weeks | Daily with meals (loading effect, not acute) | **Moderate** — ISSN Position Stand (Trexler et al., 2015); meta-analysis shows benefit for exercise lasting 60s–10 min | Hyrox stations involve repeated 1–3 min high-intensity bouts. Carnosine buffering could meaningfully reduce fatigue during sled work, rowing, and wall balls. Expect tingling (paraesthesia) — harmless. Use sustained-release formulations to minimise this. |
| **Sodium Bicarbonate** | Alkaline buffer → enhances disposal of hydrogen ions from high-intensity anaerobic work | 0.2–0.3 g/kg, 60–120 min before high-intensity sessions | Acute, pre-session (use serially during specific prep phases to test tolerance) | **Moderate** — Multiple reviews and meta-analyses; individual responses vary | Could benefit Hyrox race performance (sustained high-intensity for 60–90 min). GI distress is the major limitation — **must** be trialled extensively in training. Take with carbohydrate-rich food and divide into smaller doses over 60 min. |
| **Beetroot Juice / Nitrates** | Increases nitric oxide → vasodilation → improved oxygen efficiency; reduces O₂ cost of submaximal exercise | 6.4–12.8 mmol nitrate (typically 500 ml beetroot juice or ~140 ml concentrated shot) | 2–3 hours before exercise; or daily for 3–7 days prior to competition | **Moderate** — AND/DoC/ACSM endorsed; greater benefit in recreational vs elite athletes | May improve running economy during the 8 km of running in Hyrox. Benefit is more likely in sub-elite athletes (which most Hyrox competitors are). May also enhance blood flow to working muscles during station work. |
| **Omega-3 Fatty Acids** | Anti-inflammatory; may support MPS, cardiovascular health, and recovery | 1–3 g/day combined EPA + DHA | Daily with meals | **Moderate** — Philpott et al., 2019; McGlory et al., 2019 | Supports recovery between high-volume training sessions. May reduce exercise-induced muscle soreness (modest effect). Helps maintain joint health during high-impact running. Choose high-quality, third-party tested products. |

### Tier 3 — Weak or Mixed Evidence

| Supplement | What It Does | Dosage | Timing | Evidence | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **BCAAs/EAAs** | Provide branched-chain amino acids for MPS | 10–15 g BCAAs or 10–15 g EAAs | Pre/during/post training | **Weak** — Unnecessary if total daily protein (from complete proteins) is adequate; BCAAs alone cannot maximally stimulate MPS without all EAAs (ISSN, 2017) | **Skip** if eating ≥1.6 g/kg protein from complete sources. Only useful in a fasted training scenario or if protein intake is low. EAAs are marginally better than BCAAs if supplementation is warranted. |
| **Collagen Peptides** | May support tendon, ligament, and cartilage health via increased collagen synthesis | 10–15 g + 50 mg vitamin C | 30–60 min before rehab/prehab exercise | **Weak-to-Moderate** — Shaw et al., 2017 (small study); mechanism plausible but large-scale evidence lacking | Potentially useful for **joint health** in a Hyrox athlete doing high-impact running + sled work. Low risk. Consider during phases of increased joint stress or if experiencing tendon issues. Not a performance supplement. |
| **Ashwagandha** | Adaptogen; may reduce cortisol, improve recovery, modestly increase strength and VO₂max | 300–600 mg/day of root extract (KSM-66 or Sensoril) | Daily, any time | **Weak-to-Moderate** — Some positive RCTs for strength and VO₂max (Choudhary et al., 2015; Wankhede et al., 2015), but evidence is limited and effect sizes are small | May provide marginal benefits in stress management during heavy training blocks. Not harmful. Not a priority. |
| **Tart Cherry Juice** | Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant polyphenols; may reduce DOMS and accelerate strength recovery | 30–60 ml concentrate or 480 ml juice, twice daily | During heavy training blocks; begin 4–5 days before target event | **Weak-to-Moderate** — Some positive results for reducing soreness (Bell et al., 2016; Levers et al., 2016), but studies are small with varied protocols | May slightly reduce soreness after particularly demanding sessions. Use judiciously — chronic high-dose antioxidant intake may blunt training adaptations (see below). Best reserved for competition week or recovery weeks. |

### What to AVOID

| Category | Specifics | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| **High-dose antioxidants (Vitamin C >1,000 mg/day + Vitamin E >400 IU/day)** | These interfere with reactive oxygen species signalling necessary for training adaptation | Paulsen et al. (2014) showed blunted endurance and strength adaptations; recent 2025 study confirmed antioxidant supplementation "counteracts positive muscular adaptations" to sprint interval training. **Do not take mega-dose vitamins C and E during training blocks.** |
| **Testosterone boosters** (Tribulus terrestris, DHEA, D-aspartic acid) | No evidence of efficacy; DHEA is banned by WADA; Tribulus has no effect on testosterone in RCTs | Australian Institute of Sport recommends against. Save your money. |
| **Proprietary "pre-workout" blends** with undisclosed doses | May contain harmful stimulants (DMAA, DMBA); doses of active ingredients often subtherapeutic or excessive | ISSN recommends against proprietary blends. Use individual, evidence-based ingredients at known doses instead. |
| **Fat burners / thermogenics** | Often contain excessive caffeine, synephrine, or other stimulants with poor evidence and cardiovascular risk | Not appropriate for performance athletes. Body composition should be managed through diet and training. |
| **Excessive NSAID use** (ibuprofen, naproxen) as a recovery tool | Chronic NSAID use impairs muscle protein synthesis, tendon healing, and bone remodelling | Limit to acute injury management only, not routine post-training recovery. |

## 4. Sleep Optimisation

### 4.1 Duration Targets

For an athlete training 10–12 hours/week, the research strongly supports **8–10 hours of sleep per night**. The IOC (Reardon et al., 2019) and NCAA position statements define a minimum of 7 hours for adults, but athletes typically require more. The most frequently cited recommendation for sleep extension in athletes is to increase sleep by **46–113 minutes** above habitual ~7 hr baselines (meta-analysis by Bonnar et al.; Vitale et al., 2019).

**Quantified performance impacts of insufficient sleep:**

| Sleep Deficit | Performance Impact |
|---|---|
| <6 hours for 1 night | 15 watts reduced power output in cyclists (Mougin et al., 2001); reaction time impaired |
| <7 hours for 1 night | 1.7× increased injury risk in adolescent athletes (Milewski et al., 2014) |
| Chronic ~6.5 hrs (athlete average) | Reduced glycogen restorage, elevated cortisol, increased perceived exertion (Charest & Grandner, 2020) |
| Sleep extension to 10 hrs | Improved sprint times, reaction time, shooting accuracy, and mood in collegiate athletes (Mah et al., 2011) |

### 4.2 Sleep Quality Metrics

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| Sleep efficiency | >85% (time asleep ÷ time in bed) | Low efficiency indicates fragmented sleep |
| Sleep onset latency | <20 minutes | Indicates appropriate sleep pressure and low hyperarousal |
| Wake after sleep onset (WASO) | <30 minutes total | Excessive waking disrupts deep sleep and REM |
| Deep sleep (SWS) | 15–25% of total sleep time | Critical for growth hormone release, muscle repair, glycogen restorage |
| REM sleep | 20–25% of total sleep time | Critical for motor learning, memory consolidation, emotional regulation |
| Consistency | ±30 min bedtime/wake time daily | Irregular schedules disrupt circadian rhythm and reduce sleep efficiency |

### 4.3 Evidence-Based Pre-Bed Routine

1. **Set a consistent sleep/wake schedule** (±30 min, even on weekends) — this is the single most impactful intervention.
2. **Dim lights 60–90 min before bed** — reduces cortisol and promotes melatonin secretion.
3. **Avoid screens or use blue-light filtering** from 60 min pre-bed.
4. **Cool the bedroom** to 18–20°C (65–68°F) — core body temperature drop initiates sleep onset.
5. **Pre-sleep nutrition:** A small casein-rich snack (cottage cheese, Greek yogurt, or casein shake) can support overnight MPS without disrupting sleep. A high-GI carbohydrate at dinner may improve sleep onset latency (Vlahoyiannis et al., 2018).
6. **Magnesium supplementation** (200–400 mg magnesium glycinate or threonate) 30–60 min before bed may improve subjective sleep quality — evidence is moderate (Abbasi et al., 2012).
7. **Caffeine curfew:** Avoid caffeine at least **6 hours before bed** (ideally 8–10 hours). Caffeine has a half-life of ~5 hours but high individual variability exists (Drake et al., 2013).

### 4.4 Napping

| Recommendation | Details |
|---|---|
| Ideal nap duration | **20–30 min** (power nap) or **90 min** (full sleep cycle) |
| Avoid | 40–60 min naps → increased sleep inertia (grogginess on waking) |
| Best timing | Early-to-mid afternoon (1:00–3:00 PM) to align with natural circadian dip |
| After poor night | A 20–90 min nap can restore performance to baseline levels (PMC10354314) |
| Caution | Napping after 3:00 PM or for >90 min can impair night-time sleep onset |

### 4.5 Sleep After PM Training

Athletes who train in the evening frequently report difficulty falling asleep due to elevated core temperature, sympathetic nervous system activation, and elevated cortisol/adrenaline. Practical strategies:

- Allow **≥2–3 hours** between high-intensity exercise cessation and bed.
- Use a cool shower (not ice cold — comfortably cool) post-workout to accelerate core temperature reduction.
- Keep post-workout nutrition low in caffeine (no pre-workout supplements for PM sessions).
- Use a structured cool-down (10 min easy walking + stretching) to initiate parasympathetic activation.
- Consider relaxation techniques: progressive muscle relaxation, box breathing (4-4-4-4), or guided meditation apps.
- If PM training consistently impairs sleep, consider shifting the hardest sessions to AM/midday when possible.

## 5. Recovery Modalities — Evidence Review

| Modality | Evidence Quality | When to Use | How to Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Foam Rolling / Self-Myofascial Release** | **Moderate** — Meta-analysis (Wiewelhove et al., 2019) shows small reductions in DOMS and small improvements in sprint performance and flexibility | Daily or post-training; particularly after runs and lower-body sessions | 60–120 seconds per muscle group. Slow, sustained pressure on quads, hamstrings, IT band, calves, thoracic spine. Does not "break up" fascia — likely works via neurological pain modulation and increased blood flow. |
| **Static Stretching** | **Weak for performance; Moderate for flexibility** — Pre-exercise static stretching >60s per muscle can transiently reduce strength/power. No consistent evidence for injury prevention or DOMS reduction. | Post-workout cool-down or evening routine; **not** immediately pre-exercise | 15–30 seconds per stretch, 2–3 sets. Focus on chronically tight areas (hip flexors, calves, hamstrings). |
| **Dynamic Stretching** | **Strong for warm-up** — Improves range of motion, activates neuromuscular pathways, and enhances subsequent performance | Pre-every-session as part of warm-up | 5–10 min of movement-specific dynamic stretches: leg swings, walking lunges, arm circles, inchworms, hip circles. |
| **Cold Water Immersion (CWI) / Ice Baths** | **Moderate for acute soreness recovery** — Meta-analyses (Moore et al., 2023; Machado et al., 2016) show CWI reduces DOMS and creatine kinase more than passive recovery. **However**, chronic CWI post-resistance training may blunt muscle hypertrophy and strength adaptations (Roberts et al., 2015). | After extremely demanding sessions (race simulations, competition), **not** after regular strength training | 10–15 min at 10–15°C. Use strategically, not habitually. Reserve for competition recovery or when 2 high-intensity sessions occur within 24 hours. Avoid after strength sessions during hypertrophy phases. |
| **Contrast Water Therapy (Hot/Cold)** | **Weak-to-Moderate** — May enhance perceived recovery and reduce DOMS versus passive recovery, but evidence is less strong than for CWI alone (Moore et al., 2023) | Can use when ice bath is impractical; good psychological benefit | Alternate 1 min cold (10–15°C) / 2 min warm (38–40°C) for 12–15 min total, ending on cold. |
| **Sauna / Heat Exposure** | **Moderate for health; Weak for direct performance recovery** — Regular sauna use improves cardiovascular health (Laukkanen et al., 2015), may stimulate heat shock proteins, and can enhance plasma volume (heat acclimation). Does not directly reduce DOMS. | 2–3 sessions per week; useful as a cardiovascular and relaxation tool, and for heat acclimation if racing in warm conditions | 15–20 min at 80–100°C (traditional Finnish) or 30–40 min at 55–65°C (infrared). Rehydrate aggressively after (500 ml+ fluid with electrolytes). Avoid immediately post-strength training during hypertrophy phases (similar blunting concern as CWI). |
| **Compression Garments** | **Weak-to-Moderate** — Systematic review (Engel et al., 2016) found small positive effects on DOMS reduction and perceived recovery. Mechanism likely relates to reduced swelling via compression and improved venous return. | Wear during long travel, overnight post-hard sessions, or during easy recovery days | Graduated compression tights or sleeves (15–30 mmHg). Effect size is small but risk/cost is low. Primarily a perceptual/comfort benefit. |
| **Massage / Percussion Devices (Theragun, etc.)** | **Moderate for soreness; Weak for performance recovery** — Massage reduces DOMS (Poppendieck et al., 2016 meta-analysis). Percussion devices are less studied but likely provide similar neurological pain modulation as massage/foam rolling. | Post-training or evening recovery routine; targeted on areas of highest soreness or tightness | Massage: 20–30 min sessions 1–2× per week from a sports therapist. Percussion: 30–60 seconds per muscle group at moderate intensity. Avoid directly on joints or bony prominences. |
| **Active Recovery (easy walking, swimming, cycling)** | **Moderate** — Low-intensity activity enhances blood flow, promotes psychological recovery, and may slightly accelerate lactate clearance. Does not impair subsequent training if truly low-intensity. | Day after hard sessions; or as a second session on double-training days | 20–40 min at ≤60% max HR. Walking, easy swimming, or cycling. The session should feel effortless. If heart rate is elevated or if it feels like "work," it's too intense. |

## 6. Nutrition Periodisation Across the 16-Week Program

### Phase 1: General Preparation (Weeks 1–4)
**Training focus:** Aerobic base building, progressive strength loading, movement quality.

**Nutrition strategy:**
- Calories at **maintenance to slight surplus** (+100–200 kcal on training days).
- Carbohydrates: **5–7 g/kg/day** — adequate to fuel increasing volume without excess.
- Protein: **1.8–2.0 g/kg/day** — consistent foundation for muscle protein turnover.
- Fat: **1.0–1.2 g/kg/day** — support hormonal health.
- If body recomposition is a goal, implement the small rest-day deficit here (−200–300 kcal).
- Begin creatine loading (20 g/day × 5–7 days, then 5 g/day maintenance).
- Begin beta-alanine loading (3.2–6.4 g/day — it takes 4+ weeks to saturate muscle carnosine).
- **Practice gut training:** Start trialling intra-workout carbs and race-day nutrition products during long sessions.

---

### Phase 2: Specific Preparation (Weeks 5–10)
**Training focus:** Increased HIIT density, Hyrox-specific station work, race-pace running.

**Nutrition strategy:**
- Calories at **maintenance or slight surplus** — this is not the time to cut; training demands are peaking.
- Carbohydrates: **6–8 g/kg/day** — higher to support glycolytic HIIT work and faster glycogen turnover.
- Protein: **2.0–2.2 g/kg/day** — higher to compensate for increased exercise-induced protein breakdown from concurrent high-intensity work.
- Fat: Minimum **0.8–1.0 g/kg/day**.
- Use intra-workout carbs (30–60 g/hr) during all sessions exceeding 60 minutes.
- Ensure post-workout recovery nutrition is dialed in: 1.0–1.2 g/kg carbs + 0.3 g/kg protein within 2 hours.
- **Discontinue any caloric deficit.** Prioritise fuelling and recovery.
- Omega-3 supplementation (2–3 g EPA/DHA daily) to support inflammation management from high training load.

---

### Phase 3: Competition Preparation (Weeks 11–14)
**Training focus:** Race simulations, pacing practice, maintaining fitness while managing fatigue.

**Nutrition strategy:**
- Calories at **full maintenance** — no deficit whatsoever.
- Carbohydrates: **7–8 g/kg/day** on high-intensity days; **5–6 g/kg** on moderate days.
- Protein: **1.8–2.0 g/kg/day** — maintenance level.
- Trial and finalise **race-day nutrition plan:** Practice the exact pre-race meal, intra-race carb strategy, and caffeine dose during race simulations.
- Continue creatine and beta-alanine. Begin experimenting with sodium bicarbonate (0.2–0.3 g/kg, 90 min pre-session) during high-intensity practice — assess GI tolerance.
- Trial beetroot juice (140 ml concentrate or 500 ml juice) 2–3 hours before race simulations.

---

### Phase 4: Taper (Weeks 15–16)
**Training focus:** Volume reduction (40–60% of peak), maintain intensity, sharpen race-specific speed.

**Nutrition strategy:**

**Week 15 (early taper):**
- Reduce caloric intake proportionally to the **reduced training volume** — roughly a 15–20% reduction from peak training calories.
- Carbohydrates: **5–6 g/kg/day** (reduced from peak).
- Protein: **1.8–2.0 g/kg/day** — maintain; do not reduce protein during taper.
- Sleep: Prioritise ≥9 hours/night. This is the phase where sleep extension provides the greatest performance ROI.
- Continue all supplements at maintenance doses.

**Week 16 (race week):**

| Day | Nutrition Focus |
|---|---|
| **Mon–Wed** (Race-4 to Race-2 days) | Begin **carb loading**: 8–10 g/kg/day. Reduce fibre and fat to accommodate high carb volume without GI distress. Protein at 1.5–1.8 g/kg/day. Choose familiar, easily digestible carb sources: white rice, pasta, bread, pancakes, fruit juice, honey. |
| **Thursday** (Race-1 day) | Continue high-carb intake (8–10 g/kg). Final light 20–30 min shakeout run. Hydrate well. Include **500 mg sodium** with dinner to optimise fluid retention. Go to bed early. |
| **Friday (Race Day — example PM race):** | |
| Breakfast (8:00 AM) | Large high-carb meal: 2–3 g/kg. White toast, jam, banana, oats with honey, orange juice. Low fibre, low fat. |
| Lunch/Snack (11:00 AM–12:00 PM) | Moderate meal: 1–1.5 g/kg carbs. White rice or pasta, lean protein, minimal fat and fibre. |
| Pre-Race (2–3 hrs before start) | Final top-up: 1 g/kg carbs. Energy bar, banana, sports drink. Caffeine (3–6 mg/kg) 60 min before start. |
| Intra-Race | This is covered by the existing race-day protocol in the coaching knowledge base. |

## Original Prompt

```
You are a sports nutrition and recovery researcher building a knowledge base for an AI-powered Hyrox coach. The coach already has race-day nutrition covered. This research covers DAILY nutrition and recovery for athletes in a 16-week Hyrox preparation program.

## Athlete Profile
- Training ~10-12 hours/week (running + strength + HIIT)
- Running 35-40 miles per week
- 4-5 gym sessions per week
- Goal: Hyrox race performance (60-90 minute race duration)

## 1. Daily Macronutrient Framework

### Caloric Needs
- How to estimate daily caloric needs for this training volume
- Training day vs rest day caloric adjustment
- If the goal is body recomposition (maintain muscle, optimize body fat for performance), what caloric approach?

### Protein
- Optimal daily intake (g/kg) for concurrent endurance + strength training
- Current research consensus: is 1.6-2.2 g/kg still the standard?
- Protein distribution: how many meals, how much per meal, does timing matter?
- Pre-sleep protein: casein or total daily intake is what matters?
- Plant-based athlete considerations

### Carbohydrates
- Daily carb targets by training volume (g/kg)
- Carb periodization: high-carb training days vs moderate rest days
- Pre-workout carb loading: timing and amounts for AM vs PM sessions
- Intra-workout carbs: when is it necessary? (sessions >60 min?)
- Post-workout carb replenishment: how much, how fast?
- Low-carb training days: when (if ever) are they appropriate for a Hyrox athlete?

### Fats
- Minimum daily fat intake for hormonal health
- Optimal range for endurance athletes
- Timing: does fat timing around workouts matter?
- Essential fatty acids: omega-3 supplementation evidence

### Create a Sample Day of Eating
For a 180-lb (82kg) male athlete on a high-training day:
- Exact meals with portions, macros, and timing
- Pre-workout meal/snack
- Post-workout meal/snack
- Evening meal

Do the same for a rest/recovery day.

## 2. Hydration Protocol

### Daily Hydration
- Baseline daily fluid intake formula (bodyweight-based)
- How to assess hydration status (urine color, body weight, thirst)
- Electrolyte needs: sodium, potassium, magnesium — daily targets
- When to use electrolyte drinks vs plain water

### Training Hydration
- Pre-training hydration: how much, how far before
- During training: fluid intake rates for different session types and durations
- Post-training rehydration: how much, what to include
- Sweat rate estimation: practical method for athletes

### Create a hydration schedule for a typical training day

## 3. Evidence-Based Supplements

For each supplement, provide: what it does, dosage, timing, evidence quality (strong/moderate/weak), and specific application for Hyrox training.

### Tier 1 — Strong Evidence
- Creatine monohydrate
- Caffeine
- Vitamin D (especially for indoor-training athletes)
- Protein powder (whey/casein) — as convenience, not requirement

### Tier 2 — Moderate Evidence
- Beta-alanine
- Sodium bicarbonate
- Beetroot juice / nitrates
- Omega-3 fatty acids

### Tier 3 — Weak or Mixed Evidence
- BCAAs/EAAs (when are they actually useful?)
- Collagen peptides (for joint health)
- Ashwagandha
- Tart cherry juice

### What to AVOID
- Supplements with no evidence
- Potentially harmful supplements
- Interactions with training adaptations (e.g., high-dose antioxidants blunting adaptation)

## 4. Sleep Optimization

- Sleep duration targets for this training volume
- Sleep quality metrics that matter (deep sleep %, REM, consistency)
- Pre-bed routine for athletes: evidence-based recommendations
- Napping: when helpful, when harmful, optimal duration
- How poor sleep affects next-day training (quantify the performance impact)
- Practical tips for athletes who struggle with sleep after PM training

## 5. Recovery Modalities — Evidence Review

For each modality, rate evidence quality and provide practical recommendations:

| Modality | Evidence | When to Use | How to Use |
|----------|----------|-------------|------------|

- Foam rolling / self-myofascial release
- Static stretching
- Dynamic stretching
- Cold water immersion / ice baths
- Contrast therapy (hot/cold)
- Sauna / heat exposure
- Compression garments
- Massage / percussion devices (Theragun, etc.)
- Active recovery sessions (easy walking, swimming)

## 6. Nutrition Periodization Across the 16-Week Program

How should nutrition change across training phases?
- Phase 1 (General Prep): fueling for volume building
- Phase 2 (Specific Prep): fueling for increased HIIT density
- Phase 3 (Competition Prep): fueling for peak performance
- Phase 4 (Taper): reducing intake as volume drops, carb loading strategy
- Race week: final nutrition preparation (carb loading protocol, specific meals)

IMPORTANT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Length: At minimum 4,000 words. Nutrition is a daily decision — this needs to be comprehensive.
- Format: Use markdown tables for supplement guide, sample meals, and recovery modalities.
- All recommendations must be QUANTIFIED: grams, milliliters, hours, percentages.
- Cite research: ISSN position stands, ACSM guidelines, recent meta-analyses.
- Avoid bro-science. If evidence is weak, say so.
