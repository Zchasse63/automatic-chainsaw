## ⚠️ CRITICAL CORRECTIONS TO V1 MODEL ERRORS

| V1 Model Error | CORRECT Rule (Verified from Official Rulebook) |
|---|---|
| "Split the runs 50/50" | **BOTH partners MUST run ALL 8 × 1km runs TOGETHER. You CANNOT split runs.** |
| "She takes 6 runs, you take 4" | **IMPOSSIBLE. Both partners run all 8 runs. No exceptions.** |
| "Listed 3 stations per partner (6 total)" | **There are 8 stations total. Both partners participate at ALL 8 stations, splitting the WORK at each station however they choose (YGIG principle).** |
| Implied partners each "own" separate stations | **Both partners go to every station together. One works while the other rests, then they switch. They split the reps/distance at EACH station — they do NOT each "take" separate stations.** |

---

## 1. HYROX DOUBLES — OFFICIAL RULES

### 1.1 The Fundamental Running Rule

**Source: Official HYROX Doubles Rulebook Season 25/26, Section 8.2 (Running)**

> *"Both Doubles Team Members (DTMs) must run together for the entire 1,000m between each workout station. If one team member runs ahead, a 1-minute penalty will apply, as this changes the dynamic of a Doubles race."*

**Key rules:**
- ✅ **BOTH partners MUST run ALL 8 × 1km runs TOGETHER**
- ❌ You CANNOT split, alternate, or divide the runs in any way
- Both partners must remain together throughout each 1km run segment
- **"Remain together" is officially defined as being no more than FIVE SECONDS apart at any time**
- **Best practice (per the rulebook): stay within arm's reach of each other**

**Penalty for not staying together:**
- Each infringement detected = **1-minute time penalty** (per run segment and/or workout station)
- Maximum of **3 penalties** allowed per team
- **4th infringement → Out of Competition** (no ranking, no official result)
- The automatic timing system **continuously monitors partner proximity** via timing chips

**What if one partner is significantly faster?**
- The faster partner MUST slow down to match the slower partner
- The faster partner effectively gets "easier" runs (running below their capacity)
- The slower partner is pushed harder (running at or near their capacity)
- This is why **running compatibility is the single most important factor** in partner selection

### 1.2 Station Rules — The YGIG (You Go / I Go) Principle

**Source: Official HYROX Doubles Rulebook Season 25/26, Section 8.2 (Station Rules)**

> *"It is up to each Doubles Team member (DTM) to determine how far in distance or how many reps they complete. Hyrox Doubles workstations follow the principle of 'You Go/I Go' (YGIG) which means whilst one DTM works, the other DTM rests and vice versa."*

**CRITICAL CLARIFICATION: Both partners go to ALL 8 stations together. They do NOT each "take" separate stations.**

**How it actually works (official example from rulebook):**
> *"YGIG Example 1,000 meter Row: DTM 1 starts rowing whilst DTM 2 waits. After a self selected distance (for example 250 meters) DTM 1 switches with DTM 2. DTM 2 continues to Row whilst DTM 1 rests. This process is repeated until the entire distance of 1,000 meters is covered."*

**Key station rules:**
- Only ONE DTM may be active (working) at any time
- The other DTM must rest in the designated area
- The split of reps/distance is **entirely up to the team** — no required ratio
- One partner CAN do 100% of a station if desired (but the other must be present)
- Both partners must **enter the station together** and **exit the station together**
- The workout **cannot begin until both partners are present**
- The station can only be exited **once all reps/distance are completed**
- There is **NO required alternating pattern** — teams choose freely how to divide work at each station
- The split does **NOT need to be decided in advance** — teams can adjust mid-race
- Rest times during stations can be taken as needed, concurrently as well

### 1.3 Station-Specific YGIG Rules

**Source: Official HYROX Doubles Rulebook Season 25/26, Sections 9.1–9.8**

| Station | Total Work | Resting DTM Position | Special Transition Rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SkiErg** | 1,000m | Must remain in marked area | NOT allowed to pass SkiErg handles from one DTM to another |
| **Sled Push** | 50m (4 × 12.5m) | Must walk immediately behind working DTM | Must not walk in neighboring lane |
| **Sled Pull** | 50m (4 × 12.5m) | Must remain behind working DTM at all times | May NOT assist with rope management in any way (hands or feet). MAY offer verbal and physical guidance as long as they don't step on/in the Racer's Box |
| **Burpee Broad Jump** | 80m | Must walk behind working DTM | When transitioning, resting DTM places hands where working DTM's feet landed (toes and fingers in line) |
| **Rowing** | 1,000m | Must remain in marked area behind working DTM | NOT permitted to pass the rower handle, adjust damper, or adjust footstraps for each other |
| **Farmers Carry** | 200m | Must walk behind working DTM | Kettlebells must NOT be passed forward during transitions (sideways or backwards only) |
| **Sandbag Lunges** | 100m | Must walk behind working DTM | Sandbag must NOT be passed forward during transitions (sideways or backwards only) |
| **Wall Balls** | 100 reps | Must remain in marked area underneath the rig | Transition of wall ball by allowing ball to hit floor or handing between DTMs. A "flying transition" (one throws, other catches in squat) is NOT permitted = no-rep |

**Can you coach/encourage your partner during their station?**
- ✅ Yes — verbal encouragement is permitted and recommended
- ✅ At Sled Pull: "It is permitted for the resting DTM to offer verbal and physical guidance"
- ❌ The resting partner must NOT obstruct other racers
- ❌ The resting partner must NOT physically assist with the work (e.g., no touching rope, equipment)

### 1.4 Complete Weight Table — ALL Doubles Divisions

**Source: Official HYROX Doubles Rulebook Season 25/26, Sections 9.1–9.8 (full weight chart on p.8)**

| Station | Women Open | Women Pro / Men Open / **Mixed** | Men Pro |
|---|---|---|---|
| SkiErg | 1,000m | 1,000m | 1,000m |
| Sled Push | 102 kg incl. sled | 152 kg incl. sled | 202 kg incl. sled |
| Sled Pull | 78 kg incl. sled | 103 kg incl. sled | 153 kg incl. sled |
| Burpee Broad Jump | 80m | 80m | 80m |
| Rowing | 1,000m | 1,000m | 1,000m |
| Farmers Carry | 2 × 16 kg (white) | 2 × 24 kg (grey) | 2 × 32 kg (black) |
| Sandbag Lunges | 10 kg (white) | 20 kg (grey) | 30 kg (black) |
| Wall Balls | 100 reps / 4 kg (white) | 100 reps / 6 kg (grey) | 100 reps / 9 kg (black) |
| Wall Ball Target (Women) | 2.70m | 2.70m | — |
| Wall Ball Target (Men) | — | 3.00m | 3.00m |

**CRITICAL NOTE on Mixed Doubles weights:**
- **Both partners (male AND female) use the SAME weight** = Men's Open weights
- This means the female partner in Mixed Doubles uses **heavier weights** than she would in Women's Open Doubles
- The ONLY partial exception is Wall Balls: both use the 6 kg ball, but men throw to the **3.00m target** and women throw to the **2.70m target**
- **There is NO Mixed Pro Doubles division** — Mixed Doubles only exists as Open

**How do Doubles weights compare to Singles?**
- **Doubles Open weights = Singles Open weights** (identical)
- **Doubles Pro weights = Singles Pro weights** (identical)
- The weights do NOT change between Singles and Doubles — only the station work is split between partners
- The total volume at each station is identical to Singles (same 1,000m row, same 100 wall balls, etc.)

### 1.5 Doubles Divisions Available (Season 25/26)

| Division | Team Composition | Weights Used | Pro Version? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Women's Doubles | Two female racers | Women's Open | ✅ Yes (Women's Pro) |
| Men's Doubles | Two male racers | Men's Open | ✅ Yes (Men's Pro) |
| Mixed Doubles | One male + one female | Men's Open (both partners) | ❌ No Pro Mixed |

### 1.6 Timing & Transitions

**Source: Official HYROX Doubles Rulebook Season 25/26, Sections 8.1–8.2**

- The clock runs **continuously** from start to finish — one overall team time
- Both partners wear individual **timing chips on their ankles** (2 chips per Doubles team)
- The timing system continuously monitors both chips for proximity enforcement
- There is **no designated "transition zone"** for Doubles (that's a Relay concept) — partners stay together throughout
- Both DTMs must **enter** a workout station together (workout cannot begin until both present)
- Both DTMs must **exit** a workout station together (after all reps/distance completed)
- Exiting a workout station via the 'IN' arch = **2-minute time penalty**

### 1.7 Doubles Running Pace Strategy

**Based on the rules and verified coaching sources:**

- Both partners run at the **slower partner's sustainable pace**
- The faster partner effectively gets "active recovery" on runs — lower relative effort
- The slower partner is working harder on runs — this is the tradeoff
- Typical strategy: aim for the slower partner's **75-80% effort** pace on runs
- The faster partner's "rest" comes from running below threshold; their station rest comes while partner works
- **HR management implication:** The faster runner will have lower HR on runs, can push harder on stations. The slower runner will have higher HR on runs, may need more station rest or take a smaller share at some stations.

### 1.8 Station Splitting Strategy

**Based on verified coaching sources (HyroxDataLab, competitive experience):**

**There is no required split pattern.** Teams have complete freedom. The five main approaches:

| Strategy | Description | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| **50/50 Even Split** | Each partner does half of every station | First-timers, evenly matched teams |
| **Strength-Based Division** | Each partner does more of their strongest stations (e.g., 70/30) | Experienced teams with complementary strengths |
| **Tag-Team (Frequent Switching)** | Switch every 5-10 reps or 100-200m | Competitive teams wanting to maintain high intensity |
| **Volume-Based Uneven Split** | 60/40 or 70/30 per station based on ability | Teams with moderate fitness differences |
| **Specialist (100/0)** | One partner does entire stations, partner rests | Elite Pro teams ONLY — very high risk |

**Most competitive teams use high-frequency switching** because:
- Short work intervals = less lactic acid accumulation
- Both partners maintain higher intensity
- Built-in micro-recovery during partner's work interval
- Overall station times are faster despite more transitions

**Common station splitting based on partner attributes:**

| If Partner A is... | Consider having Partner A take more of... |
|---|---|
| Stronger upper body | SkiErg, Sled Pull, Rowing |
| Stronger lower body / heavier | Sled Push, Wall Balls, Sandbag Lunges |
| Better cardio/engine | SkiErg, Rowing, Burpee Broad Jumps |
| Better grip strength | Farmers Carry, Sled Pull |
| Taller/heavier (male in Mixed) | Sled Push (bodyweight advantage), Farmers Carry |
| Lighter/shorter (female in Mixed) | Burpee Broad Jumps (less distance per jump but less weight to move), Wall Balls |

**Non-working partner rest durations (approximate):**
- SkiErg 500m share: ~1:30–2:30 rest
- Sled Push 25m share: ~0:30–1:30 rest
- Sled Pull 25m share: ~0:45–1:30 rest
- Burpee Broad Jump 40m share: ~1:30–3:00 rest
- Rowing 500m share: ~1:30–2:30 rest
- Farmers Carry 100m share: ~0:30–1:00 rest
- Sandbag Lunges 50m share: ~1:30–2:30 rest
- Wall Balls 50 reps share: ~1:30–2:30 rest

### 1.9 Training for Doubles

**Recommended split: 70-80% individual training, 20-30% together**

**Together training (1-2x/week) should focus on:**
- Running together at matched pace (critical for penalty avoidance)
- Station transition practice (smooth YGIG switches)
- Communication protocols under fatigue
- Testing different station split strategies
- Race simulations (monthly benchmarks recommended)

**How to decide station splits:**
1. Each partner tests all stations individually at race weight — record times
2. Compare performance ratios at each station
3. Assign more volume to the partner who is faster/stronger at each station
4. Test the split in simulation
5. Build in a "Plan B" for mid-race adjustments

## 2. HYROX RELAY — OFFICIAL RULES

### 2.1 Format

**Source: Official HYROX Relay Rulebook (Season 23/24 — latest publicly available)**

- **4-person team competition**
- Teams can be: 4 males, 4 females, or 2 males + 2 females (Mixed)
- Same overall race structure: 8 × 1km runs + 8 workout stations
- **Each Relay Member (RM) must run 2 × 1km and perform 2 workout stations**
- The assignment of which RM does which runs/stations is **entirely up to the team**
- An RM can do their 2 runs + 2 stations **consecutively** OR come back into the relay at a later point
- Only **ONE** RM is on the course at a time (except during the transition exchange)

### 2.2 Relay Transitions

- A **Transition Zone (TZ)** exists inside the Roxzone
- Only one RM per team allowed in the TZ at a time (until the actual exchange)
- The next RM enters shortly before the exchange
- Exchange protocol: RM 1 finishes station → enters TZ → **taps RM 2 on the shoulder** → RM 1 exits → RM 2 starts running
- **IMPORTANT:** If an RM does 2 consecutive legs back-to-back, they **still must run through the TZ** after each workout (for timing chip reasons)

### 2.3 Relay Weights

**Relay uses the same weights as Open division (gender-specific):**

| Station | Female RM | Male RM |
|---|---|---|
| SkiErg | 1,000m | 1,000m |
| Sled Push | 102 kg incl. sled | 152 kg incl. sled |
| Sled Pull | 78 kg incl. sled | 103 kg incl. sled |
| Burpee Broad Jump | 80m | 80m |
| Rowing | 1,000m | 1,000m |
| Farmers Carry | 2 × 16 kg | 2 × 24 kg |
| Sandbag Lunges | 10 kg | 20 kg |
| Wall Balls | 100 reps / 4 kg / 2.70m target | 100 reps / 6 kg / 3.00m target |

**Mixed Relay:** Each athlete uses the weight for their own gender (unlike Mixed Doubles where both use men's weight).

### 2.4 Relay Strategy

- Each athlete runs ~2.2km total (2 × ~1.1km including Roxzone distance)
- Each athlete does 2 complete stations (100% of each — no splitting within a station)
- Teams choose which 2 stations each member does
- **Each athlete must complete the run immediately preceding their assigned station**
- Strategic assignment: put your strongest athlete on the hardest stations for them (e.g., strongest sled pusher does Sled Push + their choice of another)
- Running order matters: consider fatigue management and who can handle back-to-back legs
- Non-working teammates wait in the spectator area and move to the TZ when their turn approaches

### 2.5 Key Differences: Doubles vs. Relay

| Aspect | Doubles (2 people) | Relay (4 people) |
|---|---|---|
| Running per person | **8km (all 8 runs)** | **~2km (2 runs)** |
| Stations per person | All 8 (split work at each) | 2 complete stations (100% of each) |
| Partners on course | **Both always together** | **Only 1 at a time** |
| Station work | YGIG — split reps/distance | One person does entire station |
| Transition | No transition zone needed | Shoulder-tap in Transition Zone |
| Total team volume | Same as Singles | Same as Singles |

---

## 3. COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS — CORRECTED

| # | Misconception | Reality (Verified) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **"You can split the runs"** | ❌ NO. Both partners MUST run ALL 8 × 1km runs TOGETHER. Running is not divisible. Penalty: 1-min per infringement, DQ after 4th. |
| 2 | **"Each partner takes 4 separate stations"** | ❌ NO. Both partners go to ALL 8 stations together. They split the WORK at each station (YGIG). Neither partner "skips" a station. |
| 3 | **"Doubles is half the work"** | ❌ NO. You run the full 8km (identical to Singles). Station work is split, but running volume is 100% the same. |
| 4 | **"You must split stations 50/50"** | ❌ NO. The split is entirely up to the team. One partner can do 100% of a station if desired. |
| 5 | **"There's a required alternating pattern"** | ❌ NO. No required pattern. Teams choose freely how to divide each station's work. |
| 6 | **"Mixed Doubles uses Women's weights"** | ❌ NO. Mixed Doubles uses MEN'S OPEN weights for BOTH partners. The female partner uses heavier weights than in Women's Doubles. |
| 7 | **"The non-working partner can help"** | ❌ NO (mostly). The resting partner must NOT physically assist. No touching equipment, no passing handles, no rope management. Verbal encouragement IS allowed. |
| 8 | **"You can decide splits beforehand and that's final"** | Partially wrong. You CAN adjust mid-race. Flexibility is recommended. |
| 9 | **"Relay is the same as Doubles but with 4 people"** | ❌ NO. In Relay, each person runs only 2km and does only 2 full stations. In Doubles, each person runs all 8km and participates at all 8 stations. |
| 10 | **"Doubles weights are lighter than Singles"** | ❌ NO. Doubles Open weights = Singles Open weights. Doubles Pro weights = Singles Pro weights. Identical. |

## 4. MIXED DOUBLES vs. SAME-SEX DOUBLES

### 4.1 Weight Differences

| Station | Women's Doubles (Open) | Men's Doubles (Open) | Mixed Doubles |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sled Push | 102 kg | 152 kg | **152 kg (Men's weight for BOTH)** |
| Sled Pull | 78 kg | 103 kg | **103 kg (Men's weight for BOTH)** |
| Farmers Carry | 2 × 16 kg | 2 × 24 kg | **2 × 24 kg (Men's weight for BOTH)** |
| Sandbag Lunges | 10 kg | 20 kg | **20 kg (Men's weight for BOTH)** |
| Wall Balls | 4 kg / 2.70m | 6 kg / 3.00m | **6 kg / Men: 3.00m, Women: 2.70m** |

**Key implication:** The female partner in Mixed Doubles faces significantly heavier weights than in Women's Doubles. This means:
- The male partner often takes a larger share of weighted stations (sled push, sled pull, farmers carry, sandbag lunges)
- The female partner may take more of the machine work (SkiErg, rowing) and bodyweight work (burpees) where the weight difference doesn't apply
- This creates a natural strategic asymmetry that same-sex teams don't have

### 4.2 Rule Differences
- Mixed Doubles exists as **Open only** — there is NO Mixed Pro Doubles division
- At World Championships, Mixed Doubles weights **remain the same** (not bumped to Pro)
- Same-sex Doubles teams at Worlds are bumped to Pro weights (for AG under 60)

### 4.3 Strategy Differences
- Mixed teams tend to have the male partner handle significantly more of the weighted stations
- The female partner typically excels at bodyweight stations and machine work where gender-neutral volumes apply
- Running pace matching is even more critical in Mixed Doubles since men and women often have different natural running paces
- Successful Mixed Doubles teams report the male often does 60-80% of Sled Push/Pull and Farmers Carry, while the female does 60-80% of SkiErg, Rowing, and Burpees

### 4.4 Popularity
- Mixed Doubles is very popular — it's one of the most common entry points for couples/training partners
- Same-sex Men's and Women's Doubles are also popular, especially for competitive athletes targeting Worlds qualification
- No verified data on exact participation ratios was found

## Original Prompt

```
You are a Hyrox rules expert building a knowledge base for an AI-powered Hyrox coach. The coach's v1 model made CRITICAL errors about the Doubles format — it told athletes they could "split the runs 50/50" between partners. This is IMPOSSIBLE in Hyrox Doubles. This research must provide the CORRECT, verified rules.

## CRITICAL CONTEXT
The AI coach previously said:
- "Split the runs 50/50"
- "If she's significantly better, she takes 6 runs, you take 4"
- Then contradicted itself: "Critical rule: You must run together on all 8 runs"
- Listed only 3 stations per partner (6 total) instead of 4 per partner (8 total)

ALL of this is wrong or self-contradictory. We need 100% accurate Doubles/Relay rules.

## 1. Hyrox Doubles — Official Rules

### The Fundamental Rule
- BOTH partners MUST run ALL 8 x 1km runs TOGETHER
- You CANNOT split, alternate, or divide the runs in any way
- Both partners must cross the run timing mats together (or within what margin?)
- What happens if one partner is significantly faster — do they wait?

### Station Splitting
- How many stations does each partner do? (Answer should be 4 each, for 8 total)
- How are stations assigned — is it alternating? Can partners choose?
- Must the split be decided in advance or can you change during the race?
- Is there a required alternating pattern (Partner A does stations 1, 3, 5, 7 and Partner B does 2, 4, 6, 8) or can you choose freely?
- What happens during your partner's station — where do you wait?
- Can you coach/encourage your partner during their station?

### Station Splitting Strategy
- Optimal splitting strategies based on partner strengths
  - Example: If Partner A is stronger upper body, Partner B stronger lower body
  - Example: If one partner is significantly taller/heavier
  - Example: If one partner has better cardio vs better strength
- Which stations are considered "easier" vs "harder" for splitting purposes
- Common splitting mistakes
- Does the non-working partner get to rest (and for how long typically)?

### Doubles Weights
- Are Doubles weights the same as individual Open division?
- Are they the same as individual Pro division?
- Complete weight table for Doubles (sled push, sled pull, sandbag, wall ball, farmer carry)
- Men's Doubles vs Women's Doubles vs Mixed Doubles weight differences

### Doubles Pacing
- Running pace strategy when partners have different speeds
- How to manage the run when one partner is faster
- Heart rate management — the faster partner gets "rest" on runs, the slower partner works harder
- How to use the station rest strategically

### Doubles Transitions
- Where does the non-working partner stand during stations?
- Is there a designated transition zone?
- Any rules about touching/helping your partner at stations?
- Timing: does the clock run continuously? How are station times recorded?

### Training for Doubles
