# Comprehensive HYROX Coach Reference Document: Pacing Strategy & Race Execution

## 1. Pacing Strategy for HYROX

### 1.1 Optimal Pacing for the 1 km Run Segments

#### Should Athletes Negative Split, Even Split, or Positive Split?

The evidence overwhelmingly favours **even pacing** as the gold-standard approach for HYROX. Analysis from the 2022 HYROX World Championships in Las Vegas shows that the **top 5 Elite finishers ran significantly more consistent splits** than the rest of the Elite field, and far more consistent than average Pro division competitors finishing around the 85-minute mark (Rox Lyfe, "How to Pace Your Running at HYROX"). The top performers also showed a **6-second or less difference** between their fastest and slowest 1 km run times across runs 2–7 (HyroxTrainingPlans.com).

The three core strategies break down as follows:

| Strategy | Best For | Risk Level | Time Efficiency |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Negative Split** (start slow, finish fast) | First-time racers, cautious athletes | Low | Good — but leaves 1–3 min on the table |
| **Even Pacing** (consistent effort throughout) | Experienced athletes targeting a specific time | Moderate (requires discipline) | Optimal for most athletes |
| **Controlled Fast Start** (bank time early) | Elite/sub-1:15 men, sub-1:24 women | High | Fastest potential, but highest blow-up risk |

**Recommendation for most athletes:** Even pacing. Athletes who pace evenly (within 10% variance across runs) finish **5–10% faster** than those who sprint early and fade late (HyroxDataLab). The data is unambiguous: consistent pacing isn't about holding back — it's about distributing effort optimally.

#### How Does Pacing Change Across the 8 Runs?

A subtle adjustment is expected even in "even pacing" strategies because of **cumulative fatigue**. Expect runs 5–8 to be **10–20 seconds/km slower** than runs 1–2, which is physiologically normal and should be planned for rather than fought against (HyroxDataLab Pacing Calculator Guide).

Key nuances about specific run segments:

- **Run 1:** The first run is often shorter or longer than 1 km due to the start line being in a different place from the RoxZone exit. At the 2022 World Championships, **the top 5 Elite finishers went out relatively slower** on the first run compared to the rest of the Elite field, who in turn went out slower than the average Pro competitor. The athletes with the slowest overall times tended to go out the fastest on Run 1 (Rox Lyfe). Start 5–10 seconds/km slower than your target pace on Run 1.
- **Runs 2–4:** Settle into target pace. This is the "find your rhythm" zone. Resist the urge to speed up because you feel good — this is glycogen you'll desperately need later.
- **Runs 5–7:** The grind. Allow a natural 10–15 sec/km slowdown. Don't panic if your pace drops slightly — this is expected. What matters is **consistent effort**, not consistent pace.
- **Run 8:** The final run often feels longer because it includes extra distance to reach the wall ball station. Manage expectations accordingly. If you've paced well, you may have enough to push slightly harder here, but the priority is arriving at wall balls with enough in the tank for 75–100 reps.

#### Target Run Paces by Goal Finish Time

| Goal Finish Time | Avg Run Pace (per km) | Avg Station Time Budget (all 8) | Total RoxZone Budget |
|---|---|---|---|
| **2:00:00** (Beginner) | 6:15–6:30/km | ~52:00 (avg ~6:30/station) | ~11:00 |
| **1:45:00** (Intermediate-) | 5:30–5:45/km | ~44:00 (avg ~5:30/station) | ~10:00 |
| **1:30:00** (Intermediate+) | 5:00–5:25/km | ~37:00 (avg ~4:40/station) | ~9:00 |
| **1:15:00** (Advanced) | 4:30–4:45/km | ~29:00 (avg ~3:40/station) | ~7:00 |
| **1:10:00** (Elite) | 4:15–4:30/km | ~27:30 (avg ~3:25/station) | ~5:00 |

**How to determine your individual pace:** Run 1 km at approximately 85% of your max heart rate on a track. The time you record is a rough proxy for your per-km target at HYROX. Alternatively, your HYROX run pace will typically align with your **half-marathon or marathon pace** — not your 5K pace. Most athletes' HYROX run splits are significantly slower than their 10K race pace due to the accumulated fatigue from stations (Rox Lyfe).

### 1.2 Heart Rate Zone Management Across the Entire Race

#### Target HR Zones: Runs vs Stations vs Transitions

Heart rate management is critical because HYROX forces constant toggling between aerobic (running) and anaerobic (station) efforts over 60–150 minutes. One data point from Precision Hydration: an athlete completing HYROX in 70 minutes had an **average heart rate of 154 bpm — 96% of max HR**. That's the equivalent sustained effort of a half marathon.

| Race Phase | Target HR Zone | % Max HR | Perceived Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Runs 1–3** | Zone 3 (High Aerobic) | 70–78% | Conversational to moderately hard; can speak in short sentences |
| **Runs 4–6** | Zone 3–4 (Tempo/Threshold) | 75–85% | Uncomfortable but controlled; sentences become difficult |
| **Runs 7–8** | Zone 4 (Threshold) | 80–88% | Hard; racing effort, fuelled by remaining reserves |
| **Stations (SkiErg, Row)** | Zone 4 (Threshold) | 80–88% | Controlled intensity, not maximal |
| **Stations (Sled Push/Pull)** | Zone 4–5 (Threshold–VO2max) | 85–92% | Near-max leg effort; expect HR spike |
| **Stations (Burpees, Lunges, Wall Balls)** | Zone 4 (Threshold) | 80–90% | Sustained muscular endurance |
| **Farmers Carry** | Zone 3–4 | 78–85% | Brisk walk; grip and posture challenge more than cardiovascular |
| **RoxZone Transitions** | Zone 2–3 (Recovery/Aerobic) | 65–75% | Active recovery; jog lightly, don't walk or stand still |

#### How HR Drift Affects Pacing in the Second Half

**Cardiac drift** — the gradual upward creep of heart rate at the same pace — is inevitable over 60–150 minutes of sustained effort. As core temperature rises, plasma volume decreases (from sweating), and glycogen stores deplete, the heart must beat faster to deliver the same cardiac output.

Practical implications:
- **By run 5–6**, the same pace that kept you at 75% max HR in run 1 may now produce 82–85% max HR. This is normal.
- **Don't chase the same HR numbers** in the second half. Instead, shift to monitoring **perceived effort** and **pace**. If your pace is within 10–20 sec/km of your early splits and you feel "controlled hard," you're on track.
- **If HR exceeds 90–92% max for sustained periods** during runs in the second half, you need to slow down. Continuing at that intensity will cause a dramatic fade and potentially compromise your ability to complete stations.
- **Dehydration accelerates drift.** Every 1% loss in bodyweight from sweat can increase HR by 5–8 bpm. This is why hydration strategy matters enormously (see Section 2.4).

#### HR Ceiling to Avoid Early in the Race

The single most important HR rule for HYROX: **do not exceed 85% of max HR during the first three run segments**. Going above this threshold in the early stages depletes glycogen disproportionately fast, spikes lactate accumulation, and accelerates core temperature rise — all of which compound exponentially in the second half (HyroxTrainingPlans.com, Bend and Mend Physiotherapy).

Think of it as a **"spending budget."** The aerobic energy you save in runs 1–3 by staying at 70–78% max HR is the exact energy you'll need to maintain technique during wall balls and push through runs 7–8.

### 1.3 Station-Specific Pacing

#### SkiErg (1,000 m)

The SkiErg is Station 1 — the very first functional exercise after Run 1. The temptation to blast it (fresh legs, adrenaline) is real, but the risk/reward is poor. Analysis shows the SkiErg has one of the **lowest time variances** across finish-time brackets — only about 22 seconds separating a 1:20 finisher from a 1:40 finisher (HyroxDataLab). Meaning: going 15 seconds faster here by redlining your effort costs far more energy than the time it saves.

| Metric | Beginner (2:00 goal) | Intermediate (1:30 goal) | Elite (1:10 goal) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Target /500m split | 2:45–3:00 | 2:05–2:15 | 1:50–1:55 |
| Stroke rate | 35–40 spm | 40–50 spm | 48–55 spm |
| Total station time | ~6:00 | ~4:30 | ~3:50 |

**Pacing breakdown:**
- **First 200 m:** 60–70% effort. Establish rhythm and breathing pattern. Do not sprint (RMR Training, Centr/Meg Jacobi).
- **Middle 600 m:** Lock into target pace. Maintain stroke rate at 45–55 spm. This should feel like your **5K running effort** — strong but controlled (RMR Training, James Hall).
- **Final 200 m:** Increase effort only if sustainable. Prepare mentally for the transition to Run 2.

**Key coaching cue:** "Sacrificing a few seconds on your overall ski time will yield a better run afterward — where there is more to gain. Risk to reward!" — Meg Jacobi, HYROX athlete (Centr).

**Technique note:** Drive power from the legs and core, not just the arms. Hinge at the hips, engage the lats, and pull through with full extension. Arm-dominant athletes will burn out their shoulders — which they need for sled pull, rowing, and wall balls later.

#### Sled Push (4 × 12.5 m lengths)

The sled push is Station 2, and it is **where more races are lost than any other station**. At the 2023 North American Championships, many elite male competitors reportedly destroyed their race by going too fast on the sled push (Rox Lyfe). The problem is physics: once you stop the sled, static friction is **3–5 times greater** than kinetic friction, meaning restarting costs enormously more energy than keeping the sled crawling forward (HyroxTrainingPlans.com).

| Metric | Beginner (2:00 goal) | Intermediate (1:30 goal) | Elite (1:10 goal) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total station time | ~5:00 | ~3:30 | ~2:30 |
| Strategy | Stop-and-go with 3–5 sec rests | Continuous with minor slow-downs | Continuous, aggressive |

**Continuous vs stop-and-go:**
- **Continuous (recommended for intermediate+):** Never let the sled fully stop. If you need to "rest," slow to a crawl but keep the sled moving. Even 1–2 inches per second of movement is better than zero. This avoids the massive energy cost of breaking static friction every time you restart.
- **Stop-and-go (acceptable for beginners):** If you must stop, keep rests to **3–5 seconds maximum** (Rezerv.co). Stop approximately **5 steps before your legs start burning** — lactic acid clearance is exponential, so the more you accumulate, the longer recovery takes (Women's Health/HYROX coach advice).

**Technique essentials:**
- Keep body low — 45-degree angle between torso and ground.
- Use short, choppy steps: **6–8 inch steps, 120+ steps per minute cadence** (HyroxTrainingPlans.com). Long strides create a stop-start pattern.
- First 3 steps of each length: MAX effort to break static friction.
- Breathe rhythmically: exhale every 2–3 steps.
- Arms: extended (for leverage) or slightly bent — experiment in training.

**Post-sled recovery:** Take 5 deep breaths with hands on knees. Shake out quads before transitioning. The run immediately after sled push (Run 3) is where you'll feel the worst. Expect it. Accept a 10–15 sec/km pace drop.

#### Sled Pull (Hand-Over-Hand)

The sled pull is Station 3. It's less about brute strength and more about **minimising dead time between pulls**.

**Pacing strategy:**
- Run (don't walk) to the far end of the lane to set up.
- Sit or brace your feet, lean back, and begin pulling hand-over-hand with steady, rhythmic pulls.
- **Minimise rest between rope grabs.** Most time lost at sled pull is from athletes taking long pauses between pulls of the rope and walking slowly between lengths (Rox Lyfe).
- Keep a consistent rhythm: think of it like climbing a rope — one hand immediately follows the other.
- Once the sled reaches you, stand up quickly, run (don't walk) back to the start, and begin again.

| Metric | Beginner (2:00 goal) | Intermediate (1:30 goal) | Elite (1:10 goal) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total station time | ~6:00 | ~4:00 | ~3:00 |

**Key coaching cue:** "Hustle on sled pull. You can push yourself a little more here without compromising yourself for the rest of the race" (Rox Lyfe). Chalk your hands beforehand — grip failure means dropped ropes and wasted time.

#### Burpee Broad Jumps (80 m)

Station 4. This is the most metabolically brutal station — it combines a full-body power movement (burpee) with explosive horizontal displacement (broad jump). The station typically takes **3–6 minutes** depending on fitness level (HyroxTrainingPlans.com).

**Rep tempo and pacing:**
- **Conservative pacing (recommended):** Start at 70–80% max intensity. Find a rhythm and maintain **consistent jump distance** throughout. Do NOT sprint the first 20m and limp the last 60m.
- **Target rep tempo:** Aim for one complete burpee broad jump every **3.5–5 seconds** depending on your level.
- **When to slow down vs push:** If your jump distance drops below ~1.2m (indicating muscular failure), slow your tempo slightly rather than attempting explosive jumps that cover no distance. Maintaining consistent distance per jump is more efficient than variable bursts.
- **Break strategy:** Unlike wall balls, burpee broad jumps don't lend themselves well to formal "break sets." Instead, maintain a steady rhythm. If you must pause, take **2–3 breaths standing** then resume — do NOT sit or lie down (George Anderson's "Get Out of the Chair" principle from Rox Lyfe).

**Key coaching cue:** "Avoid the burst-and-pause approach. Instead, find a steady pace you can maintain" (Women's Health).

#### Rowing (1,000 m)

Station 5. The row comes at the midpoint of the race, after the devastating burpee broad jumps. Your heart rate will be elevated; your goal is to use the rower as a **controlled reset**, not another sprint.

| Metric | Beginner (2:00 goal) | Intermediate (1:30 goal) | Elite (1:10 goal) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Target /500m split | 2:30–2:45 | 2:05–2:20 | 1:50–1:55 |
| Stroke rate | 22–26 spm | 24–28 spm | 26–30 spm |
| Total station time | ~6:00 | ~4:45 | ~3:50 |

**Pacing formula:** Your HYROX row pace should be approximately **your 2K rowing time trial pace + 10 seconds per 500m** (RMR Training/James Hall). This feels "strong but controlled" — not like you're hunting a PR.

**Technical emphasis:**
- **Power through the legs** (70% leg drive, 20% back, 10% arms). Arm-dominant rowing is inefficient and will fatigue your biceps and grip for farmers carry later.
- **Keep stroke rate steady at 24–28 spm.** Avoid fluctuations — each surge and recovery wastes energy.
- **Monitor the /500m split display** and aim for consistency from the first stroke to the last.

The rowing station, like the SkiErg, has **very low time variance** across finish-time brackets (~28 seconds; HyroxDataLab). Going 10 seconds faster by sprinting is not worth the energy it costs.

#### Farmers Carry (200 m)

Station 6. This station is unique in that **you should go as fast as humanly possible** (Rox Lyfe, "Full Send Farmers"). Here's why: grip endurance is the limiting factor, and the longer you hold the kettlebells, the worse it gets. Speed reduces total time under load.

| Metric | Beginner (2:00 goal) | Intermediate (1:30 goal) | Elite (1:10 goal) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total station time | ~4:00 | ~2:30 | ~1:10–1:30 |
| Pace | Brisk walk, 1–2 stops | Fast walk, 0–1 stops | Near-jog, unbroken |

**Walk pace:** Move at the fastest sustainable walk (or light jog) you can manage. Think "power walk" — upright posture, arms locked, short quick steps.

**Grip management:**
- **Chalk your hands** before starting — sweaty palms are the #1 cause of dropped kettlebells (Rox Lyfe).
- Maintain **tall posture**: shoulders packed, chest up, core braced. Dr. Adam Storey (HYROX Sports Science Advisory Council) classifies the farmers carry as a **"postural endurance test"** — the athlete who maintains upright posture the longest maintains their speed the longest (Rox Lyfe Farmers Carry Guide).
- **When to set down:** Only if you physically cannot hold on. Every stop costs ~5–10 seconds (setting down + shaking out + picking up + re-gripping). Aim for 0 stops if targeting sub-1:30, 0–1 stops if targeting sub-2:00.
- There is **no penalty for setting the kettlebells down** (unlike the sandbag in lunges), but every stop kills your time.

**Coaching cue:** "You don't really need much grip strength for the rest of the race. So going all out on the farmers is worthwhile." (Rox Lyfe).

#### Sandbag Lunges (100 m)

Station 7. Data from HyroxDataLab's analysis of HYROX Utrecht shows that sandbag lunges are a **high-leverage station** with massive time variance (87–88 seconds across finish-time brackets) but **near-zero correlation with Run 8 performance** (r = -0.084 for men, -0.072 for women). This demolishes the common "save legs for the final run" myth.

**Step tempo:**
- Target **0.9–1.1 m step length** (100–110 total steps for men, 110–120 for women).
- Longer steps shift load from quads → glutes/hamstrings, which **preserves quads for wall balls** (the very next station, where correlation is strong: r = 0.738).
- **Constant movement** — touch-and-go on the back knee. Do not pause at the bottom of each rep.
- Step cadence: approximately one lunge every 2.5–3.5 seconds.

**Breathing pattern:** Exhale forcefully on the drive up (concentric phase), inhale at the bottom (eccentric phase). Keep breathing rhythmic and tied to movement.

| Metric | Beginner (2:00 goal) | Intermediate (1:30 goal) | Elite (1:10 goal) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total station time | ~8:00 | ~5:00–5:30 | ~3:30–4:15 |
| Step count target | 130–150 | 100–120 | 90–105 |

**Coaching cue:** "Attack the sandbag lunges aggressively. The time you lose going slow hurts your finish time directly, while the theoretical fatigue you're avoiding doesn't materially impact your final run." (HyroxDataLab).

#### Wall Balls (75 reps women / 100 reps men)

Station 8 — the final functional station. You're exhausted, your quads are wrecked from lunges, and you have 75–100 reps between you and the finish line. **A break strategy is essential.**

**Break strategies:**

| Strategy | Reps Pattern | Rest Between Sets | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| Aggressive (Unbroken) | 100 straight | None | Elite athletes with exceptional fitness |
| Semi-Aggressive | 25-25-25-25 or 30-30-25-15 | 3–5 sec | Strong intermediate athletes |
| Conservative | 20-20-20-20-20 | 3–5 sec | Most athletes — **recommended** |
| Very Conservative | 15-15-15-15-15-10-15 | 5–8 sec | Beginners or athletes with poor upper body endurance |

**Rep tempo:** Each wall ball rep should take approximately **2.5–3.5 seconds** (catch → squat → drive → release → catch). Find a metronome-like rhythm and lock in.

**Key coaching cue:** "If you start off by doing as many as you can (say you manage 40 unbroken) but that leaves your shoulders completely fried and massively slows you down for the remainder, then you didn't pace appropriately. It's possible you should have just done 25 and had a very short pause before carrying on." (Rox Lyfe).

**Technique under fatigue:** Keep feet planted, use **legs** (not arms/shoulders) to generate upward force. If the ball starts hitting below the target line, you're burning out — take a micro-break rather than accumulating no-reps from the judge.

### 1.4 When to Push vs Conserve: Station Reward Analysis

Not all stations reward aggressive pacing equally. Based on data analysis from HyroxDataLab and coaching literature:

| Station | Variance Across Finish Brackets | Push or Conserve? | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SkiErg** | Low (22 sec) | **Conserve** — controlled, 70–80% effort | Minimal time gain from going harder; high energy cost |
| **Sled Push** | Moderate-High | **Conserve** — steady, never stop | Lactic acid from over-pushing destroys subsequent runs |
| **Sled Pull** | Moderate | **Moderate push** — hustle between pulls | Dead time (walking, resting) is the biggest time sink |
| **Burpee Broad Jumps** | High (107 sec) | **Steady push** — consistent tempo | Burst-and-pause approach is worse than sustained rhythm |
| **Rowing** | Low (28 sec) | **Conserve** — strong but controlled | Same as SkiErg; diminishing returns from extra effort |
| **Farmers Carry** | Low (26 sec) | **Full send** — go as fast as possible | Speed reduces time under load; grip doesn't matter after |
| **Sandbag Lunges** | High (87–88 sec) | **Attack aggressively** | Near-zero correlation with Run 8; huge time-gain opportunity |
| **Wall Balls** | Highest (146 sec) | **Controlled push** — smart break strategy | Highest variance = biggest training/execution payoff |

**Summary principle:** Conserve on the machines (SkiErg, Row) where extra effort yields minimal time savings but massive energy cost. Attack the high-variance bodyweight/loaded stations (lunges, wall balls, burpees) where execution and fitness translate directly into large time gains.

## 2. Common Mistakes & Race Execution

### 2.1 Most Common Training Mistakes in HYROX Preparation

#### Neglecting Running Volume

HYROX is **50% running** (8 km total), yet many gym-goers disproportionately focus on station work. As Gymshark's HYROX training guide bluntly states: "Train like you are training for a half marathon, and as long as you can do the movements, you can't go wrong." If you can't comfortably run 8 km, no amount of sled push strength will save you (Gymshark, Connect the Watts).

**The fix:** Run 2–3 days per week minimum. Include one long easy run (Zone 2, 45–60 min), one tempo/threshold run (Zone 4, 20–30 min), and one interval session. Build to ~25–35 km/week if targeting sub-1:30 (Rox Lyfe, Connect the Watts).

#### Over-Focusing on Strength at the Expense of Endurance

HYROX is not a 1-rep max test. The sled weighs 152 kg (men) or 102 kg (women) and must be pushed repeatedly, not once. A massive squat won't help if you can't push the sled for 50 m without extended breaks (Connect the Watts).

**The fix:** Train **strength-endurance**: moderate loads, higher reps (12–20), shorter rest periods (60–90 sec). Use race-weight loads in training regularly. If you can deadlift 200 kg but can't push the race sled without stopping 6 times, your training is misaligned.

#### Not Practicing Transitions

The RoxZone (transition area) can account for **5–11 minutes** of total race time. Every second wasted walking, standing, or lingering at water stations adds up across 8 transitions. Many athletes unknowingly add 2–4 minutes by treating transitions as rest periods (Rox Lyfe, Connect the Watts).

**The fix:** In training, set up stations so you must run/walk briskly into them. Practice flowing from a run directly into station work without hesitation. Aim for RoxZone times of **under 1:00–1:15 per transition** for intermediate athletes and **under 45 seconds** for advanced (HyroxDataLab).

#### Not Doing Full Simulations

The standardised format of HYROX makes it tempting to simulate the full race frequently — but doing full simulations too often risks overtraining and injury. Conversely, **never** doing one means you won't know how station-to-station fatigue compounds (Rox Lyfe, 3in1Sports).

**The fix:** Complete **1–2 full HYROX simulations** (or scaled half-simulations) in the 6–8 weeks before your race. These should be at race pace. "A realistic HYROX plan is not just a thought experiment — it's a plan you *test*" (3in1Sports). Beyond that, train station-specific work in smaller, targeted blocks with progressive overload.

---

### 2.2 Most Common Race-Day Execution Errors

#### Going Out Too Fast on Run 1

This is the **single most common mistake** in HYROX. Adrenaline, crowd energy, and 50 other athletes sprinting beside you create an irresistible urge to hammer the first kilometre. The data from the 2022 World Championships shows that **slower overall finishers went out relatively faster on Run 1**, while the fastest finishers were deliberately conservative at the start (Rox Lyfe).

**The fix:** Write your target Run 1 split on your wrist. Use a GPS watch with a lap timer. Trust the data, not the feeling. "Consistent pacing will almost certainly mean deliberately slowing yourself towards the start of the race. You will likely feel like you could be going faster — and many athletes around you *will* be going faster. This can be mentally challenging." (Rox Lyfe).

#### Poor Sled Technique Wasting Energy

Bad technique — high body angle, long strides, and full stops between lengths — can cost **60–120 seconds** and leave your quads destroyed for subsequent runs. Many athletes treat the sled push like a sprint rather than a sustained grind (Connect the Watts, HyroxTrainingPlans.com).

**The fix:** Keep body at a 45-degree angle, use short choppy steps (120+ cadence), and **never let the sled fully stop**. Static friction requires 3–5x more force to overcome than kinetic friction. Slow to a crawl if you must, but keep the sled moving (HyroxTrainingPlans.com).

#### Not Having a Wall Ball Break Strategy

Going for an unbroken set of 75–100 wall balls when you haven't trained for it leads to complete muscular failure around rep 35–45, followed by agonisingly long rests and a total time that's **worse** than if you'd planned breaks from the start (Rox Lyfe).

**The fix:** Determine your break strategy in training. For most athletes, **sets of 20–25 with 3–5 second rests** is optimal. Commit to this plan regardless of how you feel at the start of the station.

#### Ignoring Nutrition and Hydration

HYROX typically lasts 60–150 minutes at near-maximal sustained effort. Studies show that 40–50% of recreational athletes begin exercise in a **mildly dehydrated state** (Precision Hydration). Starting under-fuelled means glycogen depletion kicks in around Station 4–5, causing dramatic power output drops and cognitive decline.

**The fix:** See Section 2.4 below for a complete fuelling protocol.

---

### 2.3 Race-Day Nutrition and Hydration

#### Pre-Race Meal Timing and Composition

| Timing | What to Eat | Quantity |
|---|---|---|
| **Day before** | Carb-loading: aim for 8 g carbs/kg bodyweight | E.g., 640 g carbs for an 80 kg athlete |
| **Night before** | Preload hydration: strong electrolyte drink (1500 mg sodium) + 500 ml water | 1 serving |
| **2–3 hours before** | High-carb, low-fibre, low-fat meal (toast, rice, porridge, bagel) | ~100–150 g carbs |
| **1–2 hours before** | Carb-rich snack (energy bar, rice cake, banana) | ~30–50 g carbs |
| **90 minutes before** | Electrolyte preload: 1500 mg sodium + 500 ml water | 1 serving |
| **20–30 minutes before** | Caffeine gel or chew (if tolerated; 3–6 mg/kg caffeine) | 1 gel (~30 g carbs) |

*Sources: Precision Hydration, AidStation/Ash Miller (Dietitian), StartHyrox*

**Critical rule:** Never try new nutrition on race day. Test everything — gels, electrolytes, pre-race meals — during training sessions first. Energy gels cause GI distress in some people, and discovering this mid-race is catastrophic (Rox Lyfe).

#### During-Race Fuelling

| Race Duration | Fuelling Protocol |
|---|---|
| **Under 75 min** | Pre-race fuelling should carry you through. Carry 1 gel for a mid-race boost if needed. Sip water at RoxZone stations. |
| **75 min – 2 hours** | Aim for **30–60 g carbs per hour** via gels or chews. Take them during RoxZone transitions or less intense moments (e.g., after farmers carry). Carry a 500 ml soft flask with electrolytes. |
| **Over 2 hours** | Aim for **30–60 g carbs per hour.** Plan 2–3 gels across the race. Carry electrolyte flask. Take additional fluid at every water station. |

**Timing tip:** A good moment for a mid-race gel is **after Station 4 (burpee broad jumps), just before Run 5** — you're at the halfway point, and the carbohydrates will take ~20–30 minutes to hit your bloodstream, providing a boost precisely when the second-half grind begins (AidStation).

#### What to Consume at Water Stations

The RoxZone water stations are your only opportunity for mid-race hydration. Take **small sips** — 100–200 ml maximum — to manage thirst without causing sloshing or GI discomfort. If carrying a soft flask with electrolytes, take a larger sip from that. Do not stop moving while drinking. Walk briskly or jog while sipping (Precision Hydration, Rox Lyfe).

### 2.4 Warm-Up Protocols

#### Timing

| Event | Timing |
|---|---|
| Arrive at venue | 60–90 minutes before wave start |
| Begin warm-up | 30–45 minutes before wave start |
| Complete warm-up | 5–10 minutes before wave start |
| Total warm-up duration | 12–20 minutes of active work |

#### Specific Warm-Up Routine

**Phase 1: Aerobic Activation (7–10 minutes, starting ~45 min out)**
- Light jog, bike, or row at easy effort (Zone 1–2)
- Goal: raise core temperature, activate aerobic system
- Don't worry if you feel sluggish — pre-race jitters are normal (RMR Training)

**Phase 2: Intensity Ramp (5–8 minutes, starting ~30 min out)**
- Run 3 minutes at marathon pace
- 500 m SkiErg at target race pace (your 2K pace + 5–7 seconds)
- Or 3–4 rounds of: 1 min run + 1 min SkiErg/Row + 1 min bike (RMR Training)
- Goal: elevate HR to race-ready levels without depleting energy

**Phase 3: Mobility and Station-Specific Drills (5–10 minutes, starting ~15 min out)**
- Hip flexors and quads (running, lunges)
- Shoulders and lats (SkiErg, rowing, wall balls)
- Ankles and calves (running, jumping)
- Practice light reps: push sled 10 m, 3–5 burpee broad jumps, carry farmer handles 10–15 m, 5–10 wall balls
- Goal: coordination and confidence, not fatigue (RMR Training, BLDRSports)

**Phase 4: Final Priming (3–5 minutes, starting ~10 min out)**
- 2–3 × 20–30 second race-pace pickups with walking recovery
- 4–6 × 100 m strides at ~800 m pace (RMR Training)
- This primes the nervous system and makes Run 1 feel familiar
- Put on race shoes and test with a few strides

**Phase 5: Mental Reset (final 2–3 minutes)**
- Deep breathing exercises
- Visualise your first 3 stations
- Review pacing plan (written on wrist or arm)
- Find your mantra or focus word

#### Common Warm-Up Mistakes

- **Skipping it entirely** — leaves you sluggish through Run 1 and SkiErg
- **Overdoing it** — a 30-minute high-intensity warm-up depletes energy you need for the race
- **Trying new movements** — the warm-up is for activation, not experimentation
- **Letting the warm-up dictate expectations** — how you feel warming up often does not predict race performance (RMR Training)

### 2.5 Mental Models Used by Top Competitors

#### "Station + Next Run = One Unit" Mindset

Rather than thinking of HYROX as 16 individual segments (8 runs + 8 stations), elite competitors chunk the race into **8 units**, each consisting of one station and the subsequent run. This reframing reduces the cognitive load of "16 things to get through" to "8 blocks, one at a time."

Within each unit, the station is the work and the run is the recovery. This prevents the demoralising feeling of finishing a brutal station only to face "another run." Instead, the run is part of the same block — your body's chance to flush lactate and reset before the next block begins.

#### Process Goals vs Outcome Goals

Top competitors focus on **process goals** during the race rather than outcome goals:

- ❌ Outcome goal: "I need to finish in 1:28"
- ✅ Process goal: "Hit 5:15 on this kilometre" or "Do 25 wall balls, then break"

Process goals keep you focused on the controllable present moment. Outcome goals create anxiety about the future and tempt you to make irrational mid-race decisions (like sprinting Run 3 to "bank time").

**Framework for setting race-day process goals:**
1. Write target splits for each segment on your wrist band
2. At the start of each segment, state your goal: "This run is 5:20"
3. At the end of each segment, assess: "Did I hit it? If not, what's the adjustment?"
4. Move on. Don't carry frustration from one segment to the next.

#### Self-Talk Strategies

George Anderson (well-being and performance coach featured on Rox Lyfe) recommends several self-talk frameworks:

- **"Get Out of the Chair":** When overwhelmed by what's ahead (80 m of burpee broad jumps, for example), don't think about the full distance. Just focus on doing the first rep. Then the next. "Get that first burpee done rather than dwelling on 80 metres of them." This short-term focus keeps you present and moving (Rox Lyfe/George Anderson).

- **"Embrace the Suck":** Reframe pain as a signal that you're giving 5–10% more, not that something is wrong. "Those feelings of pain and exertion can be quite unnerving if you aren't used to it. When you instead see them as signals that you're giving another 5–10%, and that it's not going to get any worse, and you just need to sustain this for a short period of time, that does something quite fundamental to your motivation." (George Anderson, Rox Lyfe).

- **"Through the Line":** Never ease up before a segment is complete. Always push through the finish of each station and each run. "Don't lose that last little bit of performance which could make it or break it." (George Anderson, Rox Lyfe).

- **Aggressive vs Passive Self-Talk:** Research on self-talk in endurance sport suggests that **instructional** ("Drive your knees") and **motivational** ("Let's go!") cues are more effective than reassuring cues ("I can do this"). Use commanding, action-oriented language.

#### Managing the Pain Cave in Runs 5–8

Runs 5 through 8 are where HYROX becomes a mental battle. Cumulative fatigue, glycogen depletion, and HR drift converge to make every step feel harder. Here's the mental framework used by top competitors:

1. **Break the remaining race into shrinking chunks:** After Run 5, you have "only 3 stations left." After Run 6, "only 2." This creates a sense of acceleration even as your body is decelerating.

2. **Use external focus:** Count laps, watch other athletes, engage with the crowd. Internal focus ("my legs hurt") amplifies perceived effort. External focus ("I need to pass that person ahead") reduces it.

3. **Reframe the suffering:** As Liz Yelling (world-class distance runner) explained to George Anderson: "What sets the top performers apart is their willingness to suffer — their ability to embrace discomfort and simply endure more pain than others." The athletes around you are suffering equally. The question is: who keeps moving?

4. **Nutritional intervention:** If you haven't already taken your mid-race gel, Run 5 is the time. The psychological effect of "I just took fuel, I'll feel better in 10 minutes" is almost as powerful as the actual carbohydrate boost.

5. **Station countdown:** After every station in the second half, mentally cross it off. "Rowing is done. I will never row again today. Three to go." This is especially powerful after the farmers carry (Station 6), where you can remind yourself: "Only lunges and wall balls stand between me and the finish."

6. **Mantras:** Simple, repeatable phrases work best under extreme fatigue when complex thought breaks down. Examples used by competitors:
   - "Smooth is fast"
   - "One more"
   - "This is what I trained for"
   - "I don't stop"

## Original Prompt

```
You are a research analyst building a knowledge base for an AI-powered Hyrox coach.

Your task is to produce a comprehensive reference document covering TWO topics:

## 1. Pacing Strategy for Hyrox

- Optimal pacing for the 1km run segments:
  - Should athletes negative split, even split, or positive split?
  - How does pacing change across the 8 runs (early runs vs late runs)?
  - What pace per km should athletes target based on their goal finish time? Present as a table:
    Goal Time | Target Run Pace | Avg Station Time Budget
- Heart rate zone management across the entire race:
  - What HR zones should athletes target during runs vs stations vs transitions?
  - How does HR drift affect pacing decisions in the second half?
  - What HR ceiling should athletes avoid exceeding early in the race?
- Station-specific pacing:
  - SkiErg: target pace per 500m, stroke rate
  - Sled Push: continuous vs stop-and-go strategy, rest between lengths
  - Sled Pull: hand-over-hand technique pacing
  - Burpee Broad Jumps: rep tempo, when to slow down vs push
  - Rowing: target pace per 500m, stroke rate
  - Farmers Carry: walk pace, grip management, when to set down
  - Sandbag Lunges: step tempo, breathing pattern
  - Wall Balls: rep tempo, break strategy (unbroken vs sets)
- When to push vs conserve: which stations reward aggressive pacing vs steady pacing

## 2. Common Mistakes & Race Execution

- Most common training mistakes in Hyrox preparation:
  - Neglecting running volume
  - Over-focusing on strength at expense of endurance
  - Not practicing transitions
  - Not doing full simulations
- Most common race-day execution errors:
  - Going out too fast on run 1
  - Poor sled technique wasting energy
  - Not having a wall ball break strategy
  - Ignoring nutrition/hydration
- Race-day nutrition and hydration:
  - Pre-race meal timing and composition
  - During-race fueling (gels, hydration, electrolytes)
  - What to consume at water stations
- Warm-up protocols:
  - Timing (how long before wave start)
  - Specific movements and activation drills
  - Mental preparation routine
- Mental models used by top competitors:
  - "Station + next run = one unit" mindset
  - Process goals vs outcome goals
  - Self-talk strategies
  - Managing the pain cave in runs 5-8

IMPORTANT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Length: At minimum 3,000 words. Be exhaustive with tactical details.
- Format: Use structured markdown with H2/H3 headers and markdown tables for pacing targets.
- Be specific: Include actual paces, HR zones, rep tempos, nutrition quantities.
- Cite sources inline when referencing specific coaches, athletes, or studies.
- Write in natural language that matches coaching queries like "how should I pace my sled push" or "what should I eat before Hyrox."
```
