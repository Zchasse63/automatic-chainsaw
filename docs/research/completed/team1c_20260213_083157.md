# HYROX Workout Stations: Complete Tactical Breakdown for AI Coach Knowledge Base

> **Purpose:** This document serves as the definitive tactical reference for an AI-powered Hyrox coach. It covers optimal technique, common mistakes, target times, muscle group impact, and training progressions for all eight workout stations. Data is sourced from Hyrox race analytics (700,000+ results via HyroxDataLab), coaching platforms (Rox Lyfe, TheProgrm, Hybrid Athlete Club, OnlyGains.ai), Centr (official Hyrox equipment provider), and elite athlete insights.

## Station 1: SkiErg (1000m)

The SkiErg is the first functional station you encounter after your opening 1km run. It sets the tone for the entire race. Because it's Station 1, many athletes make the critical error of going out too hard—burning through glycogen and spiking heart rate before seven more stations and seven more 1km runs remain.

### Optimal Technique

The SkiErg stroke consists of two phases: **the pull** and **the recovery**.

**The Pull Phase:**
- **Initiate with your lats**, not your arms. Think about pulling your elbows down toward your hips rather than yanking the handles with your biceps (OnlyGains.ai).
- Simultaneously **hinge at the hips**, driving your weight slightly back. The hip hinge generates the majority of your power—your arms are merely transmitting force.
- Pull the handles down past your thighs in a smooth arc.
- Keep your core braced throughout to maintain power transfer from upper body to handles.

**The Recovery Phase:**
- Allow arms to rise naturally with the handles.
- Return to a standing position with controlled momentum.
- Don't rush—let the flywheel do some work on the return.
- Reset at the top before initiating the next stroke.

**Breathing Rhythm:**
Adopt one breath cycle per stroke. Exhale forcefully on the pull (as you hinge down), inhale on the recovery (as you stand back up). Establish this pattern within the first 10 strokes and maintain it throughout. Holding your breath is one of the fastest ways to spike heart rate unnecessarily (OnlyGains.ai).

**Stroke Rate:**
Target approximately **30–35 strokes per minute** at race pace. Long, powerful strokes beat short, frantic ones. Quality over quantity—each stroke should feel like a controlled, powerful movement rather than rapid arm-flailing.

### Common Efficiency Mistakes and How to Fix Them

1. **Arms-first pulling:** Athletes yank the handles with biceps/shoulders instead of engaging lats and hip hinge. **Fix:** Cue "elbows to hips" and think of a deadlift motion. The arms connect; the hips power.

2. **Starting too fast:** Sprinting the first 200m at max effort and dying by 500m. **Fix:** Remember this is Station 1 of 8. Start at 70–75% effort and build. Target a negative split—faster second half than first (OnlyGains.ai).

3. **Standing too tall:** Not hinging at the hips, losing power from the core and posterior chain. **Fix:** Exaggerate the hip hinge. Your torso should reach roughly 45° of forward lean at the bottom of each stroke.

4. **Choppy, short strokes:** Rapid abbreviated pulls generating minimal power per stroke. **Fix:** Slow down, extend the range of motion, and aim for 30–35 SPM, not 45+.

5. **Holding your breath:** Causes early fatigue and heart rate spikes. **Fix:** Conscious, rhythmic breathing—one breath cycle per stroke, established in the first few reps.

### Target Times by Performance Level

| Level | 1000m Time (Isolated) | Pace/500m | In-Race Estimate (+10–20%) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Elite (Pro Division) | Under 3:00 | Under 1:30 | 3:30–4:20 |
| Advanced | 3:00–3:30 | 1:30–1:45 | 3:30–4:15 |
| Intermediate | 3:30–4:15 | 1:45–2:07 | 4:15–5:00 |
| Beginner | 4:15–5:00 | 2:07–2:30 | 5:00–6:00 |
| First-Timer | 5:00+ | 2:30+ | 6:00+ |

*Data from OnlyGains.ai and competitive.fit. Elite male race averages: ~4:25; average male HYROX finisher: ~6:19 (competitive.fit). Elite Pro men have recorded sub-3:50 in race conditions. Rox Lyfe elite Pro data shows median of 3:47 for top-15 men.*

### Pacing Strategy

- **0–300m (70–75% effort):** Let heart rate settle from the run. Splits around 1:55–2:05/500m.
- **300–700m (80–85% effort):** Find sustainable race rhythm. Splits around 1:50–2:00/500m.
- **700–1000m (90%+ effort):** Push knowing you're finishing soon. Splits around 1:45–1:55/500m.

Don't stare at the monitor constantly—check every 250m (OnlyGains.ai).

### Muscle Groups Taxed and Impact on Subsequent Run

**Primary:** Latissimus dorsi, posterior deltoids, triceps, core (rectus abdominis, obliques), hip extensors (glutes, hamstrings).
**Secondary:** Forearm flexors (grip on handles), erector spinae.

**Carryover to Run 2:** The SkiErg primarily taxes the upper body and core, with moderate hip flexor/extensor fatigue from the hinge pattern. Most athletes find their legs relatively fresh for Run 2, but their heart rate and breathing can be elevated. The key is managing effort so cardiovascular stress doesn't tank your second run pace.

### Training Benchmarks and Drills

- **Pacing Practice:** 4 × 500m SkiErg, 2 min rest. Goal: hit the same split (within 3 sec) on all four rounds.
- **Race Simulation:** 1km run → 1000m SkiErg → 1km run. Track transition times.
- **Endurance Builder:** 2000m SkiErg at conversational pace, every 500m do 10 push-ups.
- **Interval Power:** 8 × 250m SkiErg, 1:1 work:rest, build speed each round (OnlyGains.ai).

## Station 2: Sled Push (4 × 12.5m = 50m Total)

The sled push is the first truly heavy strength station. Weights are significant: **Women Open 102kg, Men Open/Women Pro 152kg, Men Pro 202kg** (all including sled weight). The Hyrox competition carpet creates substantially more friction than typical gym floors, meaning the sled feels heavier than athletes expect. This station has one of the highest time variabilities and can easily cost several minutes if technique is poor.

### Optimal Body Angle, Arm Position, Foot Placement, and Driving Technique

**Body Angle:** Achieve a **45-degree lean** with hips below shoulders. This creates a horizontal force vector, pushing the sled forward rather than down into the carpet. When you stand too tall, gravity works against you—you push down into the floor, creating more friction (HyroxTrainingPlans.com).

**Arm Position:** Elbows bent at **90–120 degrees**. Arms act as connectors, not pushers. Your legs generate 4× more power than your shoulders. Straight, locked-out arms force deltoids and triceps to engage heavily—they fatigue fast. Bent arms transmit leg power to the sled (HyroxTrainingPlans.com).

**Hand Position:** Hands shoulder-width apart, firm grip but not a death grip (save forearm energy for sled pull and later stations).

**Foot Placement:** Take **rapid 6–8 inch steps** maintaining 120+ steps per minute cadence. Long strides create a stop-start pattern—you decelerate between steps. Short, rapid steps maintain constant forward pressure (HyroxTrainingPlans.com).

**Starting Position:** Set your position BEFORE the first push—already at 45° angle, hands placed, core braced. The first 3 steps are the hardest (breaking static friction). Starting from standing wastes the crucial first push.

**Head Position:** Neutral, eyes 6 feet ahead on the ground. Don't look up—it pulls you into an upright position.

### Continuous Push vs. Reset Between Lengths

The 50m is split into 4 × 12.5m legs with turns. At the turn, you must reposition. **Elite athletes minimize time at turns** by maintaining sled contact and immediately resetting body angle. The sled stops at each turn regardless, so the key is minimizing the time between the sled stopping and your next push beginning. Pre-set your body angle before driving again. Don't stand up fully at the turns—stay low, reposition your feet, and go.

### Common Mistakes

1. **Standing too upright:** Pushes force downward into carpet instead of horizontally. **Fix:** 45-degree lean, hips below shoulders.
2. **Locked arms / pushing from shoulders:** Treats the sled like a bench press. **Fix:** Bend elbows 90–120°, let legs drive.
3. **Long strides:** Creates stop-start pattern, losing momentum. **Fix:** Short, rapid 6–8 inch steps.
4. **Not using legs:** Upper body pushing instead of leg driving. **Fix:** Think "sprinter stance"—power comes from quads, glutes, and calves.
5. **Grip too tight:** Burns forearms needed for sled pull. **Fix:** Firm but relaxed grip—the sled isn't going anywhere.
6. **Wrong starting position:** Standing then leaning in. **Fix:** Set 45° position before first push.

### Target Times by Performance Level

| Level | Men (152kg) | Women (102kg) |
|---|---|---|
| Elite | 2:30–3:00 | 2:30–3:00 |
| Advanced | 3:00–3:30 | 3:00–3:25 |
| Intermediate | 3:30–4:30 | 3:30–4:30 |
| Beginner/Recreational | 4:30–6:00+ | 4:30–6:00+ |

*Elite data from HyroxDataLab: men 2:50–3:26, women 2:50–3:25. Rox Lyfe Pro elite median: men 2:45, women 3:00. Average HYROX finisher: men ~3:54, women ~4:13 (competitive.fit).*

### Muscle Groups Taxed and Carryover to Next Run

**Primary:** Quadriceps, glutes, calves, core (anti-extension).
**Secondary:** Deltoids, triceps, erector spinae.

**Carryover to Run 3:** The sled push is heavily quad-dominant. Athletes often experience significant quad burn and elevated heart rate entering Run 3. The first 200–400m of the subsequent run typically feels sluggish. Training "compromised running" (running immediately after sled work) is critical. Expect Run 3 pace to be 10–20 seconds/km slower than Run 1.

### Training Progressions

- **Weeks 1–2 (Technique Focus):** 50% race weight, 4–5 sets of 25m, 2 min rest. Focus on body angle + arm position.
- **Weeks 3–4 (Progressive Load):** 70–100% race weight, 4–5 sets of 25m. Combine multiple technique cues.
- **Weeks 5–8 (Race Specificity):** Full race weight, 4 × 12.5m (race format). Add 500m run before each set.
- **Speed Work:** Lighter weight (60%), focus on maximizing step cadence.
- **Overload:** 110–120% race weight for shorter distances (2 × 12.5m) to build strength reserve.

*Note: Gym floors are almost always smoother than Hyrox carpet. Add 20–35kg to match race-day feel (Rox Lyfe recommendation).*

---

## Station 3: Sled Pull (4 × 12.5m = 50m Total)

The sled pull is one of the most time-variable stations in Hyrox and the area where average athletes lose the most time relative to elites. Rox Lyfe data shows **elite Pro men at ~3:14 median vs. average Pro men at 6:31—a 3:17 gap**, the largest of any station. Weights: **Women Open 78kg, Men Open/Women Pro 103kg, Men Pro 153kg** (including sled).

### Hand-Over-Hand Technique vs. Hip Extension vs. Walk-Back

Three primary techniques exist (TheProgrm, Hybrid Athlete Club):

1. **Hand-Over-Hand (Arms Only):** Stand relatively upright, pull the rope hand over hand using biceps and back. Short, choppy pulls keep the sled moving. Best for athletes with **strong upper bodies** but can fatigue arms quickly. More suited to lighter sled weights (Open Women).

2. **Hip Extension Method:** Grab the rope with arms nearly fully extended, then explosively extend hips (like a kettlebell swing/deadlift) while pulling through with arms. The hip extension creates inertia that the arms can then finish. **Most efficient for heavier weights** as it recruits the entire posterior chain. This is the preferred technique for most competitive athletes.

3. **Walk-Back Method:** Hold the rope and physically walk backward in the small ~1.8m athlete box, using body weight and leg drive. Effective but space-limited—you can only take 2–3 steps before hitting the boundary line.

4. **Combination (Recommended for most):** Initiate with hip extension, finish with arm pull, and incorporate small backward steps. This distributes work across the most muscle groups and is the most sustainable over 50m.

### Rope Management and Grip Strategies

- **Take the slack out first:** The Hyrox rope is the full 12.5m length and has slight elasticity. Before your first pull, grab and tension the rope so the first real pull moves the sled immediately (Hybrid Athlete Club).
- **Manage rope pile:** As you pull, rope accumulates behind/around you. Be deliberate about where it falls to avoid tripping—a common race-day disaster (Rox Lyfe).
- **Grip:** Use a firm but not death-grip hold. Chalk is permitted and strongly recommended. Alternate which hand leads if using hand-over-hand to distribute fatigue.
- **Stay in your box:** Athletes must not step on the solid white line at the end of the athlete's box—penalties apply.

### Common Mistakes and Fixes

1. **Long, sweeping arm pulls:** Wastes energy and creates a stop-start pattern. **Fix:** Short, quick, choppy pulls to maintain sled momentum.
2. **Not using hips/legs:** Pulling purely with arms. **Fix:** Lean back and drive hips, using body weight as leverage.
3. **Tripping on rope:** Rope piles behind feet. **Fix:** Practice rope management; step to the side of the pile, not on it.
4. **Letting sled stop between pulls:** Static friction is much greater than kinetic friction. **Fix:** Keep pulls rapid enough that the sled never fully stops.
5. **Underestimating the friction:** The Hyrox carpet makes sleds feel dramatically heavier than gym training. **Fix:** Train with added weight to simulate race-day friction (Rox Lyfe suggests +35kg on typical gym floors).

### Target Times by Performance Level

| Level | Men (103kg Open / 153kg Pro) | Women (78kg Open / 103kg Pro) |
|---|---|---|
| Elite | 3:00–3:50 | 3:30–4:15 |
| Advanced | 3:50–4:45 | 4:15–5:00 |
| Intermediate | 4:45–6:00 | 5:00–7:00 |
| Beginner/Recreational | 6:00–8:00+ | 7:00–9:00+ |

*HyroxDataLab elite: men 3:50–4:37, women 4:15–4:59. Average HYROX finisher: men ~6:12, women ~7:03 (competitive.fit). Rox Lyfe Pro elite median: men 3:14, women 3:54.*

### Muscle Groups Taxed and Carryover to Next Run

**Primary:** Biceps, forearm flexors (grip), latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, posterior deltoids, glutes, hamstrings (hip extension), erector spinae.
**Secondary:** Quadriceps (walk-back method), core (anti-flexion).

**Carryover to Run 4:** The sled pull hammers grip, biceps, and posterior chain. Forearm fatigue begins accumulating here and won't fully recover before farmers carry (Station 6). The posterior chain work can make the subsequent run feel surprisingly okay for the legs, but upper body tightness and elevated heart rate are common. The grip fatigue created here has a long tail effect across the remaining race.

## Station 4: Burpee Broad Jumps (80m)

This is widely regarded as **the most systemically fatiguing station** in Hyrox. It combines a full chest-to-ground burpee with a forward broad jump, repeated over 80 meters. Most athletes need **40–60 reps** to cover the distance, depending on jump length. It comes after 4km of running and three strength stations, and the physiological demand is enormous—full-body muscular work combined with repeated impact and cardiovascular stress.

### Optimal Technique

**The Burpee Portion:**
- Chest MUST touch the ground. Hands must be placed no more than 30cm in front of feet.
- **Step-up method (recommended):** Step one leg up at a time after the chest-to-ground position. This is what most top athletes use because it conserves energy and keeps heart rate lower. Hyrox coach Meg Jacobi confirms: *"Use the step-up method to conserve energy and keep your heart rate lower. Maintaining steady movement with fewer breaks will yield a better time overall"* (Centr).
- **Jump-up method:** Both feet jump forward simultaneously. Faster per rep, but dramatically spikes heart rate and is unsustainable for most over 80m.
- Feet must be parallel on takeoff and landing—no staggered takeoffs.

**The Broad Jump Portion:**
- Jump **forward**, not up. Vertical height is wasted energy that doesn't count toward the 80m.
- Moderate jump distance (1.3–2.0m per rep) is more sustainable than maximum-effort jumps. If your max broad jump is 2.5m, aim for 1.5–1.8m per rep. This conserves leg power dramatically.
- Land softly with bent knees to absorb impact and reduce cumulative joint stress.

**Efficiency of Movement:**
- Minimize the transition between landing and going down for the next burpee. The faster you establish a rhythm (land → hands down → chest down → step up → jump), the better.
- No forward steps between reps are allowed.

### Pacing Strategy

**Steady tempo is king.** Rox Lyfe, Centr, and virtually every experienced Hyrox coach emphasize consistent pacing over a push-and-rest strategy. Going fast for 20m then resting 30 seconds is far worse than maintaining a sustainable rhythm throughout.

- **Know your rep count:** Before race day, measure how many BBJs it takes you to cover 80m. If it takes 50 reps, break it into mental chunks (5 groups of 10, or 10 groups of 5).
- **RPE target:** 7–8/10. You should feel like you're working hard but could sustain the pace for the full distance.
- **If you must rest:** Rest lying chest-down on the floor, not standing. Heart rate lowers faster when lying down (Rox Lyfe). Short 5–10 second rests are better than one long 30-second break.

### Common Mistakes

1. **Jumping too high (not forward):** Wastes energy without gaining distance. **Fix:** Think "long jump" not "high jump." Focus on forward distance.
2. **Inefficient get-ups:** Struggling to stand from chest-to-ground. **Fix:** Practice the step-up: plant one foot close to your hands, drive up with that leg.
3. **Starting too fast:** Going all-out for the first 20m, then crashing. **Fix:** Set a metronome-like rhythm from rep 1. Aim for the same effort on rep 1 and rep 50.
4. **Too-long jumps:** Max-effort jumps fatigue quads and spike heart rate. **Fix:** Use 60–70% of your max jump distance.
5. **Hands too far from feet:** Placing hands far forward before the burpee wastes distance and energy. **Fix:** Hands placed no more than 30cm in front of feet (this is also the rule).

### Target Times by Performance Level

| Level | Men | Women |
|---|---|---|
| Elite (Pro) | 2:21–4:00 | 3:11–5:15 |
| Advanced | 4:00–5:00 | 5:00–6:00 |
| Intermediate | 5:00–6:30 | 6:00–7:30 |
| Beginner/Recreational | 6:30–9:00+ | 7:30–10:00+ |

*HyroxDataLab elite: men 4:00–4:37, women 5:15–5:57. Average HYROX finisher: ~5:23 for both genders (competitive.fit). Rox Lyfe Pro elite median: men 2:21, women 3:11—note these are the absolute best in the world. 2026 average Men's Open: 5:45, Women's Open: 7:09 (hyroxy.com/TheRoxZone data).*

### Muscle Groups Taxed

**Primary:** Quadriceps (jumping, standing), chest/pectorals (lowering to ground), hip flexors, glutes, hamstrings.
**Secondary:** Triceps (push-up portion), shoulders, core (stabilization), calves.
**Systemic:** This is the station that creates the highest cardiovascular demand. Heart rate will reach near-maximal levels. It taxes both the aerobic and anaerobic systems heavily.

**Carryover to Run 5:** Run 5 (after BBJ) is often the slowest run of the race. Legs are heavy from jumping, heart rate is elevated, and there's a psychological weight of knowing you're only halfway through. Elite athletes manage compromised running here; recreational athletes often walk portions of Run 5. Training compromised running after BBJ sets is essential.

---

## Station 5: Rowing (1000m)

The rowing station is the **only station where you sit down** in the entire Hyrox race. It comes at the race's midpoint—after five 1km runs and four functional stations. Smart athletes treat it as tactical recovery. Foolish athletes either waste it by going too easy (5+ minutes) or blow up by sprinting it and imploding during the farmer's carry. The Concept2 RowErg is the machine used at all events.

### Optimal Technique: Drive Sequence, Stroke Rate, Damper Setting

**The Drive Sequence (Power Phase):**
The rowing stroke is **85% legs, 10% core, 5% arms** (OnlyGains.ai). The sequence is always: **Legs → Back → Arms.**

1. **The Catch (start):** Shins vertical, knees bent, arms extended, shoulders forward, core engaged, back straight.
2. **Leg drive:** Push with your legs FIRST. The handle doesn't move until your legs extend.
3. **Back swing:** Once legs are almost straight, lean back slightly (to 1 o'clock position).
4. **Arm pull:** Pull handle to lower chest as the final motion.

**The Recovery (Return):**
Reverse sequence: **Arms → Back → Legs.**
- Arms extend first, body rocks forward, then legs bend last as you slide back.
- Recovery should take **twice as long as the drive**. This is your micro-rest.

**Stroke Rate:** Target **24–28 strokes per minute**. Below 22 SPM you're leaving time on the table; above 32 SPM you're likely getting sloppy and wasting energy. Stronger/more powerful athletes can use a lower stroke rate with more power per stroke; more aerobic athletes may prefer 26–28 SPM (Rox Lyfe).

**Damper Setting:** The damper is preset by division: Women = 5, Women Pro/Men = 6, Men Pro = 7. Athletes can adjust. **Optimal range is 4–6 for most athletes.** The damper controls airflow to the flywheel, not "resistance" in the traditional sense. Higher settings fatigue muscles faster without improving speed. Recommended drag factors: ~130–135 for women, ~145 for men/women pro, ~165 for men pro (John Steventon via Rox Lyfe). Set your drag factor in training to match race conditions.

### Pacing: Even Split vs. Negative Split

**Negative split is the gold standard.** Start conservative, finish fast.

| Strategy | 0–250m | 250–500m | 500–750m | 750–1000m | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Conservative ("Recovery") | 2:05–2:10 | 2:05–2:10 | 2:00–2:05 | 1:55–2:00 | ~4:00–4:15 |
| Steady State ("Time Saver") | 1:55–2:00 | 1:50–1:55 | 1:50–1:55 | 1:45–1:50 | ~3:40–3:50 |
| Aggressive ("Send It") | 1:45–1:50 | 1:42–1:47 | 1:42–1:47 | 1:40–1:45 | ~3:20–3:30 |

*Pacing data from OnlyGains.ai.*

**Rox Lyfe's wisdom:** Going 15–20 seconds slower than your absolute max 1000m row saves enormous energy and "costs" only seconds in context of a 75–100 minute race—but likely saves minutes on subsequent stations.

**Hyrox-specific consideration:** Because your legs are heavily fatigued by Station 5 and you still need them for farmers carry, sandbag lunges, and wall balls, some athletes intentionally bias slightly more toward upper body pulling and less extreme leg drive than a pure rower would. This preserves quad/glute capacity for the race's second half (Rox Lyfe).

### Common Mistakes

1. **Pulling with arms first:** Loses the most powerful part of the stroke (legs). **Fix:** Cue "Legs. Back. Arms." Say it out loud during training.
2. **Damper too high:** Setting to 10 thinking it's harder = faster. **Fix:** Use 4–6. It's not a resistance dial.
3. **Rushing the recovery:** Sliding forward at the same speed as the drive. **Fix:** 2:1 recovery-to-drive ratio. Slow slide forward, explosive drive back.
4. **Hunching forward:** Rounds back at the catch, straining lower back. **Fix:** Chest proud, engage lats.
5. **Death grip on handle:** Fries already-fatigued forearms. **Fix:** Loose hook grip—fingers over handle, relaxed.
6. **Pulling to chin:** Handle finishes at neck level. **Fix:** Handle to lower chest/upper stomach. Elbows pull back, not up.

### Target Times by Performance Level

| Level | 1000m Time (Isolated) | Pace/500m | In-Race Estimate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Elite | Under 3:10 | Under 1:35 | 3:30–4:33 |
| Advanced | 3:10–3:40 | 1:35–1:50 | 3:40–4:15 |
| Intermediate | 3:40–4:15 | 1:50–2:07 | 4:15–5:00 |
| Beginner | 4:15–5:00 | 2:07–2:30 | 5:00–6:00 |

*HyroxDataLab elite: men 4:00–4:33, women 4:45–5:11. Average HYROX finisher: men ~6:30, women ~7:06 (competitive.fit). Rox Lyfe elite Pro median: men 3:58, women 4:29.*

### Muscle Groups Taxed and Carryover to Next Run

**Primary:** Quadriceps (leg drive), glutes (hip extension), latissimus dorsi (pull), hamstrings.
**Secondary:** Biceps, forearms, core, erector spinae, calves.

**Carryover to Run 6:** The row, when paced correctly, should **lower** your heart rate relative to the burpee broad jumps. Run 6 can actually feel relatively good if you used the row strategically. However, if you over-row, quads and grip will be compromised heading into the farmer's carry.

### Training Drills

- **Pacing Practice:** 4 × 500m, 2 min rest. Negative split each piece AND the overall set.
- **Stroke Rate Cap:** 5 × 500m at 22 SPM cap. Forces leg drive efficiency.
- **Race Simulation:** 1km run → 80m BBJ → 1km run → 1000m row → 1km run → 200m farmer's carry.
- **Endurance:** 3000m row, every 500m get off for 10 push-ups. Maintain consistent split despite interruptions (OnlyGains.ai).

---

## Station 6: Farmers Carry (200m)

The farmers carry is the most deceptive station in Hyrox. It looks simple—pick up two kettlebells and walk 200 meters. But after six runs and five brutal stations, it becomes a test of grip endurance, postural integrity, and mental toughness. Weights: **Women Open 2×16kg, Men Open/Women Pro 2×24kg, Men Pro 2×32kg.** You may put the kettlebells down without penalty, but every drop costs time.

### Grip Strategies

**Chalk:** Use it. It's permitted and makes a significant difference, especially if your hands are sweaty from previous stations.

**Hook grip:** Some athletes use a hook-style grip (thumb wrapped under fingers) for added security. Test this in training—it can be uncomfortable but reduces the chance of the kettlebell slipping.

**Forearm endurance:** Grip is important but, according to Dr. Adam Storey (HYROX Sports Science Advisory Council member, via Rox Lyfe podcast), the farmer's carry is better classified as a **"postural endurance test."** When athletes start failing, it's usually the upper back and shoulders that collapse first, not the hands. Once posture goes, grip fatigue accelerates because the kettlebells hang in a mechanically disadvantaged position.

**Training grip specifically:** Dead hangs, heavy holds, farmer's carries at heavier-than-race weight over shorter distances (60–80m), and pull-ups all build grip capacity.

### Walking Pace and Stride Length Optimization

- **Walk as fast as possible.** Rox Lyfe's recommendation: complete this station as quickly as you possibly can. The longer you hold the kettlebells, the more they tax you. A 90-second carry is dramatically less fatiguing than a 3-minute carry—it's not linear.
- **Stride length:** Moderate, brisk strides—not running, but aggressive walking. Overly long strides can create trunk sway that wastes energy.
- **Posture:** Shoulders retracted, chest up, tall spine. Think "military posture." The trap complex (upper/mid/lower traps) stabilizes the shoulders under load. If scapular control is lost and shoulders drift forward, the kettlebells feel heavier and grip fatigue accelerates (Dr. Adam Storey, Rox Lyfe podcast).

### When to Set Down vs. Push Through

- **Elite strategy:** Complete 200m unbroken. Period.
- **Competitive strategy:** One planned rest at 100m if needed. Set down for no more than 5–10 seconds—shake hands, reset grip, go.
- **Recreational strategy:** Rest every 50–75m. Use the "traffic light" approach—when grip feels like it's about to fail (yellow light), set down immediately BEFORE you drop them (red light). Picking up from a drop is harder than a planned set-down.
- **Key insight:** Short, frequent rests beat pushing to failure and needing a long recovery. If you carry for 150m then drop with fried forearms, you might need 20–30 seconds to recover. Two brief 5-second pauses at 75m and 150m would have been faster overall.

### Common Mistakes

1. **Rushing and dropping:** Going too fast, losing grip, then needing extended recovery. **Fix:** Find a fast but sustainable pace with planned rest points.
2. **Poor posture:** Shoulders rounded, upper back collapsed, trunk swaying. **Fix:** Retract shoulder blades, brace core, stand tall. Train upper back strength (barbell rows, shrugs, RDLs).
3. **Death grip from the start:** Squeezing maximally from meter 1. **Fix:** Firm but not maximum grip—gradually increase squeeze as fatigue builds.
4. **Looking down:** Drops chest and encourages shoulder rounding. **Fix:** Eyes forward, chin level.

### Target Times by Performance Level

| Level | Men (2×24kg / 2×32kg Pro) | Women (2×16kg / 2×24kg Pro) |
|---|---|---|
| Elite | 1:10–1:45 | 1:20–2:00 |
| Advanced | 1:45–2:10 | 2:00–2:15 |
| Intermediate | 2:10–2:45 | 2:15–3:00 |
| Beginner/Recreational | 2:45–4:00+ | 3:00–4:30+ |

*Rox Lyfe targets: elite men ~1:10–1:30, elite women ~1:20–1:40, competitive age-groupers 1:30–2:30. Over 3 minutes = needs work. HyroxDataLab elite: men 1:45–1:59, women 2:00–2:15. Average HYROX finisher: men ~2:34, women ~2:49 (competitive.fit). Rox Lyfe elite Pro median: men 1:37, women 1:57.*

### How Grip Fatigue Affects Remaining Stations

This is a critical strategic consideration. After the farmer's carry, you still face:
- **Sandbag Lunges (Station 7):** Holding a 10–30kg sandbag on your shoulders. Dropping the sandbag incurs a **5-second penalty** on the first drop and **disqualification** on the second. Fatigued forearms/grip from the carry can make holding the sandbag brutal.
- **Wall Balls (Station 8):** Holding and throwing a 4–9kg ball 100 times. Shoulder and forearm fatigue from the carry directly impacts wall ball performance.

**Implication:** Don't over-grip the farmer's carry at the expense of the final two stations. Manage grip fatigue as a resource across Stations 6, 7, and 8.

---

## Station 7: Sandbag Lunges (100m)

Sandbag lunges are the seventh station and come brutally late in the race—after 7km of running and six functional stations. Weights: **Women Open 10kg, Men Open/Women Pro 20kg, Men Pro 30kg.** The sandbag must remain on both shoulders at ALL times. Dropping the bag incurs a 5-second penalty; a second drop results in **disqualification.** This station shows one of the **highest time variabilities** of any station—HyroxDataLab found 87–88 seconds of variance between athletes in the same finish-time bracket, making it a high-leverage training target.

### Front-Loaded vs. Shoulder-Carry Position

The sandbag is positioned **across both shoulders** (a yoke-style carry). Key positioning:
- **HIGH on traps, NOT low on shoulders.** Position the sandbag securely on the upper trapezius muscles, almost behind the neck.
- Grip the bag firmly with both hands/forearms to prevent sliding.
- Maintain a tall, upright torso. If your trunk collapses under the sandbag, every step costs more metabolically (Rox Lyfe).
- Some athletes prefer a more "front rack" style hold—sandbag resting on upper chest and anterior deltoids. This shifts load to the quads more but can be easier to manage the bag. Experiment in training.

The HyroxDataLab analysis recommends positioning the bag to enable a more **posterior chain–dominant lunge** (longer steps, slight forward lean) rather than a quad-dominant pattern (short steps, very upright torso). This preserves quadriceps for wall balls.

### Step Length and Tempo Optimization

**The Sweet Spot: 0.9–1.1m steps (HyroxDataLab data analysis):**
- **Men (targeting 1:30 finish):** 100–110 total steps, step length 0.9–1.0m, expected time 4:30–5:30.
- **Women (targeting 1:30 finish):** 110–120 total steps, step length 0.85–0.95m, expected time 4:00–5:00.

**Why not shorter steps?** Short steps (0.7m, ~140 total steps) are quad-dominant and destroy your quads before wall balls. HyroxDataLab found a **r = 0.738 correlation** between lunge technique and wall ball performance—athletes who went quad-dominant on lunges averaged 75 seconds slower on wall balls.

**Why not longer steps?** Excessively long steps (>1.2m) create balance issues, slow tempo, and increase injury risk on fatigued legs.

**Tempo:** Aim for continuous "touch-and-go" lunges—rear knee touches ground, immediately drive up into the next step. Avoid pausing in the standing position between reps. Set a metronome-like rhythm within the first 3 steps and maintain it.

### Breathing Pattern During Lunges

- **Inhale** as you lower into the lunge (eccentric phase).
- **Exhale** as you drive up (concentric phase).
- Alternatively, some athletes prefer exhaling at the bottom of the lunge to engage core bracing, then inhaling during the transition. Test both approaches in training.
- The key is consistency—irregular breathing under a loaded sandbag creates core instability and wastes energy.

### Common Mistakes

1. **Too-long steps:** Causes balance issues and slows tempo. **Fix:** Target 0.9–1.1m per step.
2. **Losing balance / lateral drift:** Lunging offline wastes distance. **Fix:** Maintain a ~30cm foot-width between left and right feet (not lunging on a tightrope). Follow the centerline of the lane.
3. **Poor posture / folding forward:** Trunk collapses under sandbag, increasing metabolic cost. **Fix:** Chest up, squeeze shoulder blades, strong upper back. Train front rack holds and Zercher carries.
4. **Dropping the sandbag:** First drop = 5-second penalty. Second drop = DQ. **Fix:** Secure grip before starting; train holding the bag under fatigue. Forearm endurance from farmer's carry training pays dividends here.
5. **Quad-dominant lunges (short steps, very upright):** Destroys quads before wall balls. **Fix:** Slightly longer steps with controlled forward lean to recruit glutes/hamstrings.
6. **Resting between reps in standing position:** Standing pauses add up significantly over 100m. **Fix:** Touch-and-go rhythm—knee touches, immediately drive into next step.

### Target Times by Performance Level

| Level | Men (20kg / 30kg Pro) | Women (10kg / 20kg Pro) |
|---|---|---|
| Elite | 3:00–4:00 | 3:30–4:30 |
| Advanced | 4:00–4:45 | 4:00–4:30 |
| Intermediate | 4:45–6:00 | 4:30–5:30 |
| Beginner/Recreational | 6:00–8:00+ | 5:30–7:00+ |

*HyroxDataLab elite: men 3:50–4:24, women 4:00–4:30. HyroxDataLab median for 1:27–1:33 finishers: men 5:18, women 4:39. Average HYROX finisher: men ~5:35, women ~5:27 (competitive.fit). Rox Lyfe Pro elite median: men 3:03, women 3:35.*

### Quad and Glute Fatigue Management Heading into Wall Balls

The lunge-to-wall-ball connection is the most important inter-station relationship in the second half of Hyrox. HyroxDataLab's analysis found:
- Athletes using **posterior chain–dominant lunges** (longer steps, glute/hamstring emphasis) performed wall balls an average of **75 seconds faster** than athletes who used short, quad-dominant steps.
- **Practical example:** Athlete A: 140 short steps (0.7m) → quad-dominant → wall balls at 7:30. Athlete B: 100 longer steps (1.0m) → posterior chain emphasis → wall balls at 6:15.

**During Run 8 (after lunges, before wall balls):** Shake out quads during the run. Use dynamic muscle relaxation—consciously relax quad muscles during each stride's swing phase. Mental prep: "My quads are preserved. Wall balls will be hard but I'm ready."

---

## Station 8: Wall Balls (100 Reps — All Divisions)

The final station. The last obstacle between you and the finish line. 100 reps of wall balls—a full-depth squat into an explosive overhead throw—after 8km of running and 7 other functional stations. Weights: **Women Open 4kg to 9ft target (2.7m), Women Pro 6kg to 9ft, Men Open 6kg to 10ft target (3m), Men Pro 9kg to 10ft.** This station has one of the largest time variabilities (Rox Lyfe data shows a 3:13 gap between elite and average Pro men) and is where races are won or lost.

### Optimal Technique

**Setup:**
- Stand facing the target with feet **shoulder-width apart** (or slightly wider for a stable base and deeper squat).
- Position yourself approximately **one arm's length from the wall/rig**.
- Hold the ball at chest height with elbows tucked. Thumbs behind/under the ball.
- Eyes on the target to maintain upright posture.

**The Squat:**
- Initiate with a full-depth squat—**hips must descend below knees** (below parallel). A box is placed behind you at most events; the judge checks that you make contact with it each rep. Shallow squats result in **no-reps**, which are devastating at this stage.
- Drive up through heels, extending hips and knees explosively.
- Maintain neutral spine throughout. Don't let the ball pull you forward.
- Widen your stance if needed—a wider stance allows for deeper squats with less ankle mobility demand.

**The Throw:**
- Use the **momentum from your squat drive** to power the throw. The ball should leave your hands as your legs reach full extension.
- Some athletes add a slight **heel raise (calf raise) at the top** for extra power—this is a personal preference that Rox Lyfe recommends testing in training.
- Don't over-throw. Aim for the ball to **just** hit the target. Throwing excessively high wastes arm and shoulder energy.
- Keep the ball **close to your body** throughout. Holding it away from your chest puts extra load on shoulders.

**The Catch and Cycle:**
- Catch the ball on its descent and **immediately begin squatting** as you absorb the ball. Don't catch with straight legs and then start squatting—that's two separate movements instead of one.
- This "catch-and-squat" technique dramatically improves efficiency and cycle time (George Edwards, HYROX coach).
- If the ball falls, you must stand tall with hips and knees extended before starting the next rep—you cannot catch a bounced ball and continue.

### Break Strategy: What's Optimal by Fitness Level

This is one of the most common coaching queries: "How should I break up wall balls?"

**Elite/Unbroken (Target: <5:30):**
- 100 reps unbroken. Requires exceptional fitness and specific training. Only viable for athletes who can complete 100 unbroken reps in training under fatigue.

**Competitive/Large Sets (Target: 5:30–7:00):**
- Sets of 25–25–25–25 with 5–10 second rests. Or 30–30–20–20.
- Rest is brief and **planned before failure**. Set the ball down, shake arms, 3–5 deep breaths, pick up and go.

**Intermediate/Medium Sets (Target: 7:00–9:00):**
- Sets of 15–20 with 10–15 second rests.
- Centr (official Hyrox equipment provider) recommends: **25–15–10–5** descending pattern, staying sharp with form.
- Alternative: Sets of 10 with very short rests (5 seconds). This keeps you moving and avoids the psychological challenge of staring down 25+ reps.

**Beginner/Small Sets (Target: 9:00+):**
- Sets of 10 with 15–20 second rests.
- Or sets of 5 if needed—just keep moving.
- Key principle: **Don't go to failure.** If you can do 15 unbroken, break at 10. Failed reps (ball slipping, no-reps) cost far more time than planned rests.

**Critical insight from Rox Lyfe:** "Many people make the mistake of doing as many as they can at the start, but end up needing to take a lot of rest between sets after that initial blast. Instead, more frequent, but very quick rests, may help your overall time." Start conservatively and finish strong. With race adrenaline, you may find you can push through those final 20 reps without the planned rest.

### Breathing Rhythm and Pacing

- **Breathe in** at the bottom of the squat (this happens somewhat naturally).
- **Breathe out** at the top of the rep as you release the ball.
- One breath per rep is the target rhythm.
- If doing large sets (25+), you may need to add a second breath cycle: inhale on the way down, exhale at the bottom, inhale on the way up, exhale on release. Find what works in training.

**Cadence matters:** The speed at which you drop into the squat and drive back up (your "cycle time") makes an enormous difference over 100 reps. An elite athlete completing each rep in 3 seconds finishes in 5:00. A recreational athlete at 5 seconds per rep (plus rests) takes 9–10 minutes. Practice increasing cadence specifically.

### Common Mistakes

1. **Shallow squats (no-reps):** The single most devastating mistake. Each no-rep costs you the energy of the rep PLUS the rep doesn't count. **Fix:** Practice squat depth obsessively. Use the box touch cue. Go slightly deeper than required to build a margin.
2. **Throwing too high:** Wastes arm and shoulder energy. **Fix:** Aim to just hit the target. Accuracy over power.
3. **Ball too far from body:** Holding the ball away from your chest during the squat. **Fix:** Keep elbows tucked, ball at chest.
4. **Catching with straight legs then squatting:** Two movements instead of one. **Fix:** Begin squatting as you catch—absorb and descend simultaneously.
5. **Taking too long between sets:** Long rests cool the muscles and make restarting harder. **Fix:** Planned, brief rests (5–10 seconds max). Set the ball down, shake arms, pick up.
6. **Ego pacing:** Going for a big unbroken set to start and blowing up. **Fix:** Start with conservative sets and assess how you feel. You can always go bigger on the final set.

### Target Times by Performance Level

| Level | Men (6kg/9kg Pro, 10ft) | Women (4kg/6kg Pro, 9ft) |
|---|---|---|
| Elite | 4:25–5:30 | 3:50–5:20 |
| Advanced | 5:30–6:30 | 5:20–6:00 |
| Intermediate | 6:30–8:00 | 6:00–7:30 |
| Beginner/Recreational | 8:00–10:00+ | 7:30–10:00+ |

*HyroxDataLab elite: men 5:30–6:04, women 5:20–5:53. Average HYROX finisher: men ~7:08, women ~7:20 (competitive.fit). Rox Lyfe Pro elite median: men 4:25, women 3:50.*

### Mentality and Finishing Strategies

**This is the LAST station.** Everything you've saved, everything you've reserved—spend it now.

- **Empty the tank:** Rox Lyfe states: *"By the time you reach the wall balls your tank will likely be almost empty, and you should use the wall balls to fully empty it!"* There's nothing after this except the finish line sprint.
- **Count down, not up:** Mentally, counting from 100 to 0 is more motivating than 0 to 100. "Only 30 left" hits different than "I've done 70."
- **Break it into micro-goals:** Don't think about 100. Think about the next 10. Then the next 10.
- **Crowd energy:** The wall ball station is typically near the finish area and spectators can see you. Feed off that energy in the final 20–30 reps.
- **The final kick:** From about 5 minutes before the finish (roughly the wall ball station for competitive athletes), go into full "race kick" mode. This is where the HYROX version of a "finishing sprint" happens—on wall balls, not on the track.
- **Visualization:** During the row (Station 5) or farmer's carry (Station 6), picture yourself completing your last wall ball rep. Build a mental image of crossing the finish line. This isn't woo-woo coaching; elite athletes consistently report using visualization to manage the final push.

## Original Prompt

```
You are a research analyst building a knowledge base for an AI-powered Hyrox coach.

Your task is to produce a DETAILED tactical breakdown of ALL 8 Hyrox workout stations. For EACH station, cover every subsection thoroughly.

## Station 1: SkiErg (1000m)
- Optimal technique: arm pull pattern, hip hinge, breathing rhythm
- Common efficiency mistakes and how to fix them
- Target times by performance level (elite / competitive / recreational)
- Muscle groups taxed and how they affect the subsequent 1km run
- Training benchmarks and specific drills

## Station 2: Sled Push (4 x 12.5m = 50m total)
- Optimal body angle, arm position, foot placement, driving technique
- Continuous push vs reset between lengths
- Common mistakes: standing too upright, not using legs, grip issues
- Target times by performance level
- Muscle groups taxed and carryover to the next run
- Training progressions (weight overload, speed work)

## Station 3: Sled Pull (4 x 12.5m = 50m total)
- Hand-over-hand technique vs walking backward
- Rope management, grip strategies
- Common mistakes and fixes
- Target times by performance level
- Muscle groups taxed and carryover to the next run

## Station 4: Burpee Broad Jumps (80m)
- Optimal technique: chest-to-ground, jump distance, efficiency of movement
- Pacing strategy: steady tempo vs push-and-rest
- Common mistakes: jumping too high (not forward), inefficient get-ups
- Target times by performance level
- Muscle groups taxed — this is often the most systemically fatiguing station

## Station 5: Rowing (1000m)
- Optimal technique: drive sequence, stroke rate, damper setting
- Pacing: even split vs negative split for 1000m
- Common mistakes: pulling with arms first, setting damper too high
- Target times and paces by performance level
- Muscle groups taxed and carryover to the next run

## Station 6: Farmers Carry (200m)
- Grip strategies: chalk, hook grip, forearm endurance
- Walking pace and stride length optimization
- When to set down and rest vs pushing through
- Common mistakes: rushing and dropping, poor posture
- Target times by performance level
- How grip fatigue affects remaining stations (sandbag lunges, wall balls)

## Station 7: Sandbag Lunges (100m)
- Front-loaded vs shoulder-carry sandbag position
- Step length and tempo optimization
- Breathing pattern during lunges
- Common mistakes: too-long steps, losing balance, poor posture
- Target times by performance level
- Quad and glute fatigue management heading into wall balls

## Station 8: Wall Balls (75-100 reps depending on division)
- Optimal technique: squat depth, ball catch, throw height
- Break strategy: unbroken, sets of 25, sets of 10 — what's optimal by fitness level
- Breathing rhythm and pacing
- Common mistakes: shallow squats (no-reps), throwing too high
- Target times by performance level
- This is the LAST station — mentality and finishing strategies

IMPORTANT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Length: At minimum 4,000 words. This is the most detailed document — cover every station thoroughly.
- Format: Use structured markdown with H2 for each station, H3 for subsections.
- Include a summary table at the end: Station | Elite Time | Competitive Time | Recreational Time | Key Muscle Groups | #1 Mistake
- Be specific: Include actual times, weights, paces, rep schemes, technique cues.
- Cite sources: Reference coaches, athletes, or Hyrox-specific content creators.
- Write in natural language that matches coaching queries like "what is the best technique for sled push" or "how should I break up wall balls."
