You are a research analyst building a knowledge base for an AI-powered Hyrox coach.

Your task is to produce a comprehensive reference document covering TWO topics:

## 1. Pacing Strategy for Hyrox

- Optimal pacing for the 1km run segments:
  - Should athletes negative split, even split, or positive split?
  - How does pacing change across the 8 runs (early runs vs late runs)?
  - What pace per km should athletes target based on their goal finish time? Present as a table:
    Goal Time | Target Run Pace | Avg Station Time Budget
- Heart rate zone management across the entire race:
  - What HR zones should athletes target during runs vs stations vs transitions?
  - How does HR drift affect pacing decisions in the second half?
  - What HR ceiling should athletes avoid exceeding early in the race?
- Station-specific pacing:
  - SkiErg: target pace per 500m, stroke rate
  - Sled Push: continuous vs stop-and-go strategy, rest between lengths
  - Sled Pull: hand-over-hand technique pacing
  - Burpee Broad Jumps: rep tempo, when to slow down vs push
  - Rowing: target pace per 500m, stroke rate
  - Farmers Carry: walk pace, grip management, when to set down
  - Sandbag Lunges: step tempo, breathing pattern
  - Wall Balls: rep tempo, break strategy (unbroken vs sets)
- When to push vs conserve: which stations reward aggressive pacing vs steady pacing

## 2. Common Mistakes & Race Execution

- Most common training mistakes in Hyrox preparation:
  - Neglecting running volume
  - Over-focusing on strength at expense of endurance
  - Not practicing transitions
  - Not doing full simulations
- Most common race-day execution errors:
  - Going out too fast on run 1
  - Poor sled technique wasting energy
  - Not having a wall ball break strategy
  - Ignoring nutrition/hydration
- Race-day nutrition and hydration:
  - Pre-race meal timing and composition
  - During-race fueling (gels, hydration, electrolytes)
  - What to consume at water stations
- Warm-up protocols:
  - Timing (how long before wave start)
  - Specific movements and activation drills
  - Mental preparation routine
- Mental models used by top competitors:
  - "Station + next run = one unit" mindset
  - Process goals vs outcome goals
  - Self-talk strategies
  - Managing the pain cave in runs 5-8

IMPORTANT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Length: At minimum 3,000 words. Be exhaustive with tactical details.
- Format: Use structured markdown with H2/H3 headers and markdown tables for pacing targets.
- Be specific: Include actual paces, HR zones, rep tempos, nutrition quantities.
- Cite sources inline when referencing specific coaches, athletes, or studies.
- Write in natural language that matches coaching queries like "how should I pace my sled push" or "what should I eat before Hyrox."
