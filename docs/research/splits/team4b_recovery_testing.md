## Prompt for Perplexity

```
You are a sports science researcher building a knowledge base for an AI-powered Hyrox coach. A previous research task covered energy systems, aerobic frameworks (Hinshaw, Galpin, Seiler), and concurrent training interference but was INCOMPLETE. Your task is to cover recovery science and testing protocols.

## 1. Recovery & Adaptation Science for Hybrid Athletes

### Sleep
- Optimal sleep duration for athletes training 10-12 hours/week
- Sleep quality metrics that matter (deep sleep, REM, HRV during sleep)
- Impact of poor sleep on training adaptations (what's the research say?)
- Practical sleep hygiene recommendations for athletes

### Active Recovery Protocols
- What to do on rest days (not just "rest")
- Low-intensity movement: walking, swimming, cycling — what intensity, how long?
- Foam rolling / self-myofascial release: what works, what's myth?
- Stretching: static vs dynamic, when to use each, evidence-based recommendations
- Cold water immersion / ice baths: current evidence (help or harm adaptation?)
- Sauna / heat exposure: current evidence for recovery and adaptation

### Mobility Routines for Hyrox Athletes
- Key mobility restrictions that affect Hyrox performance:
  - Thoracic extension (affects SkiErg, wall balls, overhead position)
  - Hip flexor mobility (affects lunges, running, sled push)
  - Ankle dorsiflexion (affects squat depth for wall balls, lunge mechanics)
  - Shoulder mobility (affects SkiErg pull, wall ball catch)
  - Grip and forearm (affects farmers carry, sled pull, rowing)
- Prescribe a 15-minute daily mobility routine targeting these areas
- Prescribe a 5-minute pre-workout activation routine

### Overtraining & Overreaching
- Functional overreaching vs non-functional overreaching vs overtraining syndrome
- Early warning signs an AI coach should monitor:
  - Performance decline (what % drop is concerning?)
  - Resting heart rate elevation (what threshold?)
  - HRV depression (what change is significant?)
  - Sleep disruption
  - Mood/motivation changes
  - Persistent muscle soreness (>72 hours)
- Decision framework: when to push through fatigue vs when to back off
- How to structure a reactive deload (not just planned deloads)

### Nutrition for Training (NOT Race Day)
- Daily caloric needs for a hybrid athlete (~35-40 mpw running + 4-5 strength sessions)
- Macronutrient targets:
  - Protein: g/kg for concurrent training athletes
  - Carbohydrates: g/kg based on training volume (training days vs rest days)
  - Fat: minimum thresholds and optimal ranges
- Pre-workout nutrition: timing and composition for AM vs PM sessions
- Post-workout nutrition: the recovery window — what's evidence-based vs myth?
- Hydration: daily fluid targets, electrolyte needs, sweat rate estimation
- Supplements with actual evidence: creatine, caffeine, beta-alanine, vitamin D, omega-3

## 2. Testing & Benchmarking Protocols

### Baseline Testing Battery
Design a complete baseline testing protocol that an AI coach would administer at Week 0:
- Aerobic capacity: Cooper test or 2km time trial (VO2max estimation)
- Lactate threshold proxy: 30-minute time trial pace
- Running economy: steady-state pace at conversational effort
- Strength baselines: back squat, deadlift, strict press (1RM or estimated)
- Station-specific benchmarks: time trials for each of the 8 Hyrox stations
- Body composition: simple metrics (weight, waist, estimated body fat)

### Monthly Check-In Tests
- Which tests to repeat monthly (and which are less frequent)
- How to interpret month-over-month changes
- What constitutes meaningful improvement vs noise

### Performance Predictors & Targets
- VO2max targets by Hyrox performance tier (sub-60, 60-75, 75-90, 90+)
- Strength-to-bodyweight ratios that correlate with Hyrox performance
- Running pace benchmarks (5K, 10K times) that predict Hyrox performance
- Station-specific benchmarks that indicate race readiness

### Decision Points
For an AI coach, create decision rules:
- "If Cooper test improves by X but station times stagnate → shift training emphasis to..."
- "If strength increases but run pace slows → likely interference, adjust by..."
- "If athlete plateaus for 3+ weeks → implement..."
- Include at least 10 specific if/then decision rules

IMPORTANT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Length: At minimum 4,000 words. This fills critical gaps in the knowledge base.
- Format: Use structured markdown with H2/H3 headers, tables, and numbered lists.
- The mobility routines must be fully prescribed: movement, duration, sets.
- The testing battery must include actual protocols (distances, rest periods, scoring).
- Decision rules must be specific and actionable — not vague guidelines.
- Cite sources: research papers, sports science textbooks, coaching certifications.
