## Prompt for Perplexity

```
You are an equipment specialist building a knowledge base for an AI-powered Hyrox coach. The coach's v1 model made DANGEROUS equipment recommendations (recommending Nike Vaporfly carbon-plate racing flats for Hyrox). This research must provide CORRECT, verified equipment guidance.

## CRITICAL CONTEXT
The AI coach previously recommended Nike Vaporfly Next% as the "#1 Hyrox shoe" claiming "4%+ VO2max improvement from the carbon plate." This is DANGEROUS because:
- Vaporfly has zero lateral stability (ankle injury risk during sled work, burpee broad jumps, lunges)
- No grip on sled push surfaces
- Carbon plate could snap during non-running activities
- Shoe destroyed in one race ($250 wasted)
- The "4% VO2max" claim is wrong (research shows ~4% energy cost reduction, not VO2max)

We need CORRECT information to fix this.

## 1. Footwear for Hyrox

### The Hyrox Shoe Problem
- Why shoe selection is uniquely challenging for Hyrox (8km running + 8 functional fitness stations)
- What properties matter: cushioning (8km running), grip (sled push/pull), lateral stability (lunges, BBJ), durability (convention center floors)
- Why pure running shoes (Vaporfly, Alphafly, any carbon-plate racer) are WRONG for Hyrox
- Why pure lifting shoes (Romaleos, Adipower) are also wrong for Hyrox
- The ideal shoe profile: hybrid cross-trainer with moderate cushion

### Specific Shoe Recommendations
For each shoe, provide: name, price range, pros for Hyrox, cons for Hyrox, best suited for which type of athlete

Top shoes actually used by competitive Hyrox athletes:
- Nike Metcon 9 / Metcon 10
- Reebok Nano X4
- NOBULL Trainer / NOBULL Runner+
- TYR CXT-1 Trainer
- Puma Fuse 2.0 / Puma Fuse 3.0
- GORUCK Ballistic Trainer
- Nike Free Metcon
- Under Armour TriBase Reign
- On Cloud X / On Cloudflow (for runner-dominant athletes)
- Any other shoes commonly seen at Hyrox events

### Shoe Selection by Athlete Type
- Runner-dominant athlete (strong cardio, weaker stations): what to prioritize
- Strength-dominant athlete (strong stations, weaker running): what to prioritize
- First-timer vs experienced competitor recommendations
- Budget options vs premium picks

### What NOT to Wear
- Carbon-plate racing flats (Vaporfly, Alphafly, Endorphin Pro) — explain exactly why
- Minimalist/barefoot shoes (Vibram FiveFingers, Xero) — why
- Heavy lifting shoes (Romaleos, Adipower) — why
- Old/worn-out shoes — grip and support concerns
- Trail running shoes — unnecessary tread, heavy

## 2. Race Day Gear

### What Hyrox Rules Allow and Prohibit
- Official Hyrox equipment rules for the 2024/2025 and 2025/2026 seasons
- What items are prohibited on the course
- What items are provided at stations (do they provide wall balls, sleds, etc.?)
- Can you bring your own jump rope? Chalk? Grips?

### Gloves
- Do experienced Hyrox athletes use gloves?
- When gloves help: farmer carry grip, sled pull rope, wall ball catch
- When gloves hurt: reduced feel, can bunch up
- Best glove types if using them (full finger vs fingerless, material)
- Alternative: chalk, tape, or going bare-handed

### Chalk
- Is chalk allowed at Hyrox events?
- Liquid chalk vs dry chalk rules
- Which stations benefit from chalk (farmer carry, sled pull)
- Practical application tips

### Weightlifting Belt
- Should you wear a weightlifting belt for Hyrox? (ANSWER: Generally NO)
- Why a 4-inch weightlifting belt impedes breathing during 8km of running
- Why no Hyrox station truly requires belt support
- The rare exception: if an athlete has a specific back condition

### Other Gear
- Race belt for bib number (useful to avoid pins)
- Hydration: can you carry water? Where are water stations?
- Headband/sweatband (convention centers are hot)
- Compression gear: any evidence it helps?
- Watch/heart rate monitor considerations
- What to carry in a drop bag / transition area

## 3. What Experienced Athletes Actually Bring

### The Minimal Race Kit
- What does a typical competitive Hyrox athlete bring on race day?
- Essentials vs nice-to-haves
- What to leave at home
- Pre-race area setup

### Common Mistakes
- Overdressing (convention centers are heated)
- Bringing too much gear
- Wearing brand-new untested shoes
- Forgetting nutrition/hydration supplies

Provide specific, verified information with sources where possible. Prioritize information from Hyrox official rules, elite Hyrox coaches, and competitive athletes' actual race day experience. Do NOT speculate — if information isn't available, say so.
