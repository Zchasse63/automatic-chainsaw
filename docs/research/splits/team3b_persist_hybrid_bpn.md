## Prompt for Perplexity

You are a research analyst evaluating commercial training programs for their applicability to Hyrox race preparation. This research will power an AI coaching system.

Analyze these THREE programs in depth:

## 1. Persist (Functional Bodybuilding by Marcus Filly)
- Creator: Marcus Filly (6x CrossFit Games athlete, pioneer of "functional bodybuilding")
- Program overview, target audience, cost
- Core philosophy: controlled tempos, quality movement, sustainable training
- Weekly template and training split
- How Persist programs conditioning vs strength vs hypertrophy
- 3-5 representative sample workouts with full prescriptions (movements, reps, sets, rest, tempo notations)
- Hyrox applicability: what transfers (movement quality, durability), what's missing (running, Hyrox specificity)
- Key programming principles to extract for an AI coach

## 2. Nick Bare's Hybrid Athlete Approach
- Creator: Nick Bare (Army veteran, founder of Bare Performance Nutrition, hybrid athlete)
- His approach to combining marathon/ultra running with heavy strength training
- Weekly training structure: how he balances high running mileage with lifting
- Session design: how he sequences run + lift days
- His periodization approach for races (marathon, 50-miler, Hyrox)
- 3-5 representative sample workouts or training days
- Hyrox applicability: Nick Bare's hybrid model is perhaps the closest existing template to what a Hyrox athlete needs
- Key programming principles to extract

## 3. BPN (Bare Performance Nutrition) Community Training
- What training content and programs BPN offers
- Any structured programming available through their platform
- Training philosophy as expressed through their content
- 3-5 representative sample workouts if available
- Hyrox applicability analysis
- If BPN doesn't have structured programming, document what IS available and note the gap

IMPORTANT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Length: At minimum 3,000 words. Each program deserves a thorough analysis.
- Format: Use structured markdown with H2 for each program, H3 for subsections, markdown tables for training splits.
- Sample workouts MUST be fully prescribed: movements, reps, sets, rest periods, time caps.
- Be honest: if a program doesn't have public information available, say so. Don't fabricate.
- Cite sources: YouTube channels, podcasts, published programs, interviews.
