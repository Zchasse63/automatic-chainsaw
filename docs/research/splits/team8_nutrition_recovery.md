## Prompt for Perplexity

```
You are a sports nutrition and recovery researcher building a knowledge base for an AI-powered Hyrox coach. The coach already has race-day nutrition covered. This research covers DAILY nutrition and recovery for athletes in a 16-week Hyrox preparation program.

## Athlete Profile
- Training ~10-12 hours/week (running + strength + HIIT)
- Running 35-40 miles per week
- 4-5 gym sessions per week
- Goal: Hyrox race performance (60-90 minute race duration)

## 1. Daily Macronutrient Framework

### Caloric Needs
- How to estimate daily caloric needs for this training volume
- Training day vs rest day caloric adjustment
- If the goal is body recomposition (maintain muscle, optimize body fat for performance), what caloric approach?

### Protein
- Optimal daily intake (g/kg) for concurrent endurance + strength training
- Current research consensus: is 1.6-2.2 g/kg still the standard?
- Protein distribution: how many meals, how much per meal, does timing matter?
- Pre-sleep protein: casein or total daily intake is what matters?
- Plant-based athlete considerations

### Carbohydrates
- Daily carb targets by training volume (g/kg)
- Carb periodization: high-carb training days vs moderate rest days
- Pre-workout carb loading: timing and amounts for AM vs PM sessions
- Intra-workout carbs: when is it necessary? (sessions >60 min?)
- Post-workout carb replenishment: how much, how fast?
- Low-carb training days: when (if ever) are they appropriate for a Hyrox athlete?

### Fats
- Minimum daily fat intake for hormonal health
- Optimal range for endurance athletes
- Timing: does fat timing around workouts matter?
- Essential fatty acids: omega-3 supplementation evidence

### Create a Sample Day of Eating
For a 180-lb (82kg) male athlete on a high-training day:
- Exact meals with portions, macros, and timing
- Pre-workout meal/snack
- Post-workout meal/snack
- Evening meal

Do the same for a rest/recovery day.

## 2. Hydration Protocol

### Daily Hydration
- Baseline daily fluid intake formula (bodyweight-based)
- How to assess hydration status (urine color, body weight, thirst)
- Electrolyte needs: sodium, potassium, magnesium — daily targets
- When to use electrolyte drinks vs plain water

### Training Hydration
- Pre-training hydration: how much, how far before
- During training: fluid intake rates for different session types and durations
- Post-training rehydration: how much, what to include
- Sweat rate estimation: practical method for athletes

### Create a hydration schedule for a typical training day

## 3. Evidence-Based Supplements

For each supplement, provide: what it does, dosage, timing, evidence quality (strong/moderate/weak), and specific application for Hyrox training.

### Tier 1 — Strong Evidence
- Creatine monohydrate
- Caffeine
- Vitamin D (especially for indoor-training athletes)
- Protein powder (whey/casein) — as convenience, not requirement

### Tier 2 — Moderate Evidence
- Beta-alanine
- Sodium bicarbonate
- Beetroot juice / nitrates
- Omega-3 fatty acids

### Tier 3 — Weak or Mixed Evidence
- BCAAs/EAAs (when are they actually useful?)
- Collagen peptides (for joint health)
- Ashwagandha
- Tart cherry juice

### What to AVOID
- Supplements with no evidence
- Potentially harmful supplements
- Interactions with training adaptations (e.g., high-dose antioxidants blunting adaptation)

## 4. Sleep Optimization

- Sleep duration targets for this training volume
- Sleep quality metrics that matter (deep sleep %, REM, consistency)
- Pre-bed routine for athletes: evidence-based recommendations
- Napping: when helpful, when harmful, optimal duration
- How poor sleep affects next-day training (quantify the performance impact)
- Practical tips for athletes who struggle with sleep after PM training

## 5. Recovery Modalities — Evidence Review

For each modality, rate evidence quality and provide practical recommendations:

| Modality | Evidence | When to Use | How to Use |
|----------|----------|-------------|------------|

- Foam rolling / self-myofascial release
- Static stretching
- Dynamic stretching
- Cold water immersion / ice baths
- Contrast therapy (hot/cold)
- Sauna / heat exposure
- Compression garments
- Massage / percussion devices (Theragun, etc.)
- Active recovery sessions (easy walking, swimming)

## 6. Nutrition Periodization Across the 16-Week Program

How should nutrition change across training phases?
- Phase 1 (General Prep): fueling for volume building
- Phase 2 (Specific Prep): fueling for increased HIIT density
- Phase 3 (Competition Prep): fueling for peak performance
- Phase 4 (Taper): reducing intake as volume drops, carb loading strategy
- Race week: final nutrition preparation (carb loading protocol, specific meals)

IMPORTANT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Length: At minimum 4,000 words. Nutrition is a daily decision — this needs to be comprehensive.
- Format: Use markdown tables for supplement guide, sample meals, and recovery modalities.
- All recommendations must be QUANTIFIED: grams, milliliters, hours, percentages.
- Cite research: ISSN position stands, ACSM guidelines, recent meta-analyses.
- Avoid bro-science. If evidence is weak, say so.
