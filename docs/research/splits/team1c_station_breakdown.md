You are a research analyst building a knowledge base for an AI-powered Hyrox coach.

Your task is to produce a DETAILED tactical breakdown of ALL 8 Hyrox workout stations. For EACH station, cover every subsection thoroughly.

## Station 1: SkiErg (1000m)
- Optimal technique: arm pull pattern, hip hinge, breathing rhythm
- Common efficiency mistakes and how to fix them
- Target times by performance level (elite / competitive / recreational)
- Muscle groups taxed and how they affect the subsequent 1km run
- Training benchmarks and specific drills

## Station 2: Sled Push (4 x 12.5m = 50m total)
- Optimal body angle, arm position, foot placement, driving technique
- Continuous push vs reset between lengths
- Common mistakes: standing too upright, not using legs, grip issues
- Target times by performance level
- Muscle groups taxed and carryover to the next run
- Training progressions (weight overload, speed work)

## Station 3: Sled Pull (4 x 12.5m = 50m total)
- Hand-over-hand technique vs walking backward
- Rope management, grip strategies
- Common mistakes and fixes
- Target times by performance level
- Muscle groups taxed and carryover to the next run

## Station 4: Burpee Broad Jumps (80m)
- Optimal technique: chest-to-ground, jump distance, efficiency of movement
- Pacing strategy: steady tempo vs push-and-rest
- Common mistakes: jumping too high (not forward), inefficient get-ups
- Target times by performance level
- Muscle groups taxed — this is often the most systemically fatiguing station

## Station 5: Rowing (1000m)
- Optimal technique: drive sequence, stroke rate, damper setting
- Pacing: even split vs negative split for 1000m
- Common mistakes: pulling with arms first, setting damper too high
- Target times and paces by performance level
- Muscle groups taxed and carryover to the next run

## Station 6: Farmers Carry (200m)
- Grip strategies: chalk, hook grip, forearm endurance
- Walking pace and stride length optimization
- When to set down and rest vs pushing through
- Common mistakes: rushing and dropping, poor posture
- Target times by performance level
- How grip fatigue affects remaining stations (sandbag lunges, wall balls)

## Station 7: Sandbag Lunges (100m)
- Front-loaded vs shoulder-carry sandbag position
- Step length and tempo optimization
- Breathing pattern during lunges
- Common mistakes: too-long steps, losing balance, poor posture
- Target times by performance level
- Quad and glute fatigue management heading into wall balls

## Station 8: Wall Balls (75-100 reps depending on division)
- Optimal technique: squat depth, ball catch, throw height
- Break strategy: unbroken, sets of 25, sets of 10 — what's optimal by fitness level
- Breathing rhythm and pacing
- Common mistakes: shallow squats (no-reps), throwing too high
- Target times by performance level
- This is the LAST station — mentality and finishing strategies

IMPORTANT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Length: At minimum 4,000 words. This is the most detailed document — cover every station thoroughly.
- Format: Use structured markdown with H2 for each station, H3 for subsections.
- Include a summary table at the end: Station | Elite Time | Competitive Time | Recreational Time | Key Muscle Groups | #1 Mistake
- Be specific: Include actual times, weights, paces, rep schemes, technique cues.
- Cite sources: Reference coaches, athletes, or Hyrox-specific content creators.
- Write in natural language that matches coaching queries like "what is the best technique for sled push" or "how should I break up wall balls."
