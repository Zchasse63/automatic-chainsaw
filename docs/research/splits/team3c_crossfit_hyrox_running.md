## Prompt for Perplexity

```
You are a research analyst evaluating training programs and methodologies for their applicability to Hyrox race preparation. This research will power an AI coaching system.

Analyze these programs/methodologies AND produce a final comparison matrix:

## 1. CrossFit Programming Principles
- CrossFit.com mainsite programming methodology
- "Constantly varied, high-intensity, functional movement" — how this applies to Hyrox
- Typical CrossFit class structure (warm-up, strength, WOD, cooldown)
- Common WOD formats: AMRAP, For Time, EMOM, Chipper, Tabata
- 3-5 classic CrossFit workouts that would transfer well to Hyrox preparation
- What CrossFit programming gets RIGHT for Hyrox (work capacity, metabolic conditioning, mental toughness)
- What CrossFit programming MISSES for Hyrox (running volume, specific station work, pacing)

## 2. Hyrox Official Training Programs
- Does Hyrox offer an official training app or program? If so, analyze it.
- Hyrox-branded training plans (if available through hyrox.com or partners)
- Hyrox Master Trainer recommendations
- HAOS Training (Hunter McIntyre's platform) — briefly, as this overlaps Team 2
- Any other Hyrox-specific commercial programs (Roxlyfe, etc.)

## 3. Running Programs for Hybrid Athletes
- 80/20 Running (Matt Fitzgerald): the 80% easy / 20% hard principle
  - How this applies to a Hyrox athlete who needs to maintain 35-40 mpw
  - Sample week structure for a hybrid athlete
- Polarized training model for runners who also do strength/HIIT
- How to integrate running programming with Hyrox station work
- Key running workouts every Hyrox athlete should do: tempo runs, intervals, long runs, easy runs

## 4. COMPARISON MATRIX (Critical — this synthesizes all Team 3 research)

Create a comprehensive markdown table comparing ALL programs analyzed across Teams 3a, 3b, and 3c:

| Program | Focus Area | Sessions/Week | Conditioning Style | Strength Method | Running Component | Hyrox Readiness (1-10) | Best For |
|---------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------|

Include: PRVN, HWPO, CompTrain, Persist, Nick Bare Hybrid, CrossFit, Hyrox Official, 80/20 Running

For the Hyrox Readiness score, provide a 1-2 sentence justification for each rating.

IMPORTANT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Length: At minimum 3,000 words.
- Format: Use structured markdown with H2/H3 headers and markdown tables.
- The comparison matrix is the most important deliverable — make it comprehensive.
- Be specific about what an AI coach should steal from each program's methodology.
- Cite sources: websites, books, podcast episodes, athlete content.
