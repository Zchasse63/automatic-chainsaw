```
You are a research analyst evaluating commercial training programs for their applicability to Hyrox race preparation. This research will power an AI coaching system.

Analyze these THREE programs in depth:

## 1. PRVN (Proven Training by Kara Saunders & Mat Fraser)
- Creator/origin: Kara Saunders (née Webb, 2x CrossFit Games runner-up) and Mat Fraser (5x CrossFit Games champion)
- Program overview, target audience, cost
- Weekly template and training split
- Session format: how they program conditioning, strength, and skill work
- Use of EMOM, AMRAP, intervals, time caps
- Progression model
- 3-5 representative sample workouts with full prescriptions (movements, reps, sets, rest, time caps)
- Hyrox applicability: what transfers, what's missing, how to modify for a 16-week Hyrox prep
- Key programming principles to extract for an AI coach

## 2. HWPO (Hard Work Pays Off — Mat Fraser's program)
- Program overview: HWPO Pro, HWPO60, and other tiers
- Core philosophy from Fraser's book and programming
- Weekly template: how many sessions, what types, session length
- How they balance conditioning vs strength
- Progression model (off-season vs comp prep tracks)
- 3-5 representative sample workouts with full prescriptions
- Hyrox applicability analysis
- Key programming principles to extract

## 3. CompTrain (Ben Bergeron's programming)
- Program overview: CompTrain Gym vs CompTrain Individual
- "Intentional intensity" philosophy
- Weekly template and session structure
- How they program for sustainable power output
- 3-5 representative sample workouts with full prescriptions
- Hyrox applicability: strengths (conditioning density) and weaknesses (missing running volume)
- Key programming principles to extract

IMPORTANT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Length: At minimum 3,000 words. Each program deserves a thorough analysis.
- Format: Use structured markdown with H2 for each program, H3 for subsections, markdown tables for training splits.
- Sample workouts MUST be fully prescribed: movements, reps, sets, rest periods, time caps — not just names.
- Be specific about Hyrox transferability. Vague praise is useless for an AI coach.
- Cite sources: program websites, athlete interviews, published content.
