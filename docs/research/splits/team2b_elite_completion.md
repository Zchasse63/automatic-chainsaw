## Prompt for Perplexity

```
You are a research analyst building a knowledge base for an AI-powered Hyrox coach. A previous research task covered Hunter McIntyre, Jake Dearden, Dan Churchill, and Jason Khalipa but was INCOMPLETE. Your task is to fill the gaps.

## 1. Rich Froning — CrossFit Legend Entering Hyrox

Rich Froning is arguably the most decorated CrossFit athlete ever (4x individual CrossFit Games champion, multiple team championships). He has begun competing in Hyrox events.

Research and document:
- His Hyrox race results and times (any available)
- How his CrossFit background translates to Hyrox performance
- His training philosophy: "general physical preparedness" (GPP) approach
- How he balances CrossFit and Hyrox preparation
- His daily training structure and volume
- Specific adaptations he made for Hyrox (if documented)
- His coaching perspective: what advice has he given for hybrid athletes?
- Key quotes or insights from interviews, podcasts, or social media

## 2. Station-Specific Training Methods (ALL Elite Athletes)

For each of the following athletes — Hunter McIntyre, Jake Dearden, Rich Froning, Dan Churchill, Jason Khalipa — document how they specifically train for Hyrox stations:

### Sled Work (Push + Pull)
- Specific sled training protocols (weight, distance, frequency)
- Technique cues they emphasize
- How they build sled endurance vs power

### SkiErg & Rowing
- Interval protocols (what distances, what paces, what rest)
- Pacing strategies for 1000m efforts within a race
- How they integrate erg work into weekly programming

### Wall Balls
- Endurance protocols (how do they build from 25 unbroken to 100?)
- Break strategies used in competition
- Breathing patterns and technique cues

### Burpee Broad Jumps
- Training protocols for BBJ efficiency
- How they practice pacing over 80m
- Technique optimization (jump distance vs speed)

### Farmers Carry & Sandbag Lunges
- Grip training protocols
- Walking pace and stride optimization
- How they build carry/lunge endurance

## 3. CrossFit-to-Hyrox Translation Guide

For athletes transitioning from CrossFit to Hyrox:
- What CrossFit skills transfer directly?
- What gaps does a typical CrossFit athlete have?
- How should they modify their training (timeline, priorities)?
- Common mistakes CrossFit athletes make in their first Hyrox
- The "GPP to specific prep" transition framework

IMPORTANT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Length: At minimum 3,000 words.
- Format: Use structured markdown with H2/H3 headers and markdown tables.
- Be specific: actual weights, distances, paces, rep schemes from real training.
- If information isn't publicly available for an athlete, say so honestly.
- Cite sources: YouTube, podcasts, Instagram, published interviews.
