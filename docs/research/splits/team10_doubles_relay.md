You are a Hyrox rules expert building a knowledge base for an AI-powered Hyrox coach. The coach's v1 model made CRITICAL errors about the Doubles format — it told athletes they could "split the runs 50/50" between partners. This is IMPOSSIBLE in Hyrox Doubles. This research must provide the CORRECT, verified rules.

## CRITICAL CONTEXT
The AI coach previously said:
- "Split the runs 50/50"
- "If she's significantly better, she takes 6 runs, you take 4"
- Then contradicted itself: "Critical rule: You must run together on all 8 runs"
- Listed only 3 stations per partner (6 total) instead of 4 per partner (8 total)

ALL of this is wrong or self-contradictory. We need 100% accurate Doubles/Relay rules.

## 1. Hyrox Doubles — Official Rules

### The Fundamental Rule
- BOTH partners MUST run ALL 8 x 1km runs TOGETHER
- You CANNOT split, alternate, or divide the runs in any way
- Both partners must cross the run timing mats together (or within what margin?)
- What happens if one partner is significantly faster — do they wait?

### Station Splitting
- How many stations does each partner do? (Answer should be 4 each, for 8 total)
- How are stations assigned — is it alternating? Can partners choose?
- Must the split be decided in advance or can you change during the race?
- Is there a required alternating pattern (Partner A does stations 1, 3, 5, 7 and Partner B does 2, 4, 6, 8) or can you choose freely?
- What happens during your partner's station — where do you wait?
- Can you coach/encourage your partner during their station?

### Station Splitting Strategy
- Optimal splitting strategies based on partner strengths
  - Example: If Partner A is stronger upper body, Partner B stronger lower body
  - Example: If one partner is significantly taller/heavier
  - Example: If one partner has better cardio vs better strength
- Which stations are considered "easier" vs "harder" for splitting purposes
- Common splitting mistakes
- Does the non-working partner get to rest (and for how long typically)?

### Doubles Weights
- Are Doubles weights the same as individual Open division?
- Are they the same as individual Pro division?
- Complete weight table for Doubles (sled push, sled pull, sandbag, wall ball, farmer carry)
- Men's Doubles vs Women's Doubles vs Mixed Doubles weight differences

### Doubles Pacing
- Running pace strategy when partners have different speeds
- How to manage the run when one partner is faster
- Heart rate management — the faster partner gets "rest" on runs, the slower partner works harder
- How to use the station rest strategically

### Doubles Transitions
- Where does the non-working partner stand during stations?
- Is there a designated transition zone?
- Any rules about touching/helping your partner at stations?
- Timing: does the clock run continuously? How are station times recorded?

### Training for Doubles
- Should partners train together? How often?
- How to practice running together at matched pace
- Simulating station transitions in training
- Identifying which partner does which station — how to decide

## 2. Hyrox Relay — Official Rules

### Format
- How many athletes per Relay team? (Should be 4)
- How are runs and stations divided among 4 people?
- Does each person run all runs or only some?
- Station assignment rules

### Relay Weights
- Are Relay weights different from Singles or Doubles?
- Weight table for Relay divisions

### Relay Strategy
- How to optimize athlete-to-station assignment
- Running order considerations
- Transition rules and logistics

## 3. Common Misconceptions

List and correct the most common misconceptions about Hyrox Doubles and Relay:
- "You can split the runs" (NO — both must run all 8)
- "You alternate stations 50/50" (need to verify exact rules)
- "Doubles is half the work" (NO — you still run all 8km)
- Any other common mistakes

## 4. Mixed Doubles vs Same-Sex Doubles

- Weight differences between Mixed Doubles and Same-Sex Doubles
- Any rule differences
- Strategy differences
- Which is more popular?

Provide ONLY verified information from official Hyrox sources, race manuals, and competitive Doubles athletes. This is the area where our model is MOST wrong — accuracy is paramount. If a rule cannot be verified, explicitly state that.
