## Prompt for Perplexity

```
You are a Hyrox technique and pacing specialist building a knowledge base for an AI-powered Hyrox coach. The coach needs accurate technique consensus from elite coaches AND realistic pacing benchmarks. The v1 model had several issues:
- Listed "Arms locked out" as a sled push MISTAKE (many elite coaches recommend it)
- Gave BBJ time of 2:45 in a 75-minute pacing plan (unrealistically fast)
- Recommended SkiErg stroke rate of 35-40 SPM (too high for most athletes)
- Didn't know wall ball target heights

## 1. Sled Push Technique — Expert Consensus

### The Arm Position Debate
This is genuinely controversial among Hyrox coaches. Research BOTH sides:

**Camp 1: Extended/Locked Arms**
- Who advocates this? (specific coaches, athletes)
- Reasoning: maximizes force transfer from legs through rigid kinetic chain
- When is this best: heavy sled, strong legs, good ankle mobility
- Drawback: less control, harder to steer

**Camp 2: Bent Arms (90-120 degrees)**
- Who advocates this?
- Reasoning: better control, can push through turns, more body engagement
- When is this best: lighter sled, technical courses with turns
- Drawback: arms fatigue, less direct force transfer

**What do ELITE Hyrox athletes actually do?**
- Watch race footage descriptions or interviews
- Is there a dominant technique at the Pro level?

### Other Sled Push Technique Points
- Body angle: how low should you be?
- Foot position: wide vs narrow stance
- Step cadence: short choppy steps vs long strides
- Driving through the balls of feet vs flat foot
- Head position: looking down at sled vs looking forward
- How surface type affects technique (concrete vs rubber vs turf)

## 2. Sled Pull Technique Consensus

### Hand-Over-Hand vs Big Arm Pulls
- Which technique is faster?
- Which is more sustainable for 50m?
- Does rope thickness/type matter?
- Body position during pull (seated vs kneeling vs standing)
- Foot bracing strategy
- Common mistakes (not bracing feet, pulling too high)

## 3. Burpee Broad Jump Technique

### Efficient BBJ Technique
- Step-down vs jump-back for the burpee portion
- Do you need full chest-to-floor? What's the standard?
- Jump distance optimization: how far should each jump be?
- Landing technique to absorb impact
- Arm swing for momentum
- Breathing pattern for BBJs

### Realistic BBJ Time Targets
- For a 60-minute finisher (elite): what BBJ time?
- For a 70-minute finisher (competitive): what BBJ time?
- For a 75-minute finisher (intermediate): what BBJ time? (NOT 2:45 — that's unrealistic)
- For an 80-minute finisher: what BBJ time?
- For a 90-minute finisher (recreational): what BBJ time?

## 4. SkiErg Technique & Pacing

### Stroke Rate Ranges
- Beginner race pace: what SPM?
- Intermediate race pace: what SPM? (research suggests 28-35, NOT 35-40)
- Elite race pace: what SPM?
- Why going above 38-40 SPM is counterproductive for most athletes
- How to find YOUR optimal stroke rate

### Pacing Strategy
- Negative split vs even split vs positive split — which is best?
- First 250m pacing (should be conservative)
- What split time per 500m for various finish time targets?
- Heart rate targets during SkiErg

## 5. Rowing Technique & Pacing in Hyrox

### Hyrox-Specific Rowing
- Damper setting by athlete weight and height (this is athlete-specific)
- Why Hyrox rowing is different from a standalone 1000m test
- Pacing: what 500m split to target for various finish times?
- Common mistakes: pulling too hard early, improper damper setting
- Stroke rate ranges for Hyrox rowing (typically lower than SkiErg)

## 6. Wall Ball Technique

### Target Heights
- Men's target height: what is it exactly? (should be ~3m / 10ft)
- Women's target height: what is it exactly? (should be ~2.7m / 9ft)
- Ball weights by division (Men Open, Women Open, Pro, etc.)

### Break Strategy for 100 Reps
- Unbroken strategy: when is this advisable? For whom?
- Common break patterns: 25-25-25-25 vs 20-20-20-20-20 vs 50-50
- What research/coaching says about optimal break strategy
- How to determine YOUR break strategy based on wall ball max test
- Breathing during wall balls (exhale on push, inhale on catch)

## 7. Farmer's Carry Technique
- Grip strategies to prevent failure
- Posture and walking gait
- When to put weights down vs push through
- Realistic time targets by finish level

## 8. Sandbag Lunge Technique
- How to hold the sandbag (bear hug vs shoulder)
- Knee-to-ground requirement
- Step length optimization
- Managing quad fatigue (this is the LAST station before final run)
- Why this station destroys the final 1km run

## 9. Station-Specific Breathing Patterns

For each of the 8 stations, describe the recommended breathing pattern:
- SkiErg: exhale on pull, inhale on recovery (1:1 with strokes)
- Sled Push: ?
- Sled Pull: ?
- Burpee Broad Jumps: ?
- Rowing: ?
- Farmer's Carry: ?
- Sandbag Lunges: ?
- Wall Balls: ?

## 10. Comprehensive Pacing Plans

### For a 60-Minute Target (Elite/Pro)
Provide expected times for: each 1km run, each station, total transition time

### For a 70-Minute Target (Competitive)
Same breakdown

### For a 80-Minute Target (Intermediate)
Same breakdown — this is where MOST athletes fall

### For a 90-Minute Target (Recreational/First-Timer)
Same breakdown

### How Each Station Affects the Subsequent Run
- After SkiErg: how are legs? Arms? HR?
- After Sled Push: how are legs? (quads especially)
- After Sled Pull: how are arms/grip?
- After BBJs: how is everything? (full body fatigue)
- After Rowing: how are legs? Posterior chain?
- After Farmer's Carry: how are forearms? Shoulders?
- After Sandbag Lunges: how are quads? (destroyed — final run is brutal)
- After Wall Balls: how is everything for the finish sprint?

Provide specific, evidence-based information. Cite elite coaches, athletes, or studies where possible. For time benchmarks, use data from actual race results, not theoretical calculations.
